CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 03-01-2017, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Ferre 2017/KER/52 Cri.MC.No. 3949 of 2016 () APPENDIX PETITIONER'S EXHIBITS: ANNEXURE-! CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FRIST INFORMATION REPORT. ANNEXURE-II CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT. RESPONDENT'S EXHIBITS: NIL R.AV TRUE COPY!/ PATO JUDGE SUNIL THOMAS, J. OE! Crl.M.C.No.3949 of 2016 Dated this the 3 day of January, 2017 ORDER The petitioner herein is the 6\" accused in CC.No.96 of 2016 on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court- I, Kozhikode for the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 341, 323, 332, 427 read with 149 of the Indian Penal Code. 2. The crux on the prosecution allegation is that a team of shadow police was on their duty at 10 pm on 22.05.2015. They intercepted a group of six persons who were drinking in a public place. When they were asked to move out of the place, they questioned the shadow police and even after revealing the identity, they insisted for, seeing their identity cards. Thereafter they were challenged, abused and beaten on the various parts of the body. Crime was registered thereafter. In the meanwhile it is further stated that keys of the their vehicles were also taken away by the group. They were saved by the police who had reached the spot after 2017/KER/52 Crl.M.C.No.3949 of 2016 2 receiving the information. After investigation final report was laid. 3. The specific contention of the petitioner is that even as per the police records, he reached the spot later and he has been wrongly implicated. The available records do not support that stand. Since specific overtacts are attributed to the petitioner herein also. Having regard to this fact, I feel that it is a matter to be agitated before the court below. I am not inclined to consider this Crl.M.C at this stage. It is dismissed reserving the right of the petitioner herein to move for discharge if so advised. Crl.M.C is dismissed.
