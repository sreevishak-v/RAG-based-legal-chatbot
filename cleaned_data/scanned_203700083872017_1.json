Dated this the 8 day of January, 2018 ORDER The petitioner is arrayed as the sole accused in Crime No.323/2017 of Tirur Police Station for offences punishable under Sections 450, 376(2)(i)(n) of Indian Penal Code and Section 5(1), 6 of the POCSO Act. It was alleged by the de facto complainant, who is a 14 year old girl, that the accused, who was a neighbour of the de facto complainant sexually abused her. It was alleged by her that while she had gone to the house of the accused, he forcefully undressed her, inserted his finger into her private parts and rubbed his private part against the private part of the girl. Pursuant to an FIS laid, crime was registered. After investigation final report was filed. Cognizance was taken and the matter is now pending as S.C. No.628/2017 of Additional Sessions court, Manjeri. 2. The petitioner has approached this Court contending that the dispute with the de facto complainant was amicably settled and that the de facto complainant has no further grievance. To buttress that contention, learned counsel for the petitioner relied on Annexures A5 and A6 affidavits affirmed by pal 2018/KER/722 Cri. M. C. No. 8387 of 2017 2 the victim as well as her mother. Learned counsel for the 2\" respondent, who is the victim, acknowledged the due execution of the above affidavits and submitted that she has no objection in quashing the proceedings. 3. The learned Public Prosecutor submitted that the statement of the victim has been recorded and the settlement has been reported to the Police. It was also submitted that the petitioner is not involved in any other crime. 4. Considering the serious nature of allegations raised against the petitioner, this Court was not inclined to quash the criminal proceedings on the basis of an agreement between the parties. Hence, learned counsel for the petitioner chose to argue the matter on merits. 5. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, learned Public Prosecutor and the learned counsel for the 2\"? respondent. 6. Learned counsel for the petitioner invited my attention to the report of the Medico Legal Examination of the Survival of the Sexual Offence dated 17.04.2017. The Doctor had physical examination of the victim and found that there was no injury on her private parts. The hymen was intact and it was noted that no pal 2018/KER/722 Cri. M. C. No. 8387 of 2017 3 injuries were seen at present though the assault allegedly occurred about one month back. The records reveal that some of the other witnesses who were questioned, did not refer to the alleged sexual abuse. In the nature of evidence gathered, the prosecution has to rely essentially on the oral testimony of the victim. However, it seems that the victim was examined before the Magistrate under Section 164 Cr.P.C. A copy of Section 164 Cr.P.C. statement has been produced by the petitioner. In the course of examination, specific question was put to the victim regarding the complaint against the petitioner herein. She feigned ignorance. She stated that the petitioner herein was looking after the family affairs of the de facto complainant. She feigned ignorance regarding the complaint laid to the Police against the accused. She could not state as to who has given the complaint against the accused. A perusal of the above statement discloses that the accused has not stated anything touching upon the serious allegations made in the F] statement. Evidently, in her Section 164 Cr.P.C. statement she has not given any incriminating statement touching upon the sexual abuse. 7. It is evident that, in the light of a claimed settlement, Bil 2018/KER/722 Cri. M. C. No. 8387 of 2017 4 the possibility of the victim supporting the prosecution case is exceptionally remote. The quality of evidence gathered by the prosecution is such that there is no chance for a successful prosecution of the crime. Having considered these, | feel that continuance of the proceedings is not likely to serve any fruitful purpose. Hence, Cri.M.C. is allowed. All further proceedings in S.C. No.628/2017 of Additional Sessions court, Manjeri stand quashed. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE. Pn"
