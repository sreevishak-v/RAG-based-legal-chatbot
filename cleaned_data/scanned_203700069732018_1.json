CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 11.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Crl.MC.No.6973 OF 2018 2 202 1/KER/T767 ORDER A consignment of 24 bottles of \"Pankajakasthuri Breath Easy' was entrusted with a courier company, the accused for exporting the same to America. But, the customs authorities objected its export on the ground that it is not a commercial goods, but medicinal goods which requires certain other legal formalities. Hence the same was returned by the courier company along with the charge received in that behalf. But the crime was registered on the allegation that he sustained heavy loss on account of its non-export. No one can be permitted to plead ignorance regarding the requirements to be complied with while exporting medicinal goods. The failure on the part of the complainant to comply with the said requirement cannot be placed on the shoulder of the accused. Further, no criminal oo Cr1.MC.No.6973 OF 2018 3 202 1/KER/T767 liability can be extended on the accused for the wrong done by the defacto complainant. The crime registered on the allegation of offence under Section 420 IPC is really ill-conceived and ill-motivated, without satisfying the requirement which would constitute Section 415 IPC. Hence, the entire crime and the further proceedings are quashed. Crl1.M.C. is allowed accordingly. Sd/- P.
