KEMAL PASHA, J. ee ee ORDER Annexure A6 order passed under Section 319 Cr.PC. by the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-l, Kanjirappally for arraigning the petitioner as the 4\" accused in C.C.No.221/2013 is under challenge. Originally, the petitioner was arraigned as the 4\" accused in the FIR. After investigation, Annexure A1 final report was filed as against A1 to A3 alone by deleting A4 from the array of accused. 2. The prosecution examined PWs.1 and 2 in chief before the court below. It seems that the chief-examination itself is not complete. Material objects were not produced and therefore, the material objects were to be identified, for which the chief-examination has to continue. Bee 2017/KER/49291 CRL.M.C.No. 5370 of 2016 2: 3. PW1, who is the defacto complainant, filed Annexure A5 petition before the court below under Section 319 CrPC. for arraigning the petitioner also as the 4\" accused in the case. The court below passed Annexure A6 order in the following lines: Heard the petitioner's counsel. On a perusal of the deposition of PW1 and PW2 in their chief examinations it is clear that the complicity of 4 accused in FIR, that is Harris is established in the commission of the alleged offences. Hence the petition is allowed. 4. According to the learned counsel for the petitioner, the court below has committed a grave error in not passing a speaking order. The circumstances in which the application of Section 319 CrPC. has become necessitated, have not been shown in Annexure 6. The learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the learned counsel for the 2\" respondent have relied on the decision of ae 2017/KER/49291 CRL.M.C.No. 5370 of 2016 uae the Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in Hardeep Singh and others v. State of Punjab[2014(1) KHC 170] wherein specific parameters have been prescribed for enabling the application of Section 319 Cr.PC. 5. According to the petitioner, the details of the petitioner who has to be impleaded as the 4\" accused have not been furnished. Apart from stating that Harris of Kanjirappally, details of the petitioner and his address have not been furnished anywhere in the chief-examination of PWs.1 and 2 or Annexure 5. In Annexure A5 what has been stated is that the 4\" accused in the FIR has to be arraigned as the 4\" accused in the case. On a perusal of Annexure A1 FIR in page No.22 of the paper book, it seems that the 4\" accused, who was arraigned in the FIR, was Harris relative of Shameer. Without furnishing the details of the persons to be arraigned as accused, the court below ought not to have passed an order arraigning the petitioner as the 4\" accused. Apart from that, the court below ought to have 2017/KER/49291 CRL.M.C.No. 5370 of 2016 wae shown cogent reasons for arraigning the petitioner as the 4\" accused under Section 319 CrPC. It is not discernible from Annexure A6 as to how the learned Magistrate could invoke Section 319 CrPC. In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure A6 order is hereby quashed. Annexure Ad is remitted to the court below for fresh disposal in accordance with law. The court below shall scrupulously follow the decision in Hardeep Singh(supra) for disposing of Annexure A5.
