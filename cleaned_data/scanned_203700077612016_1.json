Dated this the 4\" day of January, 2017 ORDER The petitioner herein is the accused in O.R.No.1/2012 of DRI, Calicut for offence punishable under Section 135 of the Customs Act, 1962. In the above case, the allegation was that, the petitioner herein had transported to India 3.5 kgs of gold from abroad. He was granted bail by Annexure 1 order inter alia on a condition that the original passport of the accused shall not be released by the DRI till the trial is over. Subsequently by an order of this Court in Crl.M.C. No.2644/2013, a copy of which is produced as Annexure 2, this Court reiterated that the passport cannot be released, since using the very same passport he had illegally imported 3.5 kgs of gold to India. The matter is still pending before Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate (E.O), Ernakulam. Hence, | feel that time is not ripe for releasing the passport. Crl.M.C. fails and is dismissed.
