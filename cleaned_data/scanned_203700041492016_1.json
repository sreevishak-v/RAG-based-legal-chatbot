The allegation of the prosecution is that, on 09.04.2015 while the de facto complainant was proceeding on a scooter along with his wife, accused waylaid him, took out his helmet and hit on his body. Wife also allegedly suffered some injury. On the basis of the complaint laid, crime was registered and the matter is being investigated. While so, parties have resolved their disputes and all terms and conditions between the parties in relation to the settlement has been narrowed down in the form of Annexure-A3 agreement. Pursuant to that, an affidavit has been filed by the de facto complainant as Annexure-A2. 3. Both counsel submitted that, though there is an allegation in the FIS that the wife had also sustained injury, in fact, she did not go to the hospital nor did the police take her statement. Neither party has got a case now that the wife was 2016/KER/33873 Cri.M.C.4149/16 2 also injured. Having regard to this, I am satisfied that the parties have resolved their disputes evidenced by Annexures-A2 and A3. Learned Public Prosecutor on instructions submitted that the petitioner is not involved in any other case. Having regard to these facts, I am inclined to take a lenient view and to grant the relief sought for. In the result, Crl.M.C is allowed. Entire proceedings arising from Crime No.462 of 2015 of Viyoor Police Station stand quashed. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS Judge Sbna/4/8/16 True Copy / P A to Judge"
