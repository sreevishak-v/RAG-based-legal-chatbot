No. 6870 of 2015 Dated 1 June, 2016 ORDER 1.The petitioners herein are accused Nos. 1 and 2 in S.T. No. 2813 of 2012 on the files of the Judicial Magistrate of 1* Class, Thiruvalla involving offences punishable under Sections 188, 147, 148, 149, 427, 294(b) and 506(i) of the IPC. 2.Prosecution allegation is that the petitioners and the other accused persons in the crime trespassed into the property of the de facto complainant on 07.06.2007 and committed mischief by cutting open a pathway after violating the order of injunction in O.S.No. 79 of 2006 of the learned Subordinate Judges Court. Initially crime No. 138 of 2007 was registered by the Pulikeezhu Police which was later referred. Thereafter, on the basis of the complaint filed by the de facto complainant cognizance was taken as S.T. No. 691 of 2008. The petitioners did not appear before the court below and the case was proceeded against as against accused Nos. 1 to 4. Diseeirrl s01eikERI3872 Crl.M.C. No. 6870 of 2015 -2- 3.As per Annexure 2 judgment dated 31.10.2012, the accused Nos. 1 to 4 were extended the benefit of doubt and were acquitted under Section 255(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submits that in view of the acquittal of the co- accused, the continuance of proceedings as against the petitioners would be nothing but waste of time and the prospects of entering upon a conviction on the same evidence is quite bleak. 4.The learned Public Prosecutor oppose the contentions of the petitioners and submitted that a perusal of Annexure 2 judgment would reveal that both PW1 and PW2 had deposed in tune with the prosecution version and the learned Magistrate had acquitted the accused on the sole ground that the evidence against them did not appear to be credible. Non-examination of the neighbours was considered fatal and it was one of the reasons why the accused were acquitted. According to the learned Public Prosecutor, the ratio of the Full Bench decision of this Court in Moosa v. Sub Inspector of Police (2006 (1) Diseeirrl rapa a 2016/KER/23872 Crl.M.C. No. 6870 of 2015 -3- KLT 552) will not apply to the facts of the instant case as it cannot be said that the substratum of the case itself has been destroyed. 5.I have heard the rival submissions. After perusing Annexure 2 judgment it does not appear to me that this Court will be justified in quashing the proceedings on the sole ground that the co-accused have been acquitted. The judgment rendered in the case of a co-accused and the reasoning of the judgment contained therein or appreciation of the evidence therein are not matters to be taken into account for the purpose of granting any relief to quash the proceedings and thus bar the trial itself. In other words, the acquittal of some of the accused by itself is not a reason to bar the trial in the case of the other accused. I am of the view that this Court will not be justified in exercising powers under Section 482 of the Code in the instant case to quash the proceedings on the ground that the substratum of the case has been shattered. 6.At this stage the learned counsel prays that direction be Ea Bisnae 2016/KER/23872 Crl.M.C. No. 6870 of 2015 ~4- issued to the learned Magistrate to dispose off the matter in an expeditious manner. I don't find any reason to refuse the said prayer. In the result the petition is disposed off, directing the learned Judicial Magistrate of 1% Class, Thiruvalla where S.T.No.2813 of 2012 is pending, to dispose off the said matter in an expeditious manner, at any rate, within a period of 8 months from the date of production of this order.
