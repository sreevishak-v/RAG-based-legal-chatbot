CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 08.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: ua CRL.M.C.NO.7456/2018 2 2021/KERMTA18 ORDER Dated this the 8th day of January 2021 This Crl.M.C. is filed to quash the entire proceedings in C.C.No.1124 of 2018 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Thrissur. It is a case charge sheeted by the Town West Police Station, Thrissur against the petitioners and another alleging offences punishable under Sections 506(1) and 323 r/w. Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. The offence under Section 23 of the Juvenile Justice (Care & Protection of Children) Act is also alleged. 2. This Crl.M.C. is filed to quash the above proceedings mainly on the ground that, the incident in this happened happened in connection with a matrimonial dispute between the 1** petitioner and the 2 respondent. According to the counsel for the petitioners the entire disputes are settled as per Annexure A3 and all a CRL.M.C.NO.7456/2018 3 2021/KER/TA18 the cases are compromised based on Annexure A3 compromise. Now the 2 respondent is not withdrawing the present case and hence this Crl.M.C. is filed to quash the proceedings. 3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned counsel for the 2 respondent also. 4. The learned counsel for the 2\" respondent submitted that, there is a counter case to C.C.No.1124 of 2018 in which the 2\" respondent and two minor children are the accused. She and her minor children approached this Court with an application under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to quash that proceedings. But as per the order dated 16.12.2020 in Crl.M.C.No.7062 of 2015 this Court dismissed that application. The counsel submitted that, the 2 respondent has no objection in gquashing the proceedings in C.C.No.1124 of 2018 if the proceedings in the counter case is also quashed. ua CRL.M.C.NO.7456/2018 4 2021/KERMTA18 5. The main reason for dismissing Crl1.M.C.No.7062 of 2015 was that the prayer in that petition was to quash the F.I.R. Now it is clear that a final report is filed in the counter case also. If that is the case, the 2 respondent can file a fresh petition to quash the final report in the counter case, to which the petitioners have no objection. Therefore, I think, this Crl.M.C. can be disposed of with a liberty to the petitioners to file a fresh Cr1.M.C. to quash the proceedings in C.C.No.1124 of 2018 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Thrissur once the proceedings in Crime No.1349 of 2014 of the Town West Police Station, Thrissur is quashed. The counsel for the 2 respondent submitted that, the 2x respondent has no objection in getting exemption to the petitioners from the lower court in C.C.No.1124 of 2018 if an application for exemption is filed by the petitioners in a CRL.M.C.NO.7456/2018 5 2021/KERMTA18 accordance to law. Hence, this Crl.M.C. is disposed of with the following directions: i) If an application is filed by the petitioners for exemption in C.C.No.1124 of 2018, the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Thrissur will allow the same in accordance to law; ii) The petitioners are given liberty to file a fresh Crl.M.C. to quash the proceedings in C.C.No.1124 of 2018 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Thrissur once the proceedings in Crime No.1349 of 2014 of the Town West Police Station, Thrissur is quashed.
