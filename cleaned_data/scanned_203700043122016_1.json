ANNEXURE B: AFFIDAVIT FILED BY 2ND RESPONDENT. RESPONDENT (S)' ANNEXURE: NIL //TRUE COPY// P.S.TO JUDGE Msv/ eats 2016/KER/33879 RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN, V., J. Dated this the 3 day of August, 2016 ORDER 1.The petitioners herein are the accused Nos. 1 to 6 in Crime No.234 of 2016 of the Melattur Police Station. They are proceeded against for having committed offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 323, 506 and 149 IPC and Section 3(1)(v) of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The 2 respondent is the victim. 2.The instant petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure banking on the ratio of the Judgment rendered by the Apex Court in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab ( 2012 (4) KLT 108) and a series of other cases which include Narinder Singh and others v. State of Punjab and another (2014) 6 SCC 466) and BEE 2016/KER/33879 Cril.M.C. No.4312 of 2016 -2- Yogendra Yadav and others V State of Jharkhand [2014 (9) SCC 653] with a prayer to quash the above proceeding. 3.The sole ground is that the Apex Court in the above judgments have delineated the circumstances and the cases in which inherent powers under Section 482 can be invoked de hors section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for recognizing out of court settlement for the purpose of quashing criminal proceedings. It is prayed that powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure be invoked to quash the criminal proceedings . 4.It is submitted that the parties have reached an out of court settlement and there is no acrimony between them at present. All the disputes have been amicably resolved and they desire to live in peace and harmony. The 2\" respondent has sworn to an affidavit wherein he asserts that he has no objection in terminating the proceedings. bree) 2016/KER/33879 Cril.M.C. No.4312 of 2016 -3- 5.The crux of the prosecution allegation is that on 26.05.2016 at about 8.30 p.m., the petitioners along with other accused formed themselves into an_ unlawful assembly and _ voluntarily caused hurt to the 2\" respondent. 6.The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submits that no other cases of heinous nature are reported against the petitioners. 7.1 have bestowed my anxious consideration to the submissions made across the bar and I have also gone through the materials on record. 8.The victim has sworn to an affidavit wherein it is asserted that he has no objection in allowing the petition and in quashing the proceedings as all the disputes between the parties have been resolved and the parties are living in peace and harmony . 9.It appears to me that the offence is entirely personal in apa 2016/KER/33879 Cril.M.C. No.4312 of 2016 -4- nature and do not affect public peace or tranquility. It is also felt that quashing of proceedings on account of compromise would bring about peace. In a case such as the instant one, even if the prosecution is allowed to continue, it would not serve any purpose as the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak. It can only result in putting the de facto complainant and the accused to unwanted oppression and prejudice. Settlement will augur well for the interest of the community and will enable the parties to live in peace and harmony. 10.. am of the view that this Court is well justified in quashing the impugned proceedings as the instant case falls within the matrix of guidelines issued by the Apex Court in Gian Singh ( Supra ) and the other cases referred to above. In the result, this petition is allowed. All further proceedings against the petitioners, who are the accused pee 2016/KER/33879 Cri.M.C. No.4312 of 2016 -~5- Nos. 1 to 6 in Crime No.234 of 2016 of the Melattur Police Station, are quashed. Sd/- RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN, V. JUDGE Ps/5/8/16"
