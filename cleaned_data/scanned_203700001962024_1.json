CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 10.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Oo eae 2024/KER/2380 CRL.MC NO. 196 OF 2024 2 BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J. ~ GrLLM.C.No.196 of 2024 Dated this the 10\" day of January, 2024 ORDER Petitioners are accused Nos.1 to 3 in C.C.No.414 of 2020 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Thamarassery alleging offences under Sections 341 and 323 r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. 2. According to the prosecution, on 12.03.2020 at about 5.50 a.m., while the defacto complainant was proceeding in a motor bike, the accused intercepted him and dashed against his bike using a car and thereafter assaulted him. While the 2 respondent tore the shirt of the defacto complainant, the 3 accused restrained the defacto complainant and thereby the accused committed the offences alleged. 3. Sri.N.K.Shyju, the learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that even going by the prosecution case as revealed from the statement of the complainant and other witnesses, the offences as alleged are not made out. The learned counsel relied upon two statements given by the defacto complainant on 12.03.2020 and 13.03.2020 and pointed out that discrepancy in the two statements is clearly evident indicating the falsity of the prosecution case. It was further submitted that, if the trial is permitted to take place, the same would cause great prejudice and hence Section 482 Cr.P.C. ought to be invoked to quash the proceedings. oh ets BSR eer 2024/KER/2380 CRL.MC NO. 196 OF 2024 3 4. I have heard Sri.Noushad K.A., the learned Public Prosecutor as well. 5. The nature of allegations as evidenced from the final report is that the accused had assaulted the defacto complainant after hitting his bike with a motor car. Of course on 13.03.2020 it is noticed that the defacto complainant himself changed his stance and stated that he had not hit the bike with the car, but when the defacto complainant fell down he was assaulted. Anyway, considering the nature of allegations, it is evident that appreciation of evidence is essential to arrive at a conclusion. Exercise of the inherent powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. ought to be resorted to only in cases where the admitted allegations do not make out any of the offences alleged. 6. In the instant case, the allegations in final report indicate the commission of offence. Whether those allegations are true or not are all matters of trial. Therefore, I find that this is a case which requires appreciation of evidence and the remedy under Section 482 Cr.P.C.cannot be invoked. Hence, this Crl.M.C. is dismissed.
