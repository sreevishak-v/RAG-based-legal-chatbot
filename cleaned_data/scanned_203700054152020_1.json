R2 BY ADV. AMRUTHA P S OTHER PRESENT: SR.PP.C.S.HRITHWIK THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 08.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: oe . Crl.MC.No.5415 OF 2020 (F) iQ. 202 UKER/T331 ORDER Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.799/2017 registered at the Ernakulam Rural Police Station for offences punishable under Sections 341, 324, 294(b), 323 and 34 of IPC, now pending as C.C.No.20/2018 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kolenchery. The de facto complainant, at whose instance the crime was registered, is arrayed as the 2 respondent. Annexure-III affidavit has been filed by 2 respondent stating that the dispute, which was the reason for the incident and registration of the crime, has been resolved amicably and he has no subsisting grievance against the petitioners. 2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also, who, on instructions, submits that the petitioners have no criminal antecedents. De . Crl.MC.No.5415 OF 2020 (F) ..3.. 2021/KER/1331 3. Having considered the gravity of the offences alleged, nature of the injury caused and having perused the affidavit filed by the 2 respondent, the contents of which are submitted to be true and voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled and no public interest is involved in this matter. Moreover, in view of the _ settlement, possibility of the criminal proceedings ending in conviction is remote. As such, continuance of the proceedings will amount to an abuse of process of court and hence, in view of the legal position set out by the Honourable Supreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and Pete ee Crl1.MC.No.5415 OF 2020(F) An, 202UKER/133I1 another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is no impediment in granting the relief sought. In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. The proceedings in C.C.No.20/2018 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kolenchery is quashed.
