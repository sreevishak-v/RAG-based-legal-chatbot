No.545/2025 (Crime No. 192/2025 of Balaramapuram Police Station ) Petitioner/Accused :- Anoop, S/o Anandakuttan, Divya Nivas, Puliyaramele, Parasuvaikkal PO, Parassuvaikkal Village, Neyyattinkara Taluk. By Advocates. S L Simon and Sachin L S RESPONDENTS:- 1. State of Kerala. 2. Station House Officer, Balaramapuram Police Station. By Public Prosecutor Dr T Geena Kumary This Crl.M.C. came up for hearing on 25/02/2025 and the court on 28-02-2025 passed the following : ORDER This is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail. 2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable under Sections 354 and 511 of 376 of Indian Penal Code, and Crime No. 192/2025 of Balaramapuram Police Station is registered against the petitioner as the accused. 3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- On 13.05.2019 Criminal M.C.No.545/2025 1/5 at about 11 a.m., in the hall room of the residence of the relative of the defacto complainant, situated at Kowdiyar, while the defacto complainant was lying in the settee for sleeping, the accused caught the settee using his both hands, and tried to lie over her, and attempted to commit rape upon her. 4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The Investigating Officer filed report opposing the anticipatory bail application. 5. Heard. Perused the records. 6. The only point to be considered is, whether an order of anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioner/ accused. 7. The Point:- The petitioner/accused is alleged to have made an attempt to commit rape upon the defacto complainant. 8. The petitioner submits that, the defacto complainant in this case is an accused in several cheating cases, involving criminal misappropriation, and is having active role in the death of her 24% year old daughter, which is pending investigation before Balaramapuram Police Station as Crime No. 154/2025, for the offence punishable u/s. 103(1) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. It is submitted that, there is no explanation in her statement for the delay of more than 5% years in giving statement to police. It is also submitted that, the defacto complainant is the wife of the petitioner's cousin brother, and at present, the defacto complainant is in inimical terms with the petitioner and his other relatives, and she has preferred another false complaint against her Criminal M.C.No.545/2025 2/5 husbands cousin brother Gireeshkumar, and an F.I.R. has been registered in the Balaramapuram Police Station as Crime No. 171/2025, and the same is also pending investigation. The petitioner has produced copy of the F.I.Rs. in Crime Nos. 159/2025, 174/2025 and 192/2025 of Balaramapuram Police Station, to substantiate his contentions. 9. The magnitude of the offence alleged is grave. However, it is seen that, the case against the petitioner is registered on the basis of the confession statement given by the defacto complainant, while she was in custody in another crime on allegation of commission of the murder of her second child. It is seen that the statement of the defacto complainant under Section 183 of BNSS is recorded in this case (Crime No. 192/2025 of Balaramapuram Police Station). The learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently argued that the defacto complainant herself being an accused in several criminal cases, her statements cannot be believed. Apparently, the defacto complainant was in custody in connection with Crime No. 159/2025 of Balaramapuram Police Station. The petitioners counsel also stated that the defacto complainant has also given a complaint against one Gireeshkumar alleging similar sexual offences. The petitioners counsel had produced the copy of the First Information Report in Crime No. 171/2025 of Balaramapuram Police Station. It is seen that the said crime was also registered, while she was in police custody in Crime No. 159/2025. The counsel for the petitioner also Criminal M.C.No.545/2025 3/5 contended that, the alleged attempt of rape by the petitioner occurred in the hall room of the house of the relative of the defacto complainant, where other two relatives are there at that time, and the story is unbelievable. The story narrated by the defacto complainant regarding the alleged attempt of rape is prima facie unbelievable. It is relevant to note here that, there was no complaint from the part of the defacto complainant for about five years till she was arrested in some other case and her statement was taken in that case. Whether the petitioner is involved in the offence alleged is a matter of evidence. It would be a travesty of justice, if the petitioner is put behind the bars, if actually no offence is committed by him. No criminal antecedents of the petitioner is brought to the notice of this court. 10. In view of my discussion above, it appears that there is no impediment in granting a pre-arrest bail to the petitioner. Considering all these aspects, it is found that this is a fit case where a pre-arrest bail can be granted to the petitioner. In the result, the petition is allowed on the following conditions:- (1) In the event of arrest, the petitioner/accused shall be released on bail on his executing bond for Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) with two solvent sureties for the like sum each to the satisfaction of the arresting officer/Investigating Officer, as the case may be. Criminal M.C.No.545/2025 4/5 (2) Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. on every Wednesday for a period of 3 (three) months or till the filing of the final report, whichever is earlier. (3) Petitioner shall also appear before the Investigating Officer as and when required. (4) Petitioner shall not leave State of Kerala, without getting permission from the jurisdictional court. (5) Petitioner shall not commit any offence while on bail. (6) Petitioner shall not attempt to contact the defacto complainant or any of the prosecution witnesses, directly or through any other person, or in any other way try to tamper with the evidence or influence any witnesses or other persons related to the investigation. In case of any violation of the above conditions or misuse of liberty, the prosecution or the defacto complainant is at liberty to approach jurisdictional court for cancellation of bail.
