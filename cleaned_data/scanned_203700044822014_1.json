KEMAL PASHA, J. ven sonee EMC NO.4482 Of 2014 cca Dated this the 8'\" day of January, 2018 ORDER Annexure-1 preliminary order passed by the Sub Divisional Magistrate's Court, Devikulam under Section 111 Cr.P.C. is under challenge. 2. As per the report of the Sub Inspector of Police, Nedumkandom, the petitioner was involved in Crime No.545/2014 of Nedumkandom Police Station and the said crime was registered for the offences under Sections 448 and 342 read with Sections 34 IPC and Section 118(d) of the Kerala Police Act. The case is presently pending as CC.521/2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Nedumkandom. 3. Over and above the aforesaid case, the petitioner Bue 2018/KER/707 Crl.M.C.4482/2014 5. is not involved in any other criminal case. Annexure-1 order is quite unnecessary and there was no reason for passing such an order. The learned Sub Divisional Magistrate had not applied his mind in the matter and the unnecessary proceedings under Section 107 Cr.P.C. has been initiated. Matters being so, Annexure-1 order and all further proceedings in it are liable to be quashed. In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-1 order and all further proceedings against the petitioner in it are quashed. Sd/- (B.KEMAL PASHA, JUDGE) aks/08/01 // True Copy // PS to Judge"
