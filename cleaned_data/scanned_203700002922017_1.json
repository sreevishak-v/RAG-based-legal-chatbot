Crl.M.C.No.292 of 2017 Dated this the 13 day of January, 2017 ORDER Petitioner herein is the 5\" accused in a proceeding arising from Crime No.237 of 2010 of Vazhakkad Police Station for offences punishable under sections 143, 147, 148, 450, 436, 427 r/ 149 of Indian Penal Code. 2. The matter was pending as S.C.No.375 of 2011 before the Additional Sessions Court, Adhoc-I, Manjeri. Pending the proceedings, Annexure-A2 order was issued by the Government permitting withdrawal of the case with the permission of the Court. Consequently, Annexure-A3 application was submitted by the Additional Public Prosecutor and by order in Crl.M.P.No.1504 of 2012 in the above sessions case, all the accused who faced the trial were discharged. Petitioner herein and the other accused who did not participate were left out. Case of the petitioner herein is now pending as L.P.No.94 of 2012 in C.P.No.44 of 2011. 3. Having considered the fact that Annexure-A4 judgment has become final and conclusive and the Government order produced as Annexure-A4 is in relation to the withdrawal of the case Plies P ine Bea 2017/KER/2062 Crl.M.C.292/17 2 as such, necessarily, it should enure to the benefit of the petitioner herein who also stood as accused, though had not participated in S.C.No.375 of 2011. Having regard to these facts, I feel that no purpose will be served by prosecuting the petitioner herein since all other main accused remain discharged. In the light of above, I am inclined to quash the criminal proceedings. In the result, Crl.M.C is allowed. All further proceedings arising from Crime No.237 of 2010 of Vazhakkad Police Station stand quashed. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS Judge Sbna/13/1/17 True Copy / P A to Judge"
