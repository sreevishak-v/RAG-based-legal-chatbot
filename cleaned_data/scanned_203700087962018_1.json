CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 08.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: rc Crl.MC.No. 8796 of 2018 2 2019IKERII66 ORDER The petitioner, defacto-complainant in C.C. No.345 of 2002 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-V, Thiruvananthapuram has approached this Court seeking for a direction to the court concerned to expedite the proceedings in the above case and to dispose it of within a time frame. 2. The case came up for admission on 20.12.2018 and this Court had directed the court concerned to report the present stage of the case. Accordingly, the said court had reported that the case was originally taken on file as C.C. No.164 of 1999. Accused Nos.4 and 5 were absconding at that point of time and therefore, the case against them was split up and refiled as C.C. No.345 of 2002. The trial against accused Nos.i to 3 were already over and they were convicted. The case records were submitted before the Court of Sessions, as Crl.R.P.No.225 of 2002 is pending consideration there. Thereafter, the records of the case were received back by the court on 25.05.2006 and incorporated with the case. But, certain relevant documents were found missing from the case bundle and earnest efforts are being taken to trace it out. It is reported by the court concerned that, for the reason, the trial in the case could not be proceeded with at an expeditious pa Crl.MC.No. 8796 of 2018 3 2019IKERII66 manner. It is reported by the court concerned that the trial could be proceeded with only when the missing documents are traced out. It is also reported by the Magistrate that the case stands posted to 15.02.2019. 3. The learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the marriage of the petitioner's daughter is scheduled after two months and his presence is required for accumulating funds for the marriage. In the event of the matter reported by the court concerned that necessary documents are missing, there is no meaning in directing the court to dispose it of in a time bound manner. However, direction is issued to the court concerned to take all earnest efforts to see that the documents are traced out and to proceed with the trial at the immediate possible opportunity. With the above directions, the Crl.M.C is disposed of.
