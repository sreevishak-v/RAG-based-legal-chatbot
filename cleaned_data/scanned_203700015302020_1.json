A.MOHAMMED SAVAD OTHER PRESENT: PP RENJITH T.R. THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 06.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Bitee Crl.MC.No.1530 OF 2020 (A) 3... 202 1/KERIT00 ORDER Dated this the 6th day of January 2021 Petitioners are accused Nos.1 to 5 and 7 in Crime No.3/2020 registered at the Eravipuram Police Station for offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 294(b), 506, 323, 324, 307 r/w 149 of IPC. The de facto complainant, at whose instance the crime was registered, is arrayed as the 3 respondent. Annexure-A3 affidavit has been filed by 3 respondent stating that the dispute, which was the reason for the incident and registration of the crime, has been resolved amicably and he has no subsisting grievance against the petitioners. 2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also, who, on instructions, submits that the petitioners have no criminal antecedents. Crl.MC.No.1530 OF 2020 (A) AL, 202 1/KERIT00 3. Having considered the gravity of the offences alleged, nature of the injury caused and having perused the affidavit filed by the 3 respondent, the contents of which are submitted to be true and voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled and no public interest is involved in this matter. Though, there is an allegation that the petitioners have committed offence under Section 307 of IPC, perusal of the wound certificate shows that the reason of the the injury was stated to a road traffic accident. In Annexure-A2 order, by which this Court had granted bail to the petitioners also observed that the petitioners had suffered a lacerated wound which coincides with the story of the injury being sustained in the road traffic accident. Moreover, in view of the settlement, possibility of the criminal proceedings ending in conviction is remote. As such, continuance Crl.MC.No.1530 OF 2020 (A) Be. amikeR70 of the proceedings will amount to an abuse of process of court and hence, in view of the legal position set out by the Honourable Supreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is no impediment in granting the relief sought. In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. Annexure- Al FIR and the proceedings in Crime No.3/2020 registered at the Eravipuram Police Station is quashed. Sd/- V.G.ARUN SB/06/01/2020 JUDGE ese ce | Soa 4!
