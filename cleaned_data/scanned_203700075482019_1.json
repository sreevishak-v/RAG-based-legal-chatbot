The parent case was taken on file by the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Mannarkkad as CC No.1195/2014. The trial proceeded and both of them were found not guilty and acquitted under Section 248(1) of Cr.P.C. The case against the 3 accused was split up and refiled as CC No.456/2017 as he was absconding. The petitioner now approached this Court with a prayer to quash the proceedings against him in view of the acquittal of the co-accused. 2.

The judgment has now become final. No purpose will be served by proceeding with the trial against the petitioner.
