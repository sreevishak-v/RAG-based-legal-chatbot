The allegation is that by tapping electricity from consumer connection No.271 of Chelakara section, which is a domestic connection, petitioner committed theft of electricity for industrial purpose and thereby the Board sustained a loss of Rs.19,376/-. A complaint was filed by the Assistant Engineer before the Police on which crime No.624/2012 was registered by the Police. It is the case of the petitioner that thereafter the bill for the above referred amount was cancelled by the Deputy Chief Engineer in an appellate proceeding and further the case is that when the allegation of loss of Rs.19.376/- goes, a complaint will not lie. 2017/KER/1800 Crl.M.C.No.5121/2013 2 2.
