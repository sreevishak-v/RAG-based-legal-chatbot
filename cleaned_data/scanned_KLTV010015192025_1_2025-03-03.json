No.645/2025 (Crime No. 183/2025 of Aryancode Police Station) Petitioner/Accused :- Johndrose, aged 75 years, S/o George Nadar, residing at Karunya, Thannimoodu, Thalanira, Chemboor, Ottasekharamangalam P.O, Keezharoor Village, Thiruvananthapuram District By Advocate:-S. Murukan Counter Petitioners:- 1. State of Kerala 2. The Station House Officer, Aryancodu Police Station By Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumary This petition came up for hearing on 01/03/2025 and the court on 03/03/2025 passed the following : ORDER This is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail. Criminal M.C.No.645/2025 1/5 2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable under Sections 74, 79, 115(2), 296(b), 329(3) and 351(2) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, and Crime No. 183/2025 of Aryancode Police Station is registered against the petitioner, arraying him as the accused. 3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- On 16.02.2025 at about 4.p.m., the accused trespassed into the property of the father of the defacto complainant, situated at Thannimoodu, uttered abusive words against her and threatened her with fear of death. Thereafter, the accused tore the nighty worn by the defacto complainant and showed his nudity by lifting his dhothi, and fisted on her back. 4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The Investigating Officer filed report opposing the anticipatory bail application. 5. Heard. Perused the records. 6. The only point to be considered is, whether an order of anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioner/accused. 7. The Point:- The petitioner/accused and the defacto complainant are neighbours. The petitioner/accused is alleged to have trespassed into the property Criminal M.C.No.645/2025 2/5 of the father of the defacto complainant, abused the defacto complainant, attacked her, tore her nighty and showed his nudity. The motive of the alleged attack is the animosity out of the property dispute. 8. According to the petitioner, he is absolutely innocent of the allegations levelled against him and no such incident has happened as alleged by the prosecution. It is submitted that, the petitioner and the defacto complainant are neighbours and known to each other for the last 30 years, and the petitioner is conducting an ayurvedic shop near his house. It is also submitted that, there was some property dispute between the defacto complainant and the petitioner, and he filed a suit as O.S.No. 810/2024 before the Principal Munsiff Court, Neyyattinkara, and an injunction was granted in that suit restraining the father of the defacto complainant from trespassing into his property, and in order to wreck vengeance, the defacto complainant has falsely foisted the present case against the petitioner. 9. There is no serious allegation as against the petitioner. Apparently, civil dispute is pending between the petitioner and the father of the defacto complainant. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that, O.S.No. 810/2024, which is an injunction suit filed by the petitioner as against the father of Criminal M.C.No.645/2025 3/5 the defacto complainant was pending before the Principal Munsiff Court, Neyyattinkara, and that the petitioner had obtained an injunction order as against the father of the defacto complainant and in order to wreck vengeance in view of the same, this case is falsely foisted against the petitioner. In view of the civil suit, an element of fabrication or exaggeration of the case cannot be ruled out. The petitioner is an age old man. It would be a travesty of justice, if the petitioner is put behind the bars, if actually no offence was committed by him. No criminal antecedents of the petitioner is brought to the notice of this court. 10. In view of my discussion above, it appears that there is no impediment in granting a pre-arrest bail to the petitioner. Considering all these aspects, it is found that this is a fit case where a pre-arrest bail can be granted to the petitioner. In the result, the petition is allowed on the following conditions:- (1) In the event of arrest, the petitioner/ accused shall be released on bail on her executing bond for Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) with two solvent sureties for the like sum each to the satisfaction of the arresting officer/Investigating Officer, as the case may be. (2) Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer between 10 a.m. and 11 am. on every Wednesday for a Criminal M.C.No.645/2025 4/5 period of 3 (three) months or till the filing of the final report, whichever is earlier. (3) Petitioner shall also appear before the Investigating Officer as and when required. (4) Petitioner shall not commit any offence while on bail. (5) Petitioner shall not attempt to contact the defacto complainant or any of the prosecution witnesses, directly or through any other person, or in any other way try to tamper with the evidence or influence any witnesses or other persons related to the investigation. In case of any violation of the above conditions or misuse of liberty, the prosecution or the defacto complainant is at liberty to approach jurisdictional court for cancellation of bail.
