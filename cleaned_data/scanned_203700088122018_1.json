CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 07.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Crl.MC.No. 8812 of 2018 2 201KERITOS ORDER This petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (the Code for brevity). 2. The 2 respondent is the de facto complainant in C.C.No.1165 of 2017 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class-III, Kollam. The 1* petitioner is the husband and the petitioners 2 and 3 are his parents. They are being proceeded against for having committed offence punishable under Section 498A r/w. Section 34 of the IPC. 3. The instant proceeding is initiated with a prayer to quash the proceedings on the ground of settlement of all disputes. The 2\" respondent has filed an affidavit stating that she does not wish to continue with the prosecution proceedings against the petitioners. 4. The learned Public Prosecutor has obtained instructions. He submits that the statement of the 2\"? respondent has been recorded and the State has no objection in terminating the proceedings as it involves no public interest. Crl.MC.No. 8812 of 2018 3 201KERITOS 5. I have considered the submissions advanced. 6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303] and in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466], the Apex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. Further in Jitendra Raghuvanshi & Others v. Babita Raghuvanshi & Another [(2013) 4 SCC 58], it was observed that it is the duty of the courts to encourage genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes. If the parties ponder over their faults and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual agreement instead of fighting it out in a court of law, the courts should not hesitate to exercise its powers under Section 482 of the Code. Permitting such proceedings to continue would be nothing, but an abuse of process of court. The interest of justice also require that the proceedings be quashed. Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I am of the considered view that this Court will be well justified in invoking its extra ordinary powers under Section 482 of the Code to quash the proceedings. In the result, this petition will stand allowed. Baers Crl.MC.No. 8812 of 2018 4 2019/KER/705 Annexure-A final report and all proceedings pursuant thereto against the petitioners now pending as C.C.No.1165 of 2017 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-III, Kollam are quashed.
