CrL.M.C.No. 6822 of 2016 Dated this the 11\" day of January, 2017 ORDER The petitioner herein is arrayed as accused No.2 in SC No.94/2012 of the Addl.Sessions Court No.IV, Palakkad for offences punishable under Section 55 (a) of the Abkari Act. 2. On 17/4/2010, the Excise Party intercepted the first accused who was found to have been concealing spirit. Crime was registered against the first accused. The petitioner herein was also included in the array of the accused on the basis of the statement given by the first accused that it was the second accused who had supplied the spirit. 3. Contending that, apart from the alleged confession statement of the co-accused , there is no other material to connect the petitioner herein with the crime and that the alleged confession will not stand in the eye of law, the petitioner seeks to quash the proceedings. 4. Learned Public Prosecutor also, with reference to the available materials, fairly admitted that the only material relied on by the prosecution is the confession of the first accused. 5. It is settled by the various decisions that co-accused cannot be roped in with the aid of the statement of the other accused. el 2017/KER/1512 Cri.M.C.BNo.6822/2016 2. Learned counsel for the petitioner further relied on Annexure C and D judgments wherein relying on the decision reported in Lissy Kurian v. State of Kerarla [2004 (1) KLJ 877), this Court has held that confession of co-accused cannot be by itself the sole basis for implication. 6. I am satisfied that the above decision is squarely applicable to the the facts of this case. In the light of the above, the successful prosecution against the petitioner herein on the basis of the available materials may not be legally sustainable. In the light of the above, I am inclined to allow the Crl.M.C. In the result, Crl.M.C.is allowed. All further proceedings in relation to the petitioner herein pursuant to Annexure-B final report of the Addl.Sessions Court No.IV, Palakkad stand quashed.
