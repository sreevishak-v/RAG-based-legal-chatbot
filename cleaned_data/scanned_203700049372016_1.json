Petitioner herein stands arrayed as the accused in C.C.No.2692 of 2016 of N.I. Special Court, Kochi for offence punishable under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. 4. Petitioner herein was issued with summons for appearance. She failed to appear before the court below and consequently, warrant was issued to her. Petitioner contends that summons was not served on her. Petitioner submits that she is ready and willing to surrender before the jurisdiction of the court below and to seek bail. However, only apprehension of the petitioner is that in the event of she surrendering before the learned magistrate, bail application is not likely to be considered on the same day and she is likely to be remanded. 5, Having regard to the apprehension of the petitioner herein, I am inclined to dispose of the petition with a direction that in the event of the petitioner herein surrendering before the learned BIE h Rec red Elz a aH 2016/KER/33895 Cri.M.C.4937/16 2 magistrate and filing an application for bail, it shall be considered by the learned magistrate on the same day itself, having regard to the nature of contentions and all attending circumstances.
