No.2496 of 2015 Dated this the 21* day of April, 2015. ORDER The petitioner is the accused in Crime No.14 of 2004 registered by the Excise Range Office, Kodungalloor under Sections 59(a) and 58 (g) of the Abkari Act. It is submitted that the court below has already granted bail to the petitioner. But, unfortunately thereafter, the petitioner went abroad seeking employment and now he is employed outside the State of Kerala. On account of the above reason, he was unable to attend the court, when the matter was taken up for consideration. In the absence of the petitioner, the case was split up and renumbered as C.P.No.33 of 2007 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kodungalloor, which was latter forwarded to the First Additional Sessions Court, Thrissur and later, the same was registered as S.C.No.204 of 2008 which is pending before the First Additional Sessions Court. Stes ene 2015/KER/17262 Cri.M.C. No.2496 of 2015 -~2- 2. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that now he is ready to surrender before the court below and to seek regular bail. Apprehension of the petitioner is that as per the practice followed by the learned Magistrate, if he surrenders before the court below, he will be remanded to the Judicial Custody, pending consideration of the bail application. The learned counsel for the petitioner urged for a direction to the court below for considering the bail application on the date of appearance. 3. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also. I do not think that the Learned Magistrate will remand the accused mechanically without application of mind. However, to secure the interest of justice, the court below is directed to consider the application for bail on the date of appearance itself. Sd/- K. HARILAL JUDGE 2015/KER/17262 Cri.M.C. No.2496 of 2015 ~3- Scl."
