The offences alleged against the petitioner include Section 308 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and under the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984. 2. According to Smt.Anakha Babu, the learned counsel for the petitioner, though bail was taken by the petitioner at the crime stage, subsequently he had not received summons from the Magistrate's Court and therefore he was unaware about the pendency of the proceedings. Without serving summons on the petitioner, non-bailable warrant has been issued for his failure to appear before the Magistrate's court. It was submitted that the petitioner went abroad immediately after taking bail and therefore there is no possibility of having served summons on him. 3. I have heard Smt.Sreeja V., the learned Public Prosecutor as well. 4. Having regard to the circumstances of the case especially since the petitioner alleges that he had never been served with summons and taking note of the proposed wedding of the petitioner on 28.01.2024, I am of the view that a direction can be issued to consider the application Es eeyed Ed] ib eet 2024/KER/2265 CRL.MC NO. 311 OF 2024 3 for recall of warrant and for grant of bail on the same day itself. In view of the above, there will be a direction to the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Ambalappuzha to consider the application for bail and the application for recall of warrant, if any filed by the petitioner in C.P.No.27 of 2023, on the same day itself provided the petitioner files such applications on or before 22.01.2024. The Cri.M.C.is disposed of as above.
