CrL.M.C.No. 5894 of 2017 Dated this the 8\" day of January, 2018 ORDER The petitioners were arrayed as the accused in CC No.1257/2016 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kakkanad. 2. The first respondent herein, who is the defacto complainant before the court below, filed an application under section 91 of Cr.P.C.for a direction to the first accused, the Managing Partner of the partnership firm,to produce the partnership deed, audit report and an agreement dated 28/4/2016 on an allegation that the first accused was in possession of the above three documents. The first accused did not chose to file objections to the above application. Hence, the court below by Annexure A3 order directed the first accused to produce the partnership deed, audit report and also the agreement dated 28/5/2016 within a period of three weeks from today. This is under challenge in this Crl.M.C. 3. Though several arguments were advanced by the learned counsel for the first accused, I am not inclined to accept those af aes 2018/KER/709 Crl.M.C.No.5894/2017 2 contentions. However, learned counsel for the first accused contended that the first accused was not in possession of the above documents. If that be so, the first accused will be free to file an affidavit before the court below at the earliest, on or before the next posting date, affirming the above fact. Thereupon, the defacto complainant will be free to let in other evidence to substantiate the contentions. Crl.M.C.is accordingly disposed of. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS Judge dpk /true copy/ PS to Judge."
