Petitioner is the accused in S.C.No.41 of 2018 on the file of the Add. Sessions Court-II, Kalpetta. He was granted bail during the investigation on condition that he shall surrender his passport. Accordingly, he has surrendered his passport in the committal court. He filed an application in the trial court to return the passport. So that he may renew it by Annexure-III order. The trail court has dismissed it on the ground that the passport was not surrendered in that court. After hearing both sides, I am satisfied that a direction may be issued to the Sessions Court to return the passport so that the petitioner may renew it and surrender it within ten days of its delivery to him.
