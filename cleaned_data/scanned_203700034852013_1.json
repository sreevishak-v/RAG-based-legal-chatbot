TO JUDGE Mn Biwkeas 2015/KER/1050 K. ABRAHAM MATHEW, J. \" CrLM.C.No.3485 of 2013 _ Dated this the 9\" day of January, 2015 ORDER The petitioner who is the accused in crime No.528/2013 of the Mattanchery police station wants to quash the proceedings in it. The allegation against him is that he obtained the consent of the additional second respondent by making a false representation that he would marry her and he had sexual intercourse with her and he has now refused to marry her and has thus committed the offence under Section 376 IPC. 2. There has been no representation for the petitioner. Heard the learned counsel for the additional second respondent and the learned Public Prosecutor. 3. The prayer is to quash the FIR. It is submitted that final report has already been filed. 4. The proceedings are sought to be quashed on different grounds. The first is that no offence is made out. Though the trial court has already framed the charge it is Dy oe ets a 2015/KER/1050 Crl.M.C.No.3485 of 2013 -2- not challenged in this proceedings. 5. It is stated in the petition that the matter has been settled between the parties. This is opposed by the second respondent, who is the victim in the case. More over, the offence is non-compoundable. The court cannot take notice of the agreement between the parties. 6. Thus, in any view of the matter, this is not a fit case to favour the petitioner with an order under Section 482 Cr.P.C. In the result, this Crl.M.C. is dismissed. Sd/- K. ABRAHAM MATHEW JUDGE /fTrue copy// P.A. TO JUDGE shg/"
