CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 09.01.2020, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Crl.M.C.No. 4208 of 2019 > 2020/KER/1012 ORDER Dated this the 9th day of January 2020 The petitioner is the 1** accused in C.C.No.467/2012 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kochi. There were two accused. The 272 accused had approached this Court in Crl.M.C.No.5542/2014 to quash the proceedings against him in the very same case. The complaint filed by the 1s* respondent was referred by the Police, against which he filed a protest complaint and that has been taken on file by the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kochi and is presently pending as C.C.No.467/2012. The allegation in the complaint is that the 2\" accused had under the instigation of the 1% accused; forged and produced a document before the Cochin Devaswom Board to lay a claim over the Temple. After considering the entire materials available, this Court by a detailed Order dated 07.06.2019 at Annexure X quashed the proceedings as against the 2\"? accused. The offences alleged against the petitioner are under Sections 415, : Crl.M.C.No. 4208 of 2019 3 2020/KER/1012 465, 468 and 474 of I.P.C. There is also a civil suit pending against the 2 accused. The dispute revolves around the title over the Temple and its properties. The discussions in Annexure X order would equally apply to the petitioner also, because the specific allegation therein is that in furtherance of common intention the accused 1 and 2 had forged documents to usurp the title over the Temple. In view of the specific finding in favour of the 27 accused, the allegations as against the 1** accused also would not lie as the role of the 1** accused is only to instigate the 2\" accused to produce the forged document. Therefore, the entire proceedings aS against the 1% accused in C.C.No.467/2012 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kochi, also stands quashed under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. and the petitioner is discharged.
