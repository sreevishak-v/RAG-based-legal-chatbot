Now the case is pending as C.C.No.271/2009 before the said court. The petitioners' case is as follows : The first petitioner availed a loan from the complainant bank to purchase an excavator. Now, the amount due is Rs.7,00,000/-. When the petitioner defaulted instalments, the above said complaint is filed alleging that the excavator was transferred to the second petitioner and also that material alterations are made on the vehicle. Thereafter, the second petitioner appeared before the court and stated by an affidavit that he had not purchased the vehicle and he got no right over the vehicle. It is also the case of the petitioner that the loan amount has been repaid. Notice issued to the complainant who is shown as Le 2017/KER/2075 Crl.M.C.No.3342/2013 2 respondent No.2 before this court. No representation for the said bank for today before this court. There is nothing to disbelieve the case of the petitioner that the above said Rs.7,00,000/- was repaid. 2. The only question before this court is that whether there is ingredients to attract an offence under Section 420 of IPC. It can be seen that the bank got no case that at the time of availing the loan itself, the petitioner was having criminal intention to cheat the bank and avail Rs.7,00,000/- and thereafter not to repay the amount. It appears that the grievance was that the vehicle was transferred to the second petitioner and thereafter repayments were defaulted. When the ingredients of an offence under Section 420 is lacking, there will be no necessity to proceed with a case like this. Admittedly, the complainant is a financial institution which is advancing amounts to the persons requesting and entitled for the same. There is no case that any forged document was produced or false representation was made so as to avail the loan. In the charge sheet also, it is stated as follows : 1-)0 mvoesi] moeme2oow! e0ef GM0AH] AIQAM aHOGMIds)Bo Bleha ell ao 2017/KER/2075 Crl.M.C.No.3342/2013 3 aloendlasgemss HDFC sisal MIM}o Gales oGyS}OO AM MAGAIQS aHM AloUsMdl GabeMlaw@o MINIM Mem 1-)0 (a 1Oy1e6) AN@ajm MSGOZMOVNeM9 2-)0 (al@y16) a1068) MAAUMILN}MONEMD GAIGAD ENUIAIEGHD MA/WICWae) 1-)0 (eIMI@ae) 1-)0 MIdaMlaw AmMigleflaf al AaIgZIMolM} Galen) sniomlodo asadinmalenss TATA HITACHI agmaeaig 25.11.2008 MIMD] 2-)0 (21G10,A00!
