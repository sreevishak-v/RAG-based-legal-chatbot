HTRUE COPY// PA. TO JUDGE bp Bier) 2015/KER/17602 P. UBAID, J. Dated this the 5\" day of May, 2015 ORDER The petitioners herein are the original accused Nos.3,5,8,10 and 13 in C.C. No.951/2011 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-ll, Hosdurg. The offences involved in this case are under Sections 143,147,148,452,323 and 427 read with149 IPC. The original accused Nos.1,2,4,6,7,9,11,12 and 14 faced trial before the learned Magistrate, and obtained a judgment of acquittal on 02.03.2015 under Section 248(1) Cr.P.C., when all the material witnesses turned hostile to the prosecution in view of an amicable settlement made by the parties out of court. The prosecution examined twelve witnesses in the said case and marked Ext.P1. None of the material witnesses examined in the case supported the prosecution. In the absence of any evidence or incriminating circumstance, the learned Magistrate acquitted the accused Nos.1,2,4,6,7,9,11,12 and 14. The case against the petitioners herein was split up and refiled as C.C.280/2015. The petitioners now seek orders quashing the prosecution as against them on the ground that the very substratum of the prosecution case is nee) 2015/KER/17602 Cri.M.C. No.2670 of 2015 2 totally lost by the acquittal of the others, and continuance of prosecution against them will not serve any purpose. Annexure - A3 judgment in C.C.951/2011 shows that all the material witnesses examined by the prosecution in the said case turned hostile in view of an amicable settlement made by the parties out of court. In such a situation, it is quite definite that the prosecution cannot in any manner improve the case and the witnesses also cannot in any manner help the prosecution, if the case against the petitioners goes to trial. In short, such proceeding will be a sheer waste of time. In the result, this petition is allowed. The prosecution against the petitioners in C.C.280/2015 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-ll, Hosdurg will stand quashed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Accordingly, the petitioners will stand released from prosecution. Sd/- P. UBAID, JUDGE sd"
