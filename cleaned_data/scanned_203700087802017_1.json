RESPONDENT(S) EXHIBITS NIL R.AV HTRUE COPY!// PA TO JUDGE nee SUNIL THOMAS, J WE Crl.M.C.No.8780 of 2017 Dated this the 3\" day of January, 2018 ORDER The petitioners are arrayed as the accused Nos.1 and 2 in CC.No.640/2017 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Payyannur, arising from Crime No.126/2009 of Pazhayangadi Police Station for offences punishable under sections 143, 147, 448, 427 read with section 149 of the Indian Penal Code. 2. It was alleged by the prosecution that on 18.5.2009 at 10.15 pm, the petitioners formed into an unlawful assembly along with 10 other persons and trespassed into the office and demolished furnitures. Complaint was laid and crime was registered. After investigation, final report was laid and the matter was taken cognizance of as CC.No.568/2009. It appears that the third accused alone faced the trial. He was acquitted by Annexure-A3 judgment. The case against the petitioners herein was_ split up and _ *refiled as CC.No.640/2017. nee 2018/KER/48 Crl.M.C.No.8780 of 2017 2 3. The petitioners have approached this court contending that in the light of the acquittal of the co- accused, the substratum of the case is broken and the prosecution of the petitioner is not sustainable. It was also contended that the dispute has now been settled with the defacto complainant. To substantiate it, the learned counsel for the petitioners relied on Annexure-A4, which is stated to be affirmed by the defacto complainant, who is arrayed as the second respondent. The learned counsel for the second respondent submitted that the matter has been settled and he has no objection in quashing the proceedings. The learned Public prosecutor on instructions submitted that Annexure-A3 judgment was not challenged in any other proceedings and that the petitioners are not involved in any other case. Evidently, Annexure-A3 judgment has become final. A perusal of the judgment shows that the court, after evaluation of the available materials acquitted the third accused. 4. Hence, there is no scope for a _ successful nee 2018/KER/48 Crl.M.C.No.8780 of 2017 3 prosecution of the petitioners herein. Evidently the parties have also settled the dispute. They are not involved in any other crime. Having considered these facts, I feel that the interest of justice demands the quashing of the entire proceedings. Hence Crl.M.C is liable to be allowed. 5. However, it is pertinent to note that though the crime is of the year 2009, the petitioners herein remained elusive and did not participate in the judicial proceedings. The case against them was split up and refiled. This has caused considerable delay in the judicial proceedings. Having considered this, I am inclined to invoke the jurisdiction under section 482 Cr.P.C only subject to payment of cost by each of the petitioner. Hence Crl.M.C will stand allowed and all further proceedings in CC.No.640/2017 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Payyannur arising from Crime No.126/2009 of Pazhayangadi Police Station as against the petitioners herein will stand quashed on condition that BLsRnl 2018/KER/48 Crl.M.C.No.8780 of 2017 4 each of the petitioner deposits a sum of Rs.1500/- to the Kerala State Mediation and Conciliation Committee, High Court of Kerala, Ernakulam, within one month from today and produce proof, before this court.
