R3-4 BY ADV. SHRI.ANSU VARGHESE OTHER PRESENT: PP T.R.RENJITH THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 07.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Crl.MC.No.5722 OF 2020 (E) Be. 202 1/KER/TI26 ORDER Dated this the 7th day of January 2021 Petitioners are the accused in Crime No.610/2013 registered at the Pathanamthitta Police Station for the offence punishable under Section 13 r/w 8.17 of the Kerala Money Lenders Act, now pending as C.C.No1149/2013 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Pathanamthitta. The de facto complainant and the other aggrieved person are arrayed as respondents 3 and 4. Annexures-A2 and A3 affidavits have been filed by the said respondents stating that the dispute, which was the reason for the incident and registration of the crime, has been resolved amicably and they have no subsisting grievance against the iene Crl.MC.No.5722 OF 2020 (E) AL, 202 1/KER/TI26 petitioners. 2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also, who, on instructions, submits that the petitioners have no criminal antecedents. 3. Having considered the gravity of the offences alleged, nature of the injury caused and having perused the affidavits filed by respondents 3 and 4, the contents of which are submitted to be true and voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled and no public interest is involved in this matter. Moreover, in view of the settlement, possibility of the criminal proceedings ending in conviction is remote. As such, continuance of the proceedings will amount to an abuse of process of court and hence, in view of the legal position set out by the Honourable Supreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh v. State of Disgreree a [esse Crl.MC.No.5722 OF 2020(E 5. 202 1/KER/TI26 Punjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is no impediment in granting the relief sought. In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. The proceedings in C.C.No1149/2013 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Pathanamthitta is quashed.
