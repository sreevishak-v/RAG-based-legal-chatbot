RESPONDENT'S ANNEXURES:- NIL. HTRUE COPY// P.S. TO JUDGE rs sae ee oe a lee 2016/KER/33666 RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.Y, J Dated this the 1* day of August, 2016 ORDER i.The petitioners are accused Nos.1 to 4 in C.C. No.1453 of 2015 on the file of the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Ernakulam. They have been charged for having committed offences punishable under sections 341, 323, 326 read with 34 of the IPC. 2. The 24 respondent is the de facto complainant and the son-in-law of the 1st petitioner herein. It appears that there were matrimonial disputes between the 2nd respondent and Archana, the daughter of the 1s petitioner. The prosecution allegation is that on 10.5.2012 at 12.00 noon, the petitioners had assaulted the de facto complainant causing injuries. 3.Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners, 2.4 respondent as well as the learned Public Prosecutor. sae ee oe a DO1GIKERIS3666 Crl.M.C.4506/2016 2 4.It is submitted by the learned counsel that the disputes between the 2.4 respondent and Archana, the daughter of the ist petitioner, has been settled amicably and the marriage has also been dissolved by a decree of divorce. Referring to Annexure-A4 affidavit filed by the 2\" respondent it is submitted that the 2 respondent has asserted that he does not wish or intend to continue the criminal proceedings against the petitioners any further. 5.The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submits that the petitioners are not persons with criminal antecedents. 6.It is thus borne out from the submissions made at the bar that the parties have amicably settled their disputes by their own free will and without any kind of pressure, influence or coercion. The compromise, it is felt, is voluntarily and genuine and can be acted upon. 7.In_ Gian Singh v. State of Punjab (2012) 10 SCC 303), Apex Court has held that in appropriate cases, the sae ee oe a DO1GIKERIS3666 Crl.M.C.4506/2016 3 High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. This view was reiterated in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab. (2014) 6 SCC 466) and Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State of Jharkhand and Another 2014 (9) SCC 653 . 8.After having heard the submissions of the learned Counsel and on perusing the records, it appears that the offences are entirely personal in nature and do not affect public peace or tranquility. It is also felt that quashing of proceedings on account of compromise would bring about peace. In a case such as the instant one, even if the prosecution is allowed to continue, it would not serve any purpose as the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak. It can only result in putting the de _ facto complainant and the accused to unwanted oppression and prejudice. Settlement will augur well for the interest of the community and will enable the parties to live in peace Bearer S BIR 2016/KER/33666 Crl.M.C.4506/2016 4 and harmony. In the result, this petition is allowed. All further proceedings against the petitioners, who are accused Nos.i to 4 in C.C. No.1453 of 2015 on the file of the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Ernakulam, shall stand quashed. Sd/- RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.V. JUDGE vps"
