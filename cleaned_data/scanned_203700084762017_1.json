RESPONDENTS ' EXHIBITS : NIL /TRUE COPY/ P. A. TO JUDGE Pn 2018/KER/257 SUNIL THOMAS, J. Dated this the 4\" day of January, 2018 ORDER The petitioner is the sole accused in Crime No.1041/2017 of Pattanakad Police Station, Alappuzha District for offences punishable under Sections 323 & 341 of IPC. It is alleged by the prosecution that due to previous enmity, on 23.09.2017 at 3.00 p.m., the petitioner herein pushed down the de facto complainant and kicked her. When the daughter intervened, she was also pushed down. Alleging the offences committed, complaint was laid and FIR was registered. Annexure Al is the FIR in the above crime. 2. The petitioner has approached this Court contending that pending the investigation parties, who are neighbours, have settled their disputes. To buttress the above contention, learned counsel for the petitioner relied on Annexures A2 and A3 affidavits allegedly affirmed by respondents 2 and 3, who are the de facto complainant and the injured. Learned counsel for the respondents 2 and 3 acknowledged the due execution of the above affidavits and reiterated the settlement arrived at between the parties. 2018/KER/257 Cri. M. C. No. 8476 of 2017 2 3. The learned Public Prosecutor endorsed the settlement arrived at between the parties and stated that the statement of one of the respondent has been recorded. 4. There is nothing on record to show that the petitioner is involved in any other crime. Essentially, the dispute arose from a property dispute. Having considered these facts, | am inclined to invoke the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. treating the dispute as a purely personal one, without involvement of any larger question of public importance. Hence, Crl.M.C. is allowed. All further proceedings in Crime No.1041/2017 of Pattanakad Police Station, Alappuzha District stand quashed. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE. Pn"
