Criminal M.C.No.611/2025 1/6 3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- The accused, who was the staff of D.V.Finance, an institution run by the defacto complainant, with an intention to obtain wrongful gain and to cause wrongful loss to the defacto complainant, during the period from 12.09.2022 to 01.02.2025, made forged entries showing that 71 customers pledged their gold ornaments and availed a total sum of Rs.31,77,976/- towards gold loans, and obtained the balance amount of Rs.1,96,722/- kept in the institution, and thus obtained a total sum of Rs.33,74,698/- from the institution. 4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The Investigating Officer filed report opposing the anticipatory bail application. 5. Heard. Perused the records. 6. The only point to be considered is, whether an order of anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioner/ accused. 7. The Point:- The defacto complainant is the Proprietor of an institution by name D.V.Finance, situated at Charottukonam. The petitioner/ accused was the staff of the said institution. It is alleged that, the petitioner/accused, during the period from 12.09.2022 to 01.02.2025, made forged entries in the register showing that they allotted a total sum of Rs.31,77,976/- towards gold loans to 71 persons, and _ she obtained Rs.1,96,722/-, which was kept in the institution, and thus obtained a total sum of Criminal M.C.No.611/2025 2/6 Rs.33,74,698/- from the institution, and thereby cheated the defacto complainant. 8. The petitioner submits that, she was working as a Clerk in the Devaram Kurries Private Limited, Plamoottukada, since 22.11.2006, and on 14.09.2022, she had joined in the Charottukonam Branch, and one Vijayan D., the Managing Director of the said firm had filed a petition to the Station House Officer, Pozhiyoor Police Station alleging that the petitioner had committed financial misappropriation while she was working in the said institution. It is submitted that, the actual fact is that, in December 2024, the petitioner informed the Managing Director of Devaram Kurries that, she is going to resign from her job because of some illness and she had made a claim of Rs.4,32,000/- towards her provident fund benefits. It is also submitted that, the petitioner resigned from D.V.Finance on 01.02.2025, and thereafter, in order to evade from the payment of the provident fund benefits, the said Vijayan had fabricated a story against the petitioner, and by influencing the Pozhiyoor Police, he is trying to implicate the petitioner in this case. The defacto complainant also filed a complaint against one Tharakumari, who was the staff of the institution, for the above said reasons. The petitioner is suffering from various diseases. The petitioner produced the copies of the medical records and copy of screen shot of text message from South Indian Bank, to substantiate her contentions. Criminal M.C.No.611/2025 3/6 9. There is serious allegation as against the petitioner. Going by the First Information Statement given by the defacto complainant, it is seen that, while working with D.V.Finance Company, the petitioner had cheated the defacto complainant by fraudulently entering in the register that the customers had pledged the gold ornaments and appropriating the money given by the Company for her own purpose. It is also stated in the First Information Statement that the Day Book Register and Gold Pledging Register were maintained and the misappropriation was traced out when the petitioner asked for advance amount to be paid to the customer and on verification of the Gold Pledge Register, the defacto complainant came to know of the misappropriation. The contention of the petitioner is that she was only a Clerk in that institution and that the Managing Director was the custodian of the locker, and the cash and gold locker were not handled by the petitioner. It is also stated by the petitioner that regular audits were conducted by the officials of the company and if at all any financial misappropriation is noticed, it would have been revealed in audit reports. Apparently, the prosecution has not brought out any materials to show the commission of the offence by the petitioner. In the report submitted by the Investigating Officer, nothing is stated relating to the seizure of any documents, at least the so called Gold Pledge Register or Day Book Register. Even in the First Information Statement given by the defacto complainant, there is no clarity as to the functioning of the Criminal M.C.No.611/2025 4/6 institution and how the petitioner had cheated the defacto complainant. It is not clear whether without verification of the pledged gold, any amount was advanced by the company. Significantly, the petitioner is only the Clerk of the institution and nothing is stated in the First Information Statement why the activities of the petitioner is not managed by the superior officers or by way of audit for such a long period. The prosecution has not made out a prima facie case as against the petitioner. It would be a travesty of justice, if the petitioner is put behind the bars, if she has not committed any offence. No criminal antecedents of the petitioner is brought to the notice of this court. 10. In view of my discussion above, it appears that there is no impediment in granting a pre-arrest bail to the petitioner. Considering all these aspects, it is found that this is a fit case where a pre-arrest bail can be granted to the petitioner. In the result, the petition is allowed on the following conditions:- (1) In the event of arrest, the petitioner/ accused shall be released on bail on her executing bond for Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) with two solvent sureties for the like sum each to the satisfaction of the arresting officer/Investigating Officer, as the case may be. (2) Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. on every Wednesday for a period of 3 (three) months or till the filing of the final report, whichever is earlier. Criminal M.C.No.611/2025 5/6 (3) Petitioner shall also appear before the Investigating Officer as and when required. (4) Petitioner shall not commit any offence while on bail. (5) Petitioner shall not attempt to contact the defacto complainant or any of the prosecution witnesses, directly or through any other person, or in any other way try to tamper with the evidence or influence any witnesses or other persons related to the investigation. (6) Even when the petitioner is on anticipatory bail, the petitioner will be deemed to be in custody for the purpose of effecting any recovery, etc., as held by the Honble Supreme Court in Sushila Agarwal and Others v. State (2020 ICO 108). In case of any violation of the above conditions or misuse of liberty, the prosecution or the defacto complainant is at liberty to approach jurisdictional court for cancellation of bail.
