Dated this the 5\" day of January, 2018 ORDER Petitioners are the accused Nos.1 to 4 and 6 to 14 in C.C.No.78/2016 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Koyilandy for the offences under Section 500 read with 34 IPC. 2. The 2 respondent preferred a private complaint before the court below alleging the offence punishable under Section 500 IPC read with 34 IPC against the 1* petitioner Nazeera aged 22 years and 13 other persons, who are her relatives. 3. There was a marriage proposal by the 2\" respondent to the 1* petitioner herein. Discussions were made and the marriage was fixed. Wedding cards were printed. Subsequently, prior to the marriage, the father and mother of the 1* petitioner met with an accident and died on the spot. 4. The other relatives of the 1* petitioner were not favouring the marriage of the i petitioner with the 27 respondent. A meeting was arranged by the parties before the Khasi. In the presence of the 'Khasi', it seems that the ee 2018/KER/495 Crl.M.C.No.6773 of 2016 2 relatives of the 1* petitioner divulged the reason for which they wanted to withdraw the proposal. It is alleged that they had told the 'Khasi' that the 2\" respondent is a drunkard and a drug addict. According to the 2 respondent, through the said words the accused have defamed him. 5. It seems that it was in a private meeting arranged by the parties in the presence of the 'Khasi', the accused were forced to divulge the reason as to why they wanted to withdraw from the marriage proposal. At any stretch of imagination, it will not invite an offence under Section 500 IPC. Therefore, all further proceedings in C.C.No.78/2016 are liable to be quashed. In the result, all further proceedings in C.C.No.78/2016 are quashed. It is made clear that this order will not stand in the way of the 2 respondent to proceed with civil proceedings against the accused, in case such proceedings will lie. Sd/- B.
