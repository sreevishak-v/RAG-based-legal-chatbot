M.C No. 100 of 2015 & 101 of 2015 Dated this the 8\" day of January, 2015. ORDER Two prosecutions brought as case and counter, are sought to be quashed under Section 482 Cr.P.C on the ground of amicable settlement made by the parties out of court. Crime No.998/2011 was registered in the Vadakkencherry police Station under Sections 341, 323, 324 IPC, on the complaint of one Kalidasan. The said case is now pending as C.C No.57/2012 before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Alathur. The Petitioner in Crl.MC 100/2015 is the accused in the said case, and the first respondent therein is the said Kalidasan who made complaint. Asa counter case Crime No.999/2011 was also registered under Section 324 of IPC on the complaint of one Unnikrishnan who also sustained injuries in the incident. The said crime is now pending as C.C No.558/2012 before the same court. The de facto complainant in C.C No.57/2012 is the accused in the said case, and he is the petitioner in Crl.M.C 1101/2015. Unnikrishnan who sustained injuries on the other side is the first respondent in Crl.M.C 101/2015. Now the parties have come to terms amicably, and nobody wants to continue the prosecution. Unnikrishnan and Kalidasan have filed affidavit to the effect that the BER El 2015/KER/789 Crl. M.C No. 100 of 2015 & 101 of 2015 2 whole dispute stands settled and resolved, and that they have no complaint or grievance now. I am well satisfied that there is a real and genuine settlement between the parties, and continuance of prosecution in such a situation will do harm and hardship to both the parties. In a situation of amicable settlement nobody will support the prosecution, if the cases go to trial. Thus continuance of prosecution will be a sheer waste of time. In the result, both the petitions are allowed. The prosecution against the petitioner in Crl.M.C 100/2015 in C.C No. 57/2012 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Alathur, and also the prosecution against the petitioner in Cril.M.C 101/2015 in C.C No.558/2012 of the same court, will stand quashed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. Accordingly, the petitioners will stand released from prosecution, and the bail bond, if any, executed by them will stand discharged. Sd/- P.UBAID, JUDGE sab : ee ropes 2015/KER/789 Cri.
