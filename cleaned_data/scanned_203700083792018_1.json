CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 04.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: 2019/KER/353 Crl.M.C.No.8379/18 2 ORDERxXx This petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (the Code for brevity) with a prayer to quash the proceedings pending against the petitioner. 2. The petitioner herein is the accused in Crime No.466 of 2018 of the Pallithottam Police Station, Kollam, registered under Sections 341 and 323 of the IPC. 3. I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, the party respondents and also the learned Public Prosecutor. It is submitted that the entire disputes between the parties have been amicably resolved. Reliance is placed on the affidavits filed by the party respondents to buttress his submission. It is urged that the dispute is purely personal in nature and would not affect public peace or tranquility. 4. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted that the statement of the de facto complainant has been recorded and she has stated in clear terms that she has no _ subsisting grievance. 2019/KER/353 Crl.M.C.No.8379/18 3 5. Ihave considered the submissions advanced. 6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303] and in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466], the Apex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. 7. The offence committed by the petitioner cannot be said to be grave and serious having ingredients of extreme mental depravity. It also does not appear that the offence in this case will have a serious impact on the society. It is felt that quashing of proceedings on account of compromise would bring about peace and secure the ends of justice. Even otherwise, persisting with the prosecution would be nothing but a waste of time as the prospects of conviction is bleak. Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I am of the considered view that this Court will be well justified in invoking its extraordinary powers under Section 482 of the Code to quash the proceedings. BIRR Tal om nite pre Elz ere 2019/KER/353 Crl.M.C.No.8379/18 4 In the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-A2 Final Report and all proceedings pursuant thereto against the petitioner in C.C No. 439/2018 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class-III, Kollam are quashed.
