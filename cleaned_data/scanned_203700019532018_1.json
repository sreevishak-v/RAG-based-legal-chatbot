CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 05.11.2019, THE COURT ON 06.01.2020 PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Crl.MC.No.1953 OF 2018 2020/KERIT 2 R. NARAYANA PISHARADI, J Cri.M.C No. 1953 of 2018 ORDER The petitioners are the accused 1 to 5 in the case C.C No.1236/2017 on the file of the Court of the Judicial First Class Magistratre, Chittur. 2. The aforesaid case is one instituted upon the private complaint (Annexure-A) filed against the petitioners by the first respondent (hereinafter referred to as 'the complainant). 3. This petition is filed under Section 482 CrP.C for quashing the proceedings initiated against the petitioners based on Annexure-A complaint. However, the petitioners have not produced copy of the order of the learned Magistrate taking cognizance of the offences. 4. The offences alleged against the petitioners in Annexure-A complaint are punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 452, 341, 324, 294(b) and 506(ii) read with 149 IPC. Since the petitioners have not produced the copy of the order of the learned Magistrate taking cognizance of the offences, it is not possible to ascertain whether the learned Magistrate has taken cognizance of all the offences mentioned above. a Crl.MC.No.1953 OF 2018 2020/KERIT 3 5. The prayer for quashing the proceedings against the petitioners is made on the ground that the averments/allegations in Annexure-A complaint do not disclose the ingredients of the aforesaid offences alleged against the petitioners. 6. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the first respondent. 7. The material averments contained in Annexure-A complaint are as follows: The complainant and the petitioners are neighbours and relatives. There were disputes between them regarding diversion of water to the property of the complainant. On 15.02.2015, at about 16:00 hours, the second accused entered into the compound of the house of the complainant and created a commotion. Then, the first and the third accused, who were with the second accused, caught hold of the neck of the complainant and pushed him. On that day, at about 19:00 hours, the accused 1 to 5 entered into the compound of the house of the complainant and again created a commotion. The third accused took a stone and threw it towards Pranav, who is a relative of the complainant, causing injury to Pranav. The first accused beat Deepak, another relative of the complainant, with a wooden stick causing injury to him. The accused then trespassed into the house of the complainant. When the mother of the complainant asked them to a Crl.MC.No.1953 OF 2018 2020/KERIT 4 go out of the house, the second accused used obscene words to her annoyance. The father of the complainant then reached the house after his work. The accused together then obstructed him. The fourth accused beat the father of the complainant with a wooden stick and hit on his chest and face. The first and the second accused beat the complainant with a wooden stick. The first accused threatened that he would kill everybody. The accused have committed the aforesaid acts in furtherance of their common object. 8. It is doubtful whether the offence punishable under Section 294(b) IPC alleged against the accused would lie in view of the averment that the use of the obscene words by the accused occurred within the house of the complainant and not in a public place. Apart from that fact, learned counsel for the petitioners has not pointed out, why the other offences alleged against the accused would not be attracted on the basis of the averments/allegations in the complaint. The averments/allegations in the complaint, prima facie, attract the ingredients of all the offences alleged against the petitioners/accused except the offence punishable under Section 294(b) IPC. 9. The complainant is an accused in the case registered by the police for an offence punishable under Section 326 IPC. The aforesaid case is one registered on the basis of the first information statement Bia Crl.MC.No.1953 OF 2018 2020/KERIT 5 given to the police by the fourth petitioner. The allegation against the complainant in that case is that, on the same day at about 17:30 hours, he hit the fourth petitioner with a hammer causing fracture to the bones of his nose and jaw. Existence of such a case against the complainant is not a sufficient ground to find that the incident alleged in the present case did not take place. 10. The complainant had originally filed the complaint against the petitioners on 04.05.2015 in the court and it was forwarded to the police for investigation under Section 156(3) CrP.C. On the basis of the aforesaid complaint, a case was registered against the petitioners as Crime No. 415/2015 of Chittur Police Station. But after investigation, the police referred the aforesaid case as false. The present case (C.C No. 1236/2017) against the petitioners is based on the protest complaint filed by the complainant. Since the averments/allegations in that complaint, prima facie, attract the offences alleged against the petitioners, the prayer for quashing the complaint cannot be allowed. 11. Merely for the reason that there was delay on the part of the complainant in filing the original complaint against the petitioners it cannot be found that the incident alleged had not taken place. Whether the complainant has got any explanation for the delay in a Crl.MC.No.1953 OF 2018 2020/KERIT 6 filing the complaint, whether the explanation, if any, given by him is satisfactory or not etc. are matters to be decided by the trial court after taking evidence. 12. It is stated in the petition that the action of the learned Magistrate taking cognizance of the offences based on Annexure-A complaint indicates non-application of mind. However, as noticed earlier, the petitioners have not even produced a copy of the order of the learned Magistrate taking cognizance of the offences. 13. In the aforesaid circumstances, I find that there are no sufficient grounds to quash Annexure-A complaint or the proceedings initiated against the petitioners on the basis of that complaint. The petition is liable to be dismissed. Consequently, the petition is dismissed. Sd/-R. NARAYANA PISHARADI JUDGE Isn Fert 74.
