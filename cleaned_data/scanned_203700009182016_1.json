TO JUDGE Bt 2018/KER/238 B. SUDHEENDRA KUMAR, J. Crl.M.C. No. 918 of 2016 Dated this the 4 day of January, 2018 ORDER The petitioner is the accused in L.P. No. 62 of 2008 on the files of the court below. The above case arose out of Annexure-Al complaint filed by the 2\"? respondent before the court below against the petitioner alleging offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (the N.I.Act for short). 2. The petitioner has filed this Crl. M.C. praying for quashing Annexure-Al complaint and _ further proceedings in the above case. 3. Service is complete. However, there is no appearance for the 2\" respondent. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Public Desa 2018/KER/238 -2- Cri.M.C. No. 918 of 2016 Prosecutor. 4. The learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that eventhough the matter was settled between the parties, the 2\"? respondent did not incline to withdraw Annexure-Al complaint and in the said circumstances, the petitioner is constrained to approach this Court with the above Crl. M.C. Annexure-A2 would show that the matter has been settled between the parties. The petitioner produced before this Court the original cheque No. 551366 dated 3-10-2005 for Rs. 2,50,000/-, which is the cheque referred to in Annexure-Al complaint. Since the petitioner has produced the original cheque before this Court, that itself would indicate that no successful prosecution against the petitioner pursuant to Annexure-Al complaint can be sustained. Therefore, no purpose will be served even if the prosecution against the petitioner is permitted to be continued. For the said reason, I am inclined to quash Annexure-Al complaint and further proceedings against Bt pees 2018/KER/238 -3- Cri.M.C. No. 918 of 2016 the petitioner in L.P No. 62 of 2008 in C.C.
