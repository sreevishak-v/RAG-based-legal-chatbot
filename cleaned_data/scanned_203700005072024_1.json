CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 18.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: on 2024/KER/4123 CRL.MC_507/2024 2 BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J nmr ORDER Petitioner is the accused in S.C.No.378/2019 on the files of the Additional Sessions Court-1, Kalpetta; alleging offence punishable under Section 20(B)(ii)(b) of the Narcotcs Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. Due to the failure of the petitioner to appear before the trial court, the learned Sessions Judge, on 29.11.2023, issued a non bailable warrant to the accused and a notice to the sureties. Hence, this petition. 2. Smt.Reeha Khader K., the learned counsel for the petitioner, submitted that the failure of the petitioner to appear before the trial court is not willful and that he is willing to participate in further postings without fail. However, petitioner apprehends that he may be remanded to custody before consideration of his application. 3. I have heard Smt.Sreeja V., the learned Public Prosecutor as on BE) 2024/KER/4123 CRL.MC 507/2024 3 well. 4. Having regard to the circumstances of the case, especially since it was submitted that the trial has practically been completed and that what remains is only the final hearing; I am of the view that a lenient view can be adopted. 5. Accordingly, there will be a direction to the learned Sessions Judge to consider the application for recall of warrant and for grant of bail, positively on the same day itself, provided such applications are filed by the petitioner within ten days from today. The Crl.M.C.is disposed of. sd/- BECHU KURIAN THOMAS JUDGE AMV/19/01/2024 Lo BE) 2024/KER/4123 CRL.MC 507/2024 4 APPENDIX OF CRL.MC 507/2024 PETITIONER ANNEXURES ANNEXURE 1 A TRUE COPY OF THE PROCEDURE SHEET OF THE HON 'BLE TRIAL COURT DATED 19-12-2023 TRUE COPY"
