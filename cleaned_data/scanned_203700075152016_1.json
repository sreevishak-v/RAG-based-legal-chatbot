RESPONDENT(S) EXHIBITS NIL R.AV /{True Copy// PA to Judge aa SUNIL THOMAS, J. EN CrI.M.C.No.7515 of 2016 Dated this the 6 day of January, 2017 ORDER The petitioners herein are the accused Nos. 1 and 2 in CC.3643/2015 of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Tripunithura for offences under Sections 420, 120b of the Indian Penal Code along with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. 2. The crux of the allegation raised by the defacto complaint who is the first respondent is that, the petitioners herein had entered into an agreement for sale to assign their property for a total consideration of Rs.10,00,000/- (Rupees ten lakhs' only) received Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees five lakhs only). In spite of receipt of the entire consideration, without assigning the property to the defacto complainant assigned the property to third party. 3. The crux of the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners is that, they have not entered into an agreement for sale and certain blank documents Crl.M.C.No.7515 of 2016 2 obtained by the first respondent in another transaction was misused by forging her signature. To buttress that argument, the learned counsel has relied on Annexure- A3, which is claimed to be a blank signed stamp paper entrusted with the accused. It was further contended that the case has got essentially the nature of a civil dispute and no criminal intention can be attributed to the parties. 4. Essentially the question whether the petitioners herein had entered into an agreement for sale, even if such an agreement was entered into whether the accused had an intention from the beginning not to assign the property and to cheat them, are all matters of evidence. Though the learned counsel for the petitioners relied on unreported decisions of this court in Crl.M.C.No.869/2015 which is also broadly based on the similar facts, I am not inclined to agree with the contentions of the petitioners. The above decisions refers to the case wherein due to reasons beyond the control of the owner of the property, it could not be assigned. These are all facts to be decided by the trial court itself. Considering these facts, I am not al aa Bia 2017/KER/710 Crl.M.C.No.7515 of 2016 3 inclined to quash the proceedings at this stage. Crl.M.C fails and is dismissed, reserving the right of the petitioners herein to advance all their arguments before the court below. In the event of the petitioners herein filing an application for permanent exemption and for permission to appear before the court below through counsel, that can be considered by the court below, having regard to the fact that the petitioners are women and also mother and daughter.
