In fact, all the specific allegations were against the 2 accused in the case. A2 to A4 faced the trial before the Grama Nyayalaya and they were acquitted by the Grama Nyayalaya for want of evidence through Annexure- A3 judgment. 3. The case against the petitioner is now pending as C.C.201/2017 of the Grama Nyayalaya, Parappa. On going through Annexure A3 judgment, it seems that even if the trial BREE 2018/KER/260 CRL.M.C.No. 8698 of 2017 uoe against the petitioner is proceeded with, no fruitful purpose would be served and therefore, all further proceedings in C.C.201/2017 of the Grama Nyayalaya, Parappa, West, Eleri, can be quashed. In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and all further proceedings in C.C.201/2017 of the Grama Nyayalaya, Parappa, West, Eleri, as against the petitioner, are hereby quashed. Sd/- B.
