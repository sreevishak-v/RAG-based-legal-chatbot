The offences alleged against the petitioners are punishable under Sections 57(a) and 56(b) of the Abkari Act, 1077. 3. The first petitioner is the Manager and the second petitioner is the licensee of the toddy shop No.24/2018-19 of the Nooranad Excise Range. The Excise Inspector of Nooranad Excise Range took three samples of toddy from the aforesaid shop on 08.12.2018. The samples were marked as 'A' sample, 'B' sample and 'C' sample. The chemical analysis of 'A' sample revealed that apt 2020/KER/172 Cr1.M.C.No.8437/2019 3 the said sample contained Sodium Lauryl Suphate, an adulterant. Annexure-A is the copy of the certificate relating to the analysis of 'A' sample. On the basis of Annexure-A certificate, a case was registered against the petitioners as C.R.No.11/2019 of the Nooranad Excise Range. 4. The 'B' sample was sent for chemical analysis at the instance of the petitioners. It was sent through the court. Annexure-B certificate of analysis in respect of the 'B' sample shows that no Sodium Lauryl Sulphate was detected in it. 5. Even before the receipt of Annexure-B certificate, chargesheet against the petitioners was filed in the court for the offences mentioned above. Learned Magistrate has taken cognizance of the offences. 6. This petition is filed under Section 482 CrP.C for quashing the proceedings against the petitioners which are based on Annexure-C chargesheet. 7. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned Public Prosecutor. apt 2020/KER/172 Cr1.M.C.No.8437/2019 1 8. Learned counsel for the petitioners contended that in view of the contradictory chemical analysis reports, the prosecution against the petitioners is liable to be quashed. 9. Learned Public Prosecutor contended that the accused had no right to get the second sample analysed and therefore, Annexure-B certificate cannot be taken into consideration by the court. 10. The question whether the accused had right to get the second sample sent for chemical analysis does not arise in this case. The fact remains that the State did not challenge the order of the learned Magistrate allowing the application filed by the petitioners for sending the second sample for analysis. 11. Annexure-C chargesheet against the petitioners was filed in the court on 25.10.2019. Annexure-B report is dated 28.10.2019. Annexure-C chargesheet was filed in the court even before the receipt of Annexure-B report. It means that there can be nothing in the chargesheet which would enable the prosecution to challenge the correctness of Annexure-B report. . apt 2020/KER/172 Cr1.M.C.No.8437/2019 : If the second report is in favour of the accused and if there is no material in the final report to disprove or discredit the report in respect of the second sample or if there is no challenge against the report in respect of the second sample, then the final report is liable to be quashed. In view of Annexure-B certificate of analysis, no successful prosecution can be sustained. Even if the prosecution is permitted to be continued, no purpose would be served. Therefore, I am _ inclined to quash Annexure-C chargesheet and further proceedings against the petitioners based on it. 12. In the result, this petition is allowed. Annexure-C final report laid in C.R.No.11/2019 of the Nooranad Excise Range and all further proceedings pursuant thereto, as against the petitioners, are hereby quashed.
