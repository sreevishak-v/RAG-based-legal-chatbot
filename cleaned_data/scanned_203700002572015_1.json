The offences involved in this case are under Sections 147, 148, 447, 427, 324 and 506(2) r/w 149 of the Indian Penal Code. The original accused Nos.2 and 5 faced trial before the trial court and obtained a judgment of acquittal under Section 248(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure when all the material witnesses including the de facto complainant turned hostile to the prosecution in view of an amicable settlement made by the parties out of court. The prosecution examined four witnesses in the said case including de facto complainant and also marked Ext.P1. None of the material witnesses examined in the case supported the prosecution. In such a circumstance, examination of the others was dispensed with, and evidenced was closed by the trial court. In the absence of any evidence or incriminating circumstance, the learned trial Magistrate acquitted the accused Nos.2 and 5. The case against the petitioner herein was split up and refiled as C.C No. 904/2008 and it is now transferred to the register of long pending cases as L.P No.166/2011 before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Malappuram. The petitioner now seeks orders quashing the prosecution as against him on the ground that the 2015/KER/2001 Crl.M.C No.257 of 2015 2 very substratum of the prosecution case is totally lost by the acquittal of the others, and continuance of prosecution against him will not serve any purpose. Annexure II judgment in C.C No.604/2007 shows that all the material witnesses examined by the prosecution in the said case turned hostile in view of an amicable settlement made by the parties out of court. In such a situation, it is quite definite that the prosecution cannot in any manner improve the case, and the witnesses also cannot in any manner help the prosecution, if the case against the petitioner goes to trial. In short, such proceeding will be a sheer waste of time. In the result, this petition is allowed. The prosecution against the petitioner in C.C No.904/2008 before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Malapuram, which stands transferred to the register of long pending cases as L.P No.166/2011, will stand quashed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Accordingly, the petitioner will stand released from prosecution, and the bail bond, if any, executed by him will stand discharged. P.UBAID JUDGE ab"
