Bieaee 2016/KER/33869 SUNIL THOMAS, J. Crl.M.C.No.516 of 2016 Dated this the 3\" day of August, 2016 ORDER The petitioners herein are the accused Nos. 2 and 3 in Crime No.58/2015 of Shornur Police station for offences punishable under Section 498(A), (ii) read with Section 34 IPC. 2. The defacto complainant filed a complaint alleging matrimonial cruelty against her husband arraying him as the first accused and the petitioners herein as accused Nos. 2 and 3. On the basis of the complaint lodged, investigation was completed, the final report was laid and the matter is now pending as CC No.498/2015 of JFCM Court, Ottapalam. Crl.M.C.is laid on a premise that Annexure Al compliant does not disclose the essential ingredients of an offence punishable under Section 498(A). It was contended by the learned counsel, relying on page 2 of the complaint, that the second and third accused were only the neighbours. There was no demand from them for dowry also. There was no averment that the cruelty was of such a gravity as to drive the defacto complainant to commit suicide. 3. In the light of the above contentions, the learned public meatal Ble 2016/KER/33869 Cri.M.C. No.516/2016 2 prosecutor was directed to ascertain as to whether the petitioners herein are related to the first accused. After verification, learned public prosecutor had submitted that the first petitioner was the uncle of the first accused and the second petitioner was the wife of the first petitioner. This was recorded by order dated 24/6/2016. There are averments in the complaint that the first and the second accused had assaulted the defacto complainant and threatened to kill her if she returned to the house. There are other averments touching upon the cruelty meted out on her. 4. Having regard to the above facts, I am satisfied that the contentions set up by the petitioners herein will not survive. Having regard to this, I am inclined to dismiss the Crl.M.C. reserving the right of the petitioner herein to raise all the above contentions before the trial court. With the above observation, the Crl.M.C.is dismissed. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS Judge dpk /true copy/ PS to Judge. Big ael i Burk 2016/KER/33869 Cri.M.C. No.516/2016 3"
