    "full_text": "1 IN THE COURT OF THE SESSIONS JUDGE, THIRUVANANTHAPURAM PRESENT : SMT. NAZEERA.S, SESSIONS JUDGE On Tuesday, 4\" day of March 2025/13\" day of Phalguna, 1946. Criminal M.C.No. 629/2025 Crime No 325/2025 of Venjaramood Police Station Petitioner/Accused No. 1 :- Aseem S aged 27 years S/o. Shamsheer Kunnil Veedu Nedumkaitha Koonanvenga P.O Pullampara Village Nedumangadu Taluk By Advocate:- S Y Mohan Kumar Kiran Counter Petitioners :- 1. State of Kerala 2. Station House Officer Venjaramoodu Police Station By Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumari This Criminal M.C. is coming on for hearing on 03.03.2025 and the court on 04.03.2025 passed the following ORDER This is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail. 2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable under Sections 126, 296(b), 118(1) and 324, r/w Section 3(5) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, and Crime No. 325/2025 of Venjaramood Police Station is registered against the petitioner arraying him as the 1* accused. 2 3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- On 18.02.2025 at about 6 p.m., accused Nos. 1 to 3 trespassed into the Provision Store run by the defacto complainant, situated in Panvoor Village, and demanded cotton bandage. The defacto complainant informed the accused that cotton bandage is not available in his shop. Infuriated by this, the accused uttered abusive words against the defacto complainant and rambled and destroyed the chilly powder and bakery products kept in the shop, causing a loss of Rs.1,500/- to the defacto complainant. When the defacto complainant intervened, the 2\" accused caught hold of his collar and the 1* accused fisted him on his forehead, using a sharp weapon, causing an injury. Thereafter, all the accused repeatedly fisted on the back and head of the defacto complainant. 4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The Investigating Officer filed report opposing the bail application. 5. Heard. Perused the records. 6. The only point to be considered is, whether pre-arrest bail can be granted to the petitioner/ 1* accused. 7. The Point:- The petitioner / 1 accused along with the other accused are alleged to have abused the defacto complainant and assaulted him, and the petitioner/ 1* accused had used a sharp weapon to fist on the forehead of the defacto complainant, causing injuries. The motive for the alleged 3 incident is the rage that aroused when the defacto complainant told the accused that the cotton bandage demanded by them is not available in his shop. 8. According to the petitioner, he is innocent of the allegations levelled against him. It is submitted that, on the fateful day, one Shiju, who is conducting a stationery store, abused and assaulted the petitioner, and the petitioner filed a complaint in this regard before the Venjaramoodu Police Station, and no action was taken so far, and it is thereafter, the defacto complainant filed a complaint against the petitioner and others and falsely implicated them in this crime. 9. There is serious allegation as against the petitioner. In the First Information Statement given by the defacto complainant, it is stated that, the petitioner/Ist accused along with the other accused had assaulted the defacto complainant, and in that process, the petitioner / 1* accused had fisted on his forehead using a sharp weapon, causing an injury. In the body note with the First Information Statement, it is noted that, the defacto complainant had wound over forehead and pain on back. So, there is corresponding injuries. So, the prosecution has made out a prima facie case against the petitioner/ 1 accused and regarding the involvement of the petitioner in the alleged offence. It is stated in the report that, the ring used for the commission of the offence is to be recovered, and the wound certificate of the victim is to be obtained. The investigation is progressing. Considering the facts stated in the report to the 4 effect that the petitioner is involved in the offence, it appears that exceptional jurisdiction to grant a pre-arrest bail cannot be exercised in this case. 10. In Jai Prakash Singh v. State of Bihar and Another (2012 (4) SCC 379), the Honble Apex court has held that, an order of pre-arrest bail being an extra ordinary privilege, should be granted only in exceptional cases. It is settled in law that arrest should be the last option and it should be restricted to cases where arrest is imperative in the facts and circumstances of a case and consistent view is that the grant of anticipatory bail shall be restricted to exceptional circumstances. So it is clear that the power to grant anticipatory bail under section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita. is an exceptional power and should be exercised only in exceptional cases and not as a matter of course. Its object is to ensure that a person should not be harassed or humiliated in order to satisfy the grudge or personal vendetta of the complainant. [Reliance placed on the decision rendered by the Honble Apex Court in HDFC Bank Limited v. J.J. Mannan and Another (2010 (1) SCC 679); Srikant Upadhyay v. State of Bihar (2024 KHC Online 6137)]. In the case at hand, I find no exceptional circumstance to exercise the exceptional power of granting anticipatory bail. 11. Considering the serious allegation against the petitioner and gravity of the offence, it appears that granting the petitioner with an order of anticipatory bail will adversely affect the investigation. If an order of 5 anticipatory bail is granted he is likely to influence the witnesses and tamper with the evidence. Considering all these aspects, this court is not inclined to grant an order of pre-arrest bail to the petitioner. In the result, this petition is dismissed.
