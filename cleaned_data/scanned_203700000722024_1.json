CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 11.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Be BleRee et 2024/KER/4272 CRL.MC NO. 72 OF 2024 2 BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J. Dated this the 11% day of January, 2024 ORDER Petitioners are the accused in C.C.No.852/2015 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrates Court, Ottappalam. They face an indictment for the offences under Section 18(a)(i) r/w Section 27(d) of the Drugs and Cosmetic Act, 1940 (for short, the Act). 2. The prosecution allegations are that on 22-04- 2013, when the Drugs Inspector drew a sample of Cefotaxime Injection IP 250 from the Taluk Head Quarters Hospital, Ottappalam, manufactured by the lst accused, it was found, on analysis, to be not of standard quality due to the failure to clear the test for sterility. Since a sub-standard drug had been manufactured and sold by the accused, they are alleged to have committed the offences alleged. 3. The complaint was filed on 16-05-2016 and cognizance was taken in the same year. Petitioners Be Blea 2024/KER/4272 CRL.MC NO. 72 OF 2024 3 have been participating in the proceedings before the Trial Court. However, after 9 years of taking cognizance, they have now approached this Court, pointing out that their prosecution is an abuse of process of the Court, primarily on account of the violation of the mandatory provisions of Section 23(4) (iii) and Section 25(3) of the Act. 4. According to Adv.Susmith Kumar T.D., the valuable rights of the accused have been denied due to the failure of the Drugs Inspector to provide the third sample of the drug as contemplated under Section 23(iv)(3) of the Act and also because the certificate of analysis and the test report were not forwarded to the petitioners, thereby contravening the provisions of the statute. He relies upon the decision Laborate Pharmaceuticals India Ltd. And Others v. State of Tamil Nadu (2018) 15 SCC 93 in support of his contentions. 5. Sri. Grashious Kuriakose, the learned ADGP contended that the challenge to the prosecution proceedings by invoking the provisions of Section 482 Be Blea 2024/KER/4272 CRL.MC NO. 72 OF 2024 4 of Cr.P.C., is too belated, especially since the trial is about to start. He further argued that all contentions now raised by the petitioners can be agitated before the trial Court and that no valuable rights of the accused have been denied since the mandatory documents were all forwarded to the accused within time. It was further contended that the accused had, in fact, refused to accept the documents that were sent, and hence it is a matter for trial, where evidence may have to be appreciated. 6. While considering the contentions advanced by the respective counsel, this court takes note of the circumstance that the complaint was filed in 2015 and cognizance was taken as C.C.No.852/2015 by the learned Magistrate. Concededly, the matter has been pending before the trial Court for the last 9 years and the case is ripe for trial. Contentions now raised by the petitioners and controverted by the prosecution fall within the realm of disputed facts and require appreciation of evidence, especially in the light of the submission on behalf of the prosecution that the Be Be anes 4 2024/KER/4272 CRL.MC NO. 72 OF 2024 5 mandatory documents were all sent to the petitioner, which was refused to be received by him. 7. In such a view of the matter, I am of the opinion that the remedy under Section 482 is not available to the petitioner. Hence, I find no merit in this Crl.M.C. and it is dismissed.
