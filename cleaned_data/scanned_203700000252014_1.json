The petitioner stands accused of having committed the offence punishable under Section 354(A) of IPC in Crime No. 850/2013 of Kannur Town Police Station. After investigation, final report was laid and cognizance of the offence was taken as C.C.No. 1117 of 2013. 3. Itis unnecessary to go into the facts and details of the case for the simple reason that the petitioner has chosen to implead the defacto complaint/victim as the second respondent who has entered appearance through a counsel and who accepts that the Annexure-A2 affidavit filed along with this petition is one sworn to by the second respondent Biehl ee Elz ere 2014/KER/212 Crl.M.C. No.25/2014 -2- herself and she stands by the statements contained therein. 4. On going through affidavit, it is seen that the parties have settled all their differences and issues between them and the victim has no further grievance in the matter. lt is pointed out that she is disinterested in continuing the proceedings. 6. In the light of the above stand taken by the de facto complainant, it is felt that continuance of the proceedings will only be an exercise in futility. Hence, this petition is allowed. All further proceedings in C.C.No. 1117 of 2013 pending before Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-l, Kannur including the final report based on which cognizance was taken shall stand quashed and the petitioner shall stand discharged.
