BY ADV. SRI.P.YADHU KUMAR SMT. REKHA C. NAIR SR. PP. THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 09.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: bie Crl.MC.No. 8776 of 2018 201KER/T24S 2 ORDER This petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (the Code for brevity) with a prayer to quash the proceedings pending against the petitioner. 2. The petitioner herein is the accused in C.C. No.1111 of 2018 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Vaikom. In the aforesaid case, he stands indicted for having committed offence punishable under Sections 323, 324, 294(b) and 506(i) of the IPC. The 3 respondent is the wife of the petitioner herein. 3. I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, the party respondent and the learned Public Prosecutor. It is submitted that the entire disputes between the parties have been amicably resolved. Attention of this Court is invited to the affidavit filed by the 3 respondent to buttress his submission. It is urged that the dispute is purely personal in nature and would not affect public peace or tranquility. 4. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted that the statement of the 3 respondent has been recorded and she bie Crl.MC.No. 8776 of 2018 201KER/T24S 3 has stated in clear terms that she has no subsisting grievance. 5. I have considered the submissions advanced. 6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303] and in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466], the Apex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. 7. The offence committed by the petitioner cannot be said to be grave and serious having ingredients of extreme mental depravity. It also does not appear that the offence in this case will have a serious impact on the society. It is felt that quashing of proceedings on account of compromise would bring about peace and secure the ends of justice. Even otherwise, persisting with the prosecution would be nothing but a waste of time as the prospects of conviction is bleak. Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I am of the considered view that this Court will be well justified in invoking its extraordinary powers under Section 482 of the Code to quash the proceedings. nas Lets i] El sas Crl.MC.No. 8776 of 2018 2019/KER/1245 4 In the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-A FIR and all proceedings pursuant thereto against the petitioner now pending as C.C. No. 1111 of 2018 on the file of Judicial Magistrate of First Class, Vaikom are quashed.
