RESPONDENT(S)' EXHIBITS wen ene ne neem ene nnenennnneneneneenenenen : NIL True Copy// PA. to Judge ss K. RAMAKRISHNAN, J. 2015/KER/17321 ORDER This criminal miscellaneous case is filed by the petitioner to quash the proceedings in C.P.No.145/20104 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Harippad, Alappuzha District. 2. It is alleged in the petition that, the petitioner has been arrayed as accused in Crime No.387/2014 of Kareelakulangara police station, alleging offence under Section 304 and 308 of the Indian Penal Code. According to the petitioner, on 03.04.2014 at about 12.30 p.m., while the petitioner was driving a Volvo Tourist bus from Bangalore to Thiruvananthapuram and when it reached Nangiarkulangara at about 12.30 p.m., it collided with a maruti 800 car, coming from the opposite direction and in order to avert the car, it hit against the bicycle, which was crossing the road and five adult persons 2015/KER/17321 Criminal M.C.No.2536 of 2015 ; traveling in the car and a four year child were critically injured and five persons died. Originally case was registered under Section 279, 304 and 324 of the Indian Penal Code. He was arrested on 03.04.2014 and bail was granted later as per order in B.A.No.3594/2014. Final report was filed, in which he was charge-sheeted for the offence under Section 304 and 308 of the Indian Penal Code and on that basis, case was taken on file as C.P.No.145/2014 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Harippad. According to the petitioner no offence under Section 304 or 308 of the Indian Penal Code have been committed. So he filed this application for quashing the proceedings. 3. Heard the counsel for the petitioner and Public Prosecutor appearing for the respondent. 4. According to the counsel, the case was originally registered for the offence under Section 279, 304 and 324 of the Indian Penal Code and later final report was 2015/KER/17321 Criminal M.C.No.2536 of 2015 ; filed for the offence under Section 304 and 308 of the Indian Penal Code. According to the learned counsel, the allegations are not sufficient to attract the offence. It may be mentioned here that, on going through the allegations, this court felt that, it is not a fit case to invoke the power under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to quash the proceedings at this stage and the documents produced by the petitioner are all matters to be considered by the court below at the time of trial and those documents cannot be considered at this stage for quashing the proceedings. It is also settled law that, ifa matter has to be decided on evidence, then, it is not proper for this court to invoke the power under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and quash the proceedings at the initial stage itself. The petitioner can raise all his contentions before the trial court after the case is committed to the Sessions Court and if he files an application for discharge, then that court can consider those aspects and then pass appropriate ap 2015/KER/17321 Criminal M.C.No.2536 of 2015 4 orders in that application in accordance with law. With the above direction and observation, the petition is disposed of. Communicate this order to the concerned court immediately. Sd/- K. RAMAKRISHNAN, JUDGE // True Copy// P.A. to Judge ss"
