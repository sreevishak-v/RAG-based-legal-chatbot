Crl.M.C.No.5273 of 2016 Dated this the 9\" day of January, 2017 ORDER Petitioner herein is the sole accused in Crime No.391 of 2008 of Kondoitty Police Station for offences punishable under sections 419, 468 and 471 of Indian Penal Code and Section 12(1)(b) of the Passport Act, 1967. 2. The crux of the prosecution case is that the petitioner herein had obtained a passport with forged documents. When this was detected, crime was registered. The investigation is still pending. According to the petitioner herein, the long delay in filing the final report causes irreparable injury to him. He has now been offered a job abroad. Hence, he sought permission of the court below to apply for a fresh passport. Court below, by Annexure-B order dismissed the application on the reasoning that the investigation is still going on and if the petitioner is permitted to leave abroad, that is likely to hamper the investigation. Learned Public Prosecutor submitted that the petitioner herein is alleged to have changed photograph in his passport and hence the question of his identity may also arise. It is further submitted that the 2017/KER/951 Crl.M.C.5273/16 2 documents have been forwarded to the FSL for expert opinion. 3. Evidently, the disputed passport is with the investigating agency. Investigation has not reached its final stage in spite of long lapse of time. Petitioner herein may not be restrained on account of pendency of the case, which would affect his livelihood. In the light of above, I am inclined to set aside the impugned order. The petitioner herein is permitted to apply for a fresh passport, which may be issued by the authorities, if otherwise permissible, for a period not less than two years. It is made clear that this permission is only for the limited purpose for applying for a passport. For the purpose of permission to leave the country, petitioner herein shall move the court below with appropriate application detailing the country which he proposes to visit, period of his stay there, purpose, his contact details and also the period during which he proposes to leave the country. Court below shall consider it and permit him to leave the country for a period of one year at a stretch. Crl.M.C is disposed of as above. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS Judge Sbna/9/1/17 True Copy / P A to Judge"
