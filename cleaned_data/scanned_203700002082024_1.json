CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 10.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: PSR et 2024/KER/1595 CRL.M.C.No.208/2024 ; SOPHY THOMAS, J CrL.M.C.Mo.208 of 2024 Dated this the 10\" day of January, 2024 ORDER This is a petition under Section 482 of CrPC filed by the sole accused in SC 183/2020 on the file of the Fast Track Special Court, Thalassery, for quashing Annexure-3 order dated 24.11.2023. 2. The petitioner filed Section 311 CrPC petition as Crl.M.P.No.532/2023 before the Fast Track Special Court, Thalassery, for recalling the victim boy, who was examined as PW1 on 04.10.2023. According to learned counsel for the petitioner, some material questions were omitted to be asked during cross-examination. He filed an application under Section 311 CrPC earlier also, but it was dismissed for default. Subsequently, he filed Crl.M.P.No.532/2023, for the very same purpose. 3. The learned trial Judge in paragraph 7 of Annexure- 3 order has stated that, on which aspect the witness has to be questioned further, was not clear from the petition filed by him. More over, the victim was cross-examined in detail on PSR et 2024/KER/1595 CRL.M.C.No.208/2024 3 04.10.2023. The victim boy was aged only 13 years, at the time of the alleged incident in the year 2018. So the Court found that there is no need for a further cross-examination of PW1. Learned counsel for the petitioner would contend that the matter is settled and the parents of the victim boy turned hostile to the prosecution. Hostility of witnesses cannot be termed as settlement always. Since PW1 was cross-examined in detail on 04.10.2023 and the questions omitted to be asked during his cross-examination will not find a place in the petition, this Court finds no illegality and impropriety in Annexure-3 order. So this Crl.M.C. stands dismissed. The petitioner is at liberty to file a fresh application, before the trial court stating the factum of settlement and the learned Sessions Judge on ascertaining the factual situation from the parents of the victim, is at liberty to entertain such application, and to pass orders in accordance with law.
