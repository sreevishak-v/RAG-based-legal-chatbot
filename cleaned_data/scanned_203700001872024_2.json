He is facing prosecution for various offences, including Section 308 of the Indian Penal Code, i860. After the petitioner was granted bail, he failed to appear on 28.12.2023 and therefore the learned Sessions Judge cancelled the bail and issued a non-bailable warrant for his appearance. 2. Sri.R.Sunil Kumar, the learned counsel for the petitioner contended that though petitioner is willing to appear before the court and seek bail, he apprehends that he may be remanded to custody and hence he seeks for a direction to consider his bail application and application to recall the warrant on the same date. 3. I have heard Smt.Sreeja V., the learned Public Prosecutor as well. 4. Considering the circumstances arising in the case, I am of the view that the request of the petitioner ought to be allowed. 5. Accordingly, there will be a direction to the learned Sessions Judge to consider the bail application as well as the petition for recall of warrant on the same day itself, provided such applications are filed by petitioner within ten days from today. The non-bailable warrant issued eee [thoes ear Elz ae 2024/KER/2167 CRL.MC NO. 187 OF 2024 3 against the petitioner will be kept in abeyance for a period of ten days from today to enable the petitioner to abide by the direction mentioned above.
