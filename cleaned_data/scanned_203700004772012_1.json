Dated this the 1* day of January, 2044. ORDER Petitioner is the accused in C.C.No.233 of 2011 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kunnamkulam. Annexure A is the complaint. Gist of allegations against the petitioner is that he entered into an agreement with the complainant for purchase of a land. Thereafter the land was conveyed to the petitioner by virtue of a registered document. At the time of finalisation of the deal an amount of 78,33,400/- was outstanding as balance consideration. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the vendor/complainant had already agreed to sell this property to one Dr.Saifu and there was some dispute between the complainant and Dr.Saifu. which was not known to the petitioner at the time of purchase. Having came to know about that dispute, balance amount was retained and that is mentioned in an agreement, which is produced as Annexure E. Annexure F is the copy of the plaint filed by Dr.Saifu against the complainant and his wife claiming compensation for the breach of coniract. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that in paragraph 2 of the petition, petitioner has specifically stated that the amount of %8,33,400/- is retained by the petitioner as agreed to by the 2014/KER/47 Crl.MC No.477/2012 2 parties in Annexure E for meeting possible future expenses. It is also submitted that immediately the civil suit is settled or disposed of, the petitioner will pay the balance amount found to be due to the complainant as stated in Annexure E. On going through the materials on record, | am satisfied that the dispute predominantly is of a civil nature. The offence of cheating alleged against the petitioner will not lie in a legal sense because breach of an agreement cannot be termed as an offence falling within the definition of cheating under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code. Therefore, the petition is to be allowed to meet the ends of justice. In the result, petition is allowed. The complaint in C.C.No.233 of 2011 pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-lV, Kunnamkulam is hereby quashed. All pending interlocutory applications will stand dismissed. A. HARIPRASAD, JUDGE. cks"
