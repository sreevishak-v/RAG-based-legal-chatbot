Criminal M.C.No. 628/2025 ( Crime No. 141/2025 of Valiyathura Police Station pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court -XI Thiruvananthapuram) Petitioner :- Bipin Thomas aged 36 years S/o. Thomas, Bipin Bhavan Narikkal Desam Kottavattam Chakkuvarakkal Village Vettikavala Panchayath Kollam By Advocate:- Honey MA Counter Petitioners :- 1. State of Kerala 2. The Station House Officer Valiyathura Police Station Thiruvananthapuram By Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumari This Criminal M.C. is coming on for hearing on 28.02.2025 and the court on 01.03.2025 passed the following : ORDER This is an application filed by the sole accused in the above crime under Section 483 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking regular bail. 2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable under Sections 75(1)(iii), 75(1)(iv), 75(2), 78(1)(ii), 78(2) and 79 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, and Section 67A of the Information Technology Act. 3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- The accused, from 25.01.2025 onwards repeatedly called the defacto complainant over phone, and when she blocked his phone number, on 27.01.2025, the accused, by using another phone 2 number, tried to contact the defacto complainant through Whatsapp video call and the defacto complainant did not attend the call. Thereafter, the accused sent a message to her asking her to attend the video call, and subsequently, on 02.02.2025, the accused showed his private part to the defacto complainant by way of video call, and followed her, despite a clear indication of disinterest by her. 4. Reportedly, the petitioner/accused was arrested on 05.02.2025 and he is in custody since then. 5. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The Investigating Officer filed report opposing the bail application. 6. Heard. Perused the records. 7. The only point to be considered is, whether regular bail can be granted to the petitioner/accused. 8. The Point:- The petitioner/accused and the defacto complainant are total strangers. The petitioner/accused is alleged to have followed and attempted to contact the defacto complainant over phone, to foster personal interaction repeatedly, despite a clear indication of disinterest by her, and had showed his private part to her through Whatsapp video call. 9. The petitioner submits that, he and the defacto complainant are friends and known to each other for the past several months, and they used to talk each other over phone and became close friends. It is submitted that, the defacto complainant used to borrow money from the petitioner saying that she is in financial crisis, and on 10.10.2024, the defacto complainant asked him to meet her for discussing some 3 personal matter, and as required, the petitioner met the defacto complainant, and that time, she told him that she is in urgent need of money and requested the petitioner to lend her Rs.1,60,000/-, and since it was a very huge amount, the petitioner was unable to arrange it. It is also submitted that, the petitioner gave her Rs.60,000/- on 23.01.2024, and though she agreed to repay the said amount after six months, she told excuses for repaying the same, and thus their relationship got strained, and thereafter, on 25.01.2025, the defacto complainant made video call to the petitioner and they quarreled each other, and thereafter, the present false complaint has been filed. 10. There is serious allegation as against the petitioner. However, it is seen from the report filed by the Investigating Officer that the mobile phone of the petitioner/accused was seized and potency certificate of the petitioner was obtained. It appears that, the major part of the investigation is over. The petitioner/ accused is in judicial custody for a period of 23 days. It appears that further detention of the petitioner is not warranted for the purpose of investigation. So even if the petitioner is released on bail, there is nothing much, which will adversely affect the investigation. No criminal antecedents of the petitioner/accused is brought to the notice of this court. Considering the period of detention already undergone by the petitioner and the stage of investigation, I am of the view that, the petitioner/accused can be enlarged on bail subject to conditions. In the result, the petition is allowed and the petitioner/ accused is granted bail on the following conditions:- 4 (1) Petitioner/accused shall execute bail bond for Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) with two solvent sureties for the like sum each to the satisfaction of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-XI, Thiruvananthapuram. (2) Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer on every Monday between 10 a.m. and 12 noon for a period of 3 (three) months or till the final report is filed, whichever is earlier. (3) Petitioner shall not commit any offence while on bail. (4) Petitioner shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade them from disclosing such facts to the court or to any police officer or tamper with evidence. (5) Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer as and when required by the Investigating Officer. (6) Petitioner shall fully co-operate with the investigation. In case of any violation of the above conditions or misuse of liberty, the prosecution or the defacto complainant is at liberty to approach jurisdictional court for cancellation of bail.
