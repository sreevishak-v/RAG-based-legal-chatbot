Cri.M.C.No.157 of 2024 Dated this the 9\" day of January, 2024 ORDER Petitioner seeks for a direction to stay all further proceedings in C.C.No.34 of 2018 on the files of the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court, Kollam, for a period of nine months. 2. Petitioner is the first accused in C.C.No.34 of 2018 on the files of the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court, Kollam. On 01.12.2023, charge was framed under Sections 403, 406, 409, 420, 465, 468 and 471 r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal code, 1860. On the said date, summons was issued to CWi to give evidence on 10.01.2024 (tomorrow). Summons have also been issued to CW2 to CW4 to give evidence on 15.01.2024 and CW5 to CW9 on 16.01.2024 and CW10 on 22.01.2024. It is evident that trial has already been scheduled and summons have been issued to the witnesses. In such circumstances, interference with the scheduled trial is not legally permissible. Hence, I find no merit in this Cril.M.C.and the same is dismissed.
