THE CERTIFIED COPY OF THE ORDER DATED 15.10.16 IN CMP 4127/16 OF THE JUDICIAL FIRST CLASS MAGISTRATE COURT 1, KOTTARAKKARA. RESPONDENT(S) EXHIBITS NIL R.AV TRUE COPYI PATO JUDGE 2017/KER/1227 SUNIL THOMAS, J. ~ Crl.M.(C).No.52 of 2017 Dated this the 10 day of January, 2017 ORDER The petitioner herein is the accused who is indicted in Crime No.96/2017 for offences punishable under Sections 58 and 67 of the Abkari Act. He challenges the order in Annexure-A2, which is an application for interim custody of the vehicle owned by him and involved in the case. The application was rejected. The reasons stated by the court below is that, the report of the investigating officer revealed that the confiscation proceedings were going on at the instance of the Deputy Excise Commissioner, Kollam. Consequently the court held that it had no authority to release the vehicle and the petition was consequently dismissed. 2. Challenging this, the learned counsel contended that the order of the court below is not legally sustainable in the light of the clear statutory provision holding that 2017/KER/1227 Cri.M.(C).No.52 of 2017 2 the confiscation proceedings will not be a bar in ordering the release of the vehicle. The learned counsel invited my attention to the decision reported in [Abdul Nazer Vs State of Kerala (2014 (3) KHC 3125)], wherein the court considered this legal aspect and ultimately ordered that the vehicle may be released subject to the execution of the bond. However the learned counsel fairly invited my attention to the clarification given by the Division Bench of this court in unreported decision in W.A.No.1408 of 2016, wherein the Division Bench it confirmed that the vehicle can be released on cash security and not on execution of the bond. Necessarily, the value has to be fixed by the court below on the basis of a report of the competent authority as provided under the statute. The learned counsel also fairly submitted that he can produce an equivalent cash security as fixed by the court below. In the light of above, the impugned order is set aside and CMP.No.4127 of 2016 will stand allowed. The court below shall assess the value of vehicle on the basis of materials placed, as provided under the statute and release the 2017/KER/1227 Crl.M.(C).No.52 of 2017 3 vehicle on such terms and conditions as it may fix as per the statute as expeditiously as possible. Crl.M.C is disposed of accordingly. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE R.AV //{True Copy// PA to Judge"
