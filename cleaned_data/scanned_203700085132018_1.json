BY ADV. SMT.V.T.LITHA SRI B JAYASURYA-PUBLIC PROSECUTOR THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 07.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Bese bie Cr1.MC.No. 8513 of 2018 2 201/KERIO55 ORDER This petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (the Code for brevity). 2. The petitioner herein is the accused in C.C.No.574 of 2018 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Hosdurg. In the said case, he stands indicted for having committed offence punishable under Section 420 of the IPC. The 1* respondent is the de facto complainant. 3. The instant petition is filed with a prayer to quash the proceedings on the ground of settlement of all disputes. The 1* respondent has filed an affidavit stating that she does not wish to continue with the prosecution proceedings against the petitioner. 4. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted that the statement of the 1* respondent has been recorded and the State has no objection in terminating the proceedings as it involves no public interest. Crl.MC.No. 8513 of 2018 3 2019/KERI655 5. I have considered the submissions advanced. 6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303] and in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466], the Apex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. 7. The offence committed by the petitioner cannot be said to be grave and serious having ingredients of extreme mental depravity. It also does not appear that the offence in this case will have a serious impact on the society. It is felt that quashing of proceedings on account of compromise would bring about peace and secure the ends of justice. Even otherwise, persisting with the prosecution would be nothing, but a waste of time as the prospects of conviction is bleak. Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I am of the considered view that this Court will be well justified in invoking its extraordinary powers under Section 482 of the Code to quash the proceedings. In the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-Ai Final BRE Cr1.MC.No. 8513 of 2018 4 2019/KERI655 Report and all proceedings pursuant thereto against the petitioner in C.C.No.574 of 2018 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Hosdurg are quashed.
