RESPONDENTS EXHIBITS: NIL /TRUE COPY/ PS TO JUDGE. 2018/KER/704 SUNIL THOMAS, J. Cr1.M.C.No.4619 of 2017 Dated this the 8\" day of January, 2018 ORDER The sole accused in SC No.1518/2015 of the District and Sessions Court, Kollam arising from Crime No.458/2009 of Ezhukone Police station is the petitioner herein. 2. The above case arose from a private complaint dated 27/7/2009 filed by the third respondent herein. It was alleged in the private complaint that, the petitioner herein was in love with the defacto complainant, who is the third respondent herein, from 2003 onwards, and on 16/7/2008 and 20/7/2008, he committed rape on the third respondent and thereafter on several occasions, on a specific assurance to marry her. She became pregnant and delivered a child. Prior to that, she along with her family members had attempted to settle the matter. In pursuance to it, the third respondent gave notice of special marriage under the Special Marriage Act. While so, the petitioner allegedly retracted from it. The third respondent gave birth to a female child on 15/3/2009. It was alleged that, the child was born on account of the physical Peles Fal 2018/KER/704 Crl.M.C.No.4619/2017 2 relationship of petitioner with the third respondent. Even though complaint was laid to the police, they did not take any action, and hence, the private complaint was filed. A copy of the private complaint was produced as Annexure Al. The above complaint was referred to the police by the Magistrate, invoking section 156(3) of Cr.P.C.and crime was registered. After investigation, Annexure AQ final report was filed. 3. The petitioner herein, contending that it is an absolutely false case and that he is sought to be falsely implicated, has sought to quash the entire proceedings. The father of the petitioner herein had purchased an item of property from the family of the third respondent and a house was constructed therein. It was contended that, the petitioner herein was the neighbour of the third respondent, who was leading a loose life. Subsequently, disputes relating to the property arose and O.S.No.205/2009 was filed by the father of the petitioner against the third respondent and her family members. Annexure A5 is the copy of the above plaint dated 26/5/2009. It was alleged in the plaint itself that the third respondent herein was leading a loose life . 4. In spite of service of notice of the Crl.M.C.on the third respondent, she had not chosen to contest the proceedings. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, learned Public Prosecutor and perused the records. 5. It was strenuously contended by the learned counsel for Peles Fal 2018/KER/704 Crl.M.C.No.4619/2017 3 the petitioner that, the entire facts disclosed that it was an absolutely false case, without any bona fides. It was contended that the complaint was highly belated. Even though it was alleged that, the petitioner committed rape of the third respondent in the year 2008 and that she delivered a baby on 15/3/2009, the complaint was laid only on 27/7/2009. This delay has not been explained. It was also alleged by her that, even when she was seven months' pregnant, she had suspicion that, the petitioner herein was trying to avoid her and to retract from the promise for marriage. Hence,it was disclosed to her mother and attempts were allegedly made to enter into a matrimonial relationship, by registering the marriage under the Special Marriage Act. Even though this attempt failed, the complaint was filed much later and the delay has not been explained by the third respondent cogently. 6. Of course, the third respondent has a case that though an application for registering the marriage under the Special Marriage Act was filed and notice given, it did not materialse. The petitioner herein has an explanation in Annexure A5 that, he was trapped into by signing such document at the instance of others, without knowing that the notice given was for an intended marriage with the third respondent herein. According to the petitioner herein, he never intended to marry the third respondent. 7. The specific allegation in the complaint was that, the petitioner herein committed rape of the third respondent on Peles Fal 2018/KER/704 Crl.M.C.No.4619/2017 4 specified dates and consequently, the child was born in the physical relationship with the third respondent. The petitioner had denied the paternity. In the course of the investigation, samples were drawn from the petitioner , child and the third respondent herein and sent for conducting DNA test. Annexure A3 is the report dated 15/2/2010 of the DNA test. By the above report, the petitioner herein was excluded from the paternity of the child. Records also reveal that, thereafter the third respondent herein gave statement that she had physical relationship with one Shiju Yohanan and the child was born out of that relationship. Accordingly, investigating agency conducted DNA test of Shiju Yohanan and the child. Annexure A4 is the report dated 15/10/2010 of the DNA test. That report indicates that, Shiju Yohanan also was excluded from the paternity of the child. The records also indicate that, thereafter, further statement of the third respondent was recorded in which she stated that she had physical relationship with the petitioner and Shiju Yohannan only. However, in the light of the exclusion of both the above persons from the paternity of the child, her version seems to be highly unreliable and lacks credibility. 8. The very fact that the third respondent herein made allegation of paternity against the petitioner herein and later against Shiju Yohannan and both of them were excluded from the paternity of the child,clearly militates against her case of rape. Peles Fal 2018/KER/704 Crl.M.C.No.4619/2017 5 This also shakes at the very root of the case set up by the third respondent and also makes her version weak and has lost its credibility. 9. In the above circumstances, contention of the third respondent that she was subjected to rape by the petitioner herein has to be clearly doubted. Learned counsel for the petitioner further pointed out that the third respondent, though alleged that she was raped in the year 2008 and a child was born in the year 2009, she was subjected to the medical examination after the complaint was laid. Annexure A8 is the medical report. It indicates that, there was evidence of recent sexual act. This also cast serious doubt on the case set up by the third respondent that she had physical relationship with the petitioner herein some time in the year 2008. 10. The entire materials on record clearly shows that, the third respondent has come up with absolutely false case. There are reasons to believe that it amounts to abuse of process of the court and the forum of legal adjudication cannot be permitted to be misused for such frivolous complaint. Even assuming that the petitioner had physical relationship, in the nature of the materials collected by the agency, it can only be deemed to be consensual sex. The criminal proceedings cannot be permitted to continue, to meet the ends of justice and hence, it is liable to be quashed without prejudice to the right of the petitioner herein to seek eet 2018/KER/704 Crl.M.C.No.4619/2017 6 appropriate relief against the third respondent, if he is so advised. Accordingly, the Crl.M.C.is allowed. All further proceedings in SC No.1518/2015 of the District and Sessions Court, Kollam arising from Crime No. 458/2009 of Ezhukon Police station stand quashed .
