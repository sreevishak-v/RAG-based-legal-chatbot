No.594/2025 (Crime No. 179/2025 of Chirayinkeezhu Police Station ) Petitioner/Accused No.1:- Santhosh R, aged 34 years, S/o Raveendran, residing at Vayalthittaveedu, Kambykkayam, Kuzhiyam Colony, Perunguzhi, Chirayinkeezhu, Thiruvananthapuram. By Advocates. Vinod Kumar S and Jiju S COUNTER PETITIONER:- State of Kerala represented by Station House officer, Chirayinkeezhu Police Station. By Public Prosecutor Dr T Geena Kumary This Crl.M.C. came up for hearing on 25/02/2025 and the court on 28-02-2025 passed the following : ORDER This is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail. 2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable under Sections 329(3), 115(2), 118(1), 110 and 74, r/w Section 3(5) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, and Crime No. 179/2025 of Chirayinkeezhu Police Station is registered against the petitioner arraying him as the 1* accused. 3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- Due to enmity, Criminal M.C.No.594/2025 1/5 on 06.02.2025 at about 11.45 p.m., accused Nos. 1 and 2 trespassed into the courtyard of the residence of the defacto complainant, situated near Arattukadavu Junction in Azhoor Village, and the 1 accused, by using a chopper, hacked towards the head of the defacto complainant, and when she obstructed the said act with her left hand, it fell upon her left palm, causing an injury. Thereafter, the 2\" accused, by using the chopper, hacked towards the son of the defacto complainant, and when the defacto complainant prevented the same, it fell upon her left palm, causing an injury, and at that time, the 1* accused pressed on the neck of the defacto complainant, and beat her on her shoulder and chest, and when the pregnant daughter of the defacto complainant intervened, the 1* accused slapped on her face and caught hold of her hair and pushed her down. 4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The Investigating Officer filed report opposing the anticipatory bail application. 5. Heard. Perused the records. 6. The only point to be considered is, whether an order of anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioner/ 1* accused. 7. The Point:- The petitioner / 1* accused along with the other accused are alleged to have trespassed into the courtyard of the residence of the defacto complainant, and attacked her and her family members, using a chopper, causing injuries. The motive of the alleged incident is, the enmity that Criminal M.C.No.594/2025 2/5 arouse when the defacto complainant wamed the 2 accused, when the 2\" accused tried to hide near her house. 8. According to the petitioner, he is innocent of the allegations levelled against him. It is submitted that, the petitioner and the defacto complainant are neighbours and there exists a property dispute between them, and due to that enmity, the present false complaint has been filed against the petitioner. 9. The magnitude of the offence alleged is grave. It is seen from the First Information Statement given by the defacto complainant that the petitioner/ 1* accused had hacked the defacto complainant on her head, which when prevented, fell upon her left hand, causing an injury, and pressed on her neck and had beaten on her shoulder and chest, and thereafter, slapped on the face of the pregnant daughter of the defacto complainant and pushed her down. It is seen from the body note in the first Information Statement that ,the left palm and wrist of the defacto complainant were seen dressed and there are swelling on both her shoulders and back. It is seen from the wound certificate appended with the report filed by the Investigating Officer that the defacto complainant sustained injury over the left hand, wound over the left forearm of 2 cm and multiple abrasions over the left palm. So there are corresponding injuries. It is stated in the report that the chopper used for the commission of the offence is recovered. So the prosecution has made out a prima facie case Criminal M.C.No.594/2025 3/5 against the petitioner / 1* accused and regarding the involvement of the petitioner / 1 accused in the alleged offence. It is stated in the report that the investigation is in its preliminary stage and the statement of more witnesses are to be recorded and more evidence is to be collected. Considering the facts stated in the report to the effect that the petitioner is involved in the offence, it appears that exceptional jurisdiction to grant a pre-arrest bail cannot be exercised in this case. 10. In Jai Prakash Singh v. State of Bihar and Another (2012 (4) SCC 379), the Honble Apex court has held that, an order of pre-arrest bail being an extra ordinary privilege, should be granted only in exceptional cases. It is settled in law that arrest should be the last option and it should be restricted to cases where arrest is imperative in the facts and circumstances of a case and consistent view is that the grant of anticipatory bail shall be restricted to exceptional circumstances. So it is clear that the power to grant anticipatory bail under section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita. is an exceptional power and should be exercised only in exceptional cases and not as a matter of course. Its object is to ensure that a person should not be harassed or humiliated in order to satisfy the grudge or personal vendetta of the complainant. [Reliance placed on the decision rendered by the Honble Apex Court in HDFC Bank Limited v. J.J. Mannan and Another (2010 (1) SCC 679); Srikant Upadhyay v. State of Bihar (2024 KHC Online 6137)]. In the Criminal M.C.No.594/2025 4/5 case at hand, I find no exceptional circumstance to exercise the exceptional power of granting anticipatory bail. 11. Considering the serious allegation against the petitioner and gravity of the offence, it appears that granting the petitioner with an order of anticipatory bail will adversely affect the investigation. If an order of anticipatory bail is granted, he is likely to influence the witnesses and tamper with the evidence. Considering all these aspects, this court is not inclined to grant an order of pre-arrest bail to the petitioner. In the result, this petition is dismissed. Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and pronounced by me in Open Court on this the 28\" day of February, 2025. Sd/- NAZEERA S.
