Criminal M.C.No. 595/2025 (Crime No. 57/2025 of Poonthura Police Station) Petitioner/Accused No 7 :- Suneer Muhammed A S aged 22 years S/o. Abdul Samad KK, TC 43/986 Paruthikuzhy Manacaud Thiruvananthapuram By Advocates:- Salini TS Counter Petitioner _:- State of Kerala represented by Station House Officer Poonthura Police Station By Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumari This Criminal M.C. is coming on for hearing on 25.02.2025 and the court on 28.02.2025 passed the following : ORDER This is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail. 2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable under Sections 189(2), 191(2), 296(b), 115(2), 118(1), 118(@) and 110, r/w Section 190 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, and Crime No. 57/2025 of Poonthura Police Station is registered against the petitioner arraying him as the 7 accused. 2 3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- On 14.01.2025 at about 11 p.m., at Paruthikkuzhi Junction in Muttathara Village, the accused, six in numbers, formed themselves into an unlawful assembly and assaulted the friend of defacto complainant. When the defacto complainant prevented the attack, the 1* accused uttered obscene words against him and fisted on his left cheek. Then, accused Nos. 2 to 5 uttered obscene words against the defacto complainant and fisted and kicked him all over his body. When the defacto complainant fell down, the 2 accused, by using a granite piece, hit him on his left eye, causing fracture to his bone, and again attempted to hit on his head, which was evaded by the defacto complainant. 4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The Investigating Officer filed report opposing the bail application. 5. Heard. Perused the records. 6. The only point to be considered is, whether pre-arrest bail can be granted to the petitioner/ 7\" accused. 7. The Point:- The defacto complainant is an autorickshaw driver. As per the allegations, while the defacto complainant was driving his autorickshaw, he had seen around six accused manhandling one Nazeeb, and when he interfered and obstructed the attack, the accused persons attacked the defacto complainant, causing injuries. 3 8. The petitioner submits that, he is a student, and his name is not in the First Information Report. It is submitted that, the petitioner is innocent of the allegations levelled against him and he has been falsely implicated in this case. 9. The magnitude of the offence alleged is grave. Allegedly, the defacto complainant was attacked by the accused persons when he obstructed the act of the accused persons in manhandling the friend of the defacto complainant. The specific overt act alleged against the petitioner / 7\" accused is that, he had abused the defacto complainant and fisted and hit him on various parts of his body. It is seen from the body note appended with the First Information Statement that, there was swelling on the left eye of the defacto complainant. The treatment certificate produced along with the report shows that the defacto complainant had sustained closed glob injury on the left eye and fracture to his posterolateral wall, floor of left orbit involving extracornal retro- orbital space. So, there is corresponding injuries. So, the prosecution has made out a prima facie case against the petitioner/ 7\" accused and regarding the involvement of the petitioner in the alleged offence. It is stated in the report that the 6\" accused is yet to be arrested. The investigation is progressing. Considering the facts stated in the report to the effect that the petitioner is involved in the offence, it appears that exceptional jurisdiction to grant a pre- arrest bail cannot be exercised in this case. 4 10. In Jai Prakash Singh v. State of Bihar and Another (2012 (4) SCC 379), the Honble Apex court has held that, an order of pre-arrest bail being an extra ordinary privilege, should be granted only in exceptional cases. It is settled in law that arrest should be the last option and it should be restricted to cases where arrest is imperative in the facts and circumstances of a case and consistent view is that the grant of anticipatory bail shall be restricted to exceptional circumstances. So it is clear that the power to grant anticipatory bail under section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita is an exceptional power and should be exercised only in exceptional cases and not as a matter of course. Its object is to ensure that a person should not be harassed or humiliated in order to satisfy the grudge or personal vendetta of the complainant. [Reliance placed on the decision rendered by the Honble Apex Court in HDFC Bank Limited v. J.J. Mannan and Another (2010 (1) SCC 679); Srikant Upadhyay v. State of Bihar (2024 KHC Online 6137)]. In the case at hand, I find no exceptional circumstance to exercise the exceptional power of granting anticipatory bail. 11. Considering the serious allegation against the petitioner and gravity of the offence, it appears that granting the petitioner with an order of anticipatory bail will adversely affect the investigation. If an order of anticipatory bail is granted, he is likely to influence the witnesses and tamper 5 with the evidence. Considering all these aspects, this court is not inclined to grant an order of pre-arrest bail to the petitioner. In the result, this petition is dismissed.
