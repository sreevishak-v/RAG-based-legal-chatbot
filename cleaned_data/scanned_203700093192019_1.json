The application was dismissed vide Annexure-Al order dated 24.12.2019 for the reason that the accused has not been arrested so far, and that if the vehicle is released, there is remote chance for the accused to surrender before the court or to apprehend him. That apart, it was also observed that the vehicle could not be traced out and seized in case of any violation of condition imposed by the court and 2020/KER/284 Crl1.MC 9319/2019 3+ therefore ordered not to release the vehicle. The explanation given by the learned tItIIrd Addl. Sessions Judge, sitting as a vacation Judge, does not appear to be very reasonable because no purpose would be served by letting the vehicle to _ be damaged exposing it to sun and rain. It is submitted by the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner/accused that the accused had obtained anticipatory bail and he has not yet been arrested. The concern of the court is only to realise the damage, if any, sustained due to the use of the vehicle belonging to the petitioner. According to the learned Senior Public Prosecutor, the Department has sustained a damage worth Rs.60,000/-. In view of the above, the petition to get the vehicle released is allowed on condition that the petitioner shall execute a bond for Rs.60,000/- (Rupees sixty thousand only) with two- solvent sureties each for the like amount to- the satisfaction of the trial court and also on deposit of Rs.60,000/- CRupees sixty thousand only) in cash 2020/KER/284 Cr1.MC 9319/2019 -4- before the trial court.
