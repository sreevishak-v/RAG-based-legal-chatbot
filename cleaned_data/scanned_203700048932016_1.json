The learned counsel for the petitioner has pointed out that the petitioner has undergone a surgery by way of Angioplasty on 13.07.2016 and he is on rest at Madurai. It has been pointed out that it will be tedious for him to travel all the way from Madurai to Kochi to attend the case, as he has to take rest for two more weeks. 3. At the same time, the learned Standing Counsel for the CBI has pointed out that three cases were scheduled for trial before the court below and the other two cases had to be adjourned since the accused absconded. In case the PEE 2016/KER/34131 CRL.M.C.No. 4893 of 2016 uoe present trial is adjourned, there would not be any work in the court below during that period. 4. Considering the circumstances pointed out by the learned counsel for the petitioner and the anguish expressed by him, this Court is of the view that the court below can be directed to grant exemption to the petitioner from personal appearance as far as practicable. As far as practicable, the court below shall grant exemption to the petitioner, liberally. His presence shall be insisted only on the dates on which his presence is actually required for identification in the case before the court below. The court below shall grant such accommodation to the petitioner as far as practicable. In the result, this Crl.M.C. is disposed of with the above direction. Sd/- B.
