The petitioner has sought for getting the prosecution proceedings against the petitioner quashed on two grounds. The first ground is that sanction of the Central Government, as contemplated under Section 15 of the Passports Act, has not been obtained and therefore, the prosecution proceedings shall not lie as far as the offence under the Passports Act is concerned. 3. AS per Section 15 of the Passports Act, no prosecution shall be instituted against any person in respect eee 2016/KER/33655 CRL.M.C.No. 628 of 2015 uoe of any offences under the Act, without the previous sanction of the Central Government. When it has come out that no sanction was obtained, the offence under the Passports Act will not lie and therefore, the same is liable to be quashed. 4. With regard to the offences under the IPC, the learned counsel for the petitioner has pointed out that at the time of the alleged commission of the offence, the petitioner was a juvenile. Hence, the petitioner can only be considered as a juvenile in conflict with law. Therefore, the matter has to be reported before the Juvenile Justice Board. The prosecution proceedings based on Annexure 2 final report in C.C.No.707/2011 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Karunagappally, as far as the petitioner is concerned, are liable to be quashed. In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and the prosecution proceedings based on Annexure 2 final report in C.C.No.707/2011 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Karunagappally, as far as the petitioner is concerned, Pre ao) apo 2016/KER/33655 CRL.M.C.No. 628 of 2015 3: are hereby quashed.
