Cri. M.C No. 26 of 2015 Dated this the 6\" day of January, 2015. ORDER The petitioners herein are the two accused in C.C No.1324/2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court - I, Kasaragod. Crime in this case was registered under Sections 341, 323, 324, 506(i) r/w 34 IPC on the complaint of one Vanish, S/o Kunhanna Moolya. The petitioners now seek orders quashing the prosecution on the ground that they and the de facto complainant have come to terms amicably out of court. The de facto complainant Vanish is the first respondent in this proceeding. He has filed affidavit to the effect that he has settled the dispute with the accused, and he has no grievance or complaint. I find that the parties have really come to terms. In such a situation, continuance of the prosecution will not serve any purpose, other than wasting the precious time of the court, because nobody will support the prosecution, if the case goes to trial. In the result, this petition is allowed. The prosecution against the petitioners in C.C. No.1324/2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court- I, Kasaragod will stand quashed under Section - ene mates 2015/KER/214 Cri. M.C No. 26 of 2015 2 482 Cr.P.C. Accordingly, the petitioners will stand released from prosecution, and the bail bond, if any, executed by them will stand discharged. P.UBAID, JUDGE sab"
