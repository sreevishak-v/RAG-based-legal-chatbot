M.C No. 6269 of 2013 Dated this the 01* day of January, 2014. ORDER Petitioners are the accused Nos. 1 to 3 in O.R No. 7/99 of Nelliampathy Forest Range. The offences alleged are punishable under Sections 27(1)(e)(iii) and (iv) of Kerala Forest Act. The Crl.M.C is filed seeking to quash Annexure-A charge sheet and all proceedings in C.C No. 60/10 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Alathur. 2. There are 12 accused in the crime. Accused Nos. 10 to 12 were acquitted by the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Alathur vide judgment dated 30.03.2007 in C.C No. 742/01. Subsequently, the accused Nos. 5, 7 and 8 faced the trial and were acquitted in C.C.No.191/07 on the file of the same court. It is submitted that out of the remaining accused, two of them are no more and one is in abroad. The learned Magistrate decided the case on merits vide Annexure-B and C judgments. The learned Magistrate observes that he is unable to accept the version of complainant that P7 statement was given by Ali voluntarily and in the manner deposed by him and complainant's witnesses. It is stated that there is no evidence to prove the alleged commission of tresspass into the forest area and removal of Rose wood timber by accused Nos. 2014/KER/60 Crl. M.C No. 6269 of 2013 3 10 to 12. The statement of accused No.10 which inculpates the accused was not admitted in evidence. For these reasons, the court found that A10 to 12 are not guilty of the offences charged against them. In Annexure-B judgment, the court observes that the accused except 10 to 12 are implicated as per confession of accused No.10. The learned Magistrate found that the confession is not admissible in evidence. For the same reason, the learned Magistrate in Annexure-C judgment found that there no other source to proceed against accused Nos. 5,7 and 8 and that confession of accused No.10 is not binding on accused Nos. 5, 7 and 8. In the light of Annexure-B and C judgment, the offences alleged against the petitioners are liable to be quashed. Since the other accused were acquitted, for the very same set of reasons, this Court is of the view that no purpose would be served by continuing the prosecution against the petitioner. Accordingly, Crl.M.C is disposed of quashing Annexure-A charge sheet and all proceedings in C.C No. 60/10 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Alathur. HARUN-UL-RASHID, JUDGE.
