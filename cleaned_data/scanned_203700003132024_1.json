V. SREEJA, PUBLIC PROSECUTOR THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 12.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING : Bal SrsieRs Tal BSN 2024/KER/2388 CRL.MC NO. 313 OF 2024 2 BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J. ~ GrLLM.C.No.313 of 2024 Dated this the 12\" day of January, 2024 ORDER Petitioner challenges Annexure A3 order in Crl.M.P.No.3002 of 2023 in Crl.A.No.93 of 2023 on the files of the Sessions Court, Thodupuzha. 2. By virtue of the impugned order, the learned Sessions Judge while suspending the sentence imposed upon the petitioner, directed deposit of 20% of the amount of fine/ compensation imposed by the trial court in S.T.No.20 of 2016 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-II, Thodupuzha. 3. Sri.Denny Varghese, the learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the direction to deposit 20% of the fine amount is too onerous a condition to be imposed under Section 148(1) of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short, 'the NI Act') as the petitioner, is a housewife having no income and therefore, it is impossible for her to raise the huge amount of more than 17 lakhs for complying with the direction. 4. I have heard Smt.Sreeja V., the learned Public Prosecutor as well. 5. The learned Sessions Judge has imposed only the minimum amount specified in Section 148(1) of the NI Act. In the decision in Surinder Singh Deswai v. Virender Gandhi [(2020) 2 SCC 514], the Supreme Court has observed that the object of the NI Act will be defeated Bal SrsieRs Tal BSN 2024/KER/2388 CRL.MC NO. 313 OF 2024 3 if unscrupulous drawers fails to pay the amount and drag the case for a long period. The purpose of providing a deposit of a percentage of the sum involved as a condition to suspend the sentence is a means to prevent the payees from being subjected to irreparable prejudice. 6. In the instant case, a perusal of Annexure Al judgment reveals that the petitioner is alleged to have stood as a guarantor to the chitty transaction of her husband who received more than Rs.55 lakhs under a chitty in the year 2013. For the last almost 9 years, no amounts allegedly due under the cheque have been paid by the petitioner. In such circumstances, I am of the view that the direction to pay 20% is reasonable and there is no infirmity with the impugned order. Being a housewife cannot be a reason to avoid the condition for payment. Since the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the time to pay the amounts will expire tomorrow (13.01.2024), I am of the view that taking note of the circumstances pointed out by the learned counsel, the time to deposit can be extended by a further sixty days from today. With the above observation, the Crl.M.C. is dismissed.
