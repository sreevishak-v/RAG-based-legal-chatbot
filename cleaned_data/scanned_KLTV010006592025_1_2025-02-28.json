Nos.277/2025,278/2025,285/2025,286/2025,287/2025 10 contentions in the bail applications and the prosecution cases respectively. The learned Public Prosecutor submitted that the concerned police station approached the higher police officials for transferring the investigation to State Crime Branch and therefore, any detailed investigation was not conducted into the allegations levelled in the various financial frauds alleged in the prosecution cases. The State Crime Branch has now taken over the investigation. 9. The learned prosecutor produced the reports of the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Crime Branch Economic Offences Wing, Thiruvananthapuram Unit to oppose the bail applications. 10. Having perused the reports of the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Crime Branch and after hearing the learned counsel for the petitioners and Public Prosecutor, it is revealed that a more or less similar allegations are levelled against the petitioners in all the cases and they are primafacie punishable uw/ss 406 and 420 r/w 34 of IPC. 11. It is informed that there are no materials in the CD as the SHO/IO did not conduct any detailed investigation in the past on the reason of awaiting Government orders pertaining to transfer the investigation to State Crime Branch due to the pendency of more than 100 similar FIRs. In short, there is no effective investigation by the S.H.O of two police stations into the allegations levelled against the petitioners to probe their exact role in the alleged misappropriation. Details of the criminal cases against the accused Crl. MC, Nos.277/2025,278/2025,285/2025,286/2025,287/2025 11 stands narrated in column No. 16 of the police reports. Having gone through the police reports, copy of FIR and FIS, there is no specific allegation about the siphoning of funds of the society for own use of the office bearers. Any report of the Registrar or Joint Registrar of the Co-operative Societies to find out any _ instances of misappropriation is not forming part of the police reports. Any inspection reports of any higher officials of the Co-operative Department is not forming part of the police report. Moreover, the allegations against the accused ought to reveal that the non-payment of the deposit money in the society is the dispute between the parties. Nature and gravity of the offences alleged against the petitioners ought to reveal that the same is not sufficient enough to place the petitioners under custody and provide a_ custodial interrogation. Having heard both sides and on perusal of the records, I do hold that the discretion of pre-arrest bail can be exercised in favour of the petitioners subject to conditions. Apart from that, the limited interrogation of the petitioners as contemplated under the dictum of the Honble Supreme Court in Sushila Agarwal v. State (NCT of Delhi), 2020 SCC Online SC 98, is sufficient to the facts of the case. 12. As far as a court considering a pre-arrest bail application is concerned, the dictum of the Honble Supreme Court in AIR 1980 SC 1632, Gurubaksh Singh Sibbia_ and Another V. _State of Punjab holds Ci. MC. Nos.277/2025,278/2025,285/2025,286/2025,287/2025 12 the legal position that appropriate conditions can be imposed under sub section 2 of S.438 of CrPC so as to ensure an uninterrupted investigation and the court can even incorporate conditions that in the event of the police, making out a case of a likely discovery u/s.27 of Evidence Act, the person who is granted with an anticipatory bail can be taken into police custody for facilitating such discovery. 13. On applying the above dictum to the facts of the case and after carefully hearing the learned counsel for the petitioners and public prosecutor, it is just and proper to allow the applications to grant pre-arrest bail to the petitioners on conditions to co-operate with the investigation. 14. In the result, these Criminal MCs are allowed subject to the conditions as follows:- (i) The petitioners/accused Nos.9, 10 & 11 in Crl.MC No.277/2025(Crime No.1440/2024); petitioners/accused Nos.9, 10 & 11 in Crl.MC No.278/2025(Crime No.1430/2024); petitioners/accused Nos.9, 10 & 11 in Crl.MC No.285/2025 (Crime No.1511/2024); petitioners/accused Nos.9, 10 & 11 in Crl.MC No.287/2025(Crime No.1514/2024) of Fort Police Station and petitioners/accused Nos.5, 6 & 7 in Crl.MC No.286/2025(Crime No.1070/2024) of Medical College police Ci.

Crl. MC. Nos.277/2025,278/2025,285/2025,286/2025,287/2025 14 (vi) In compliance with conditions No.(i) to (iii), the Investigating Officer is at liberty to interrogate the petitioners, take appropriate steps for recovery as provided under law and the following conditions will not stand as an embargo in the investigation and interrogation.
