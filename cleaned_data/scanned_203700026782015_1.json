TO JUDGE pk Biel 2015/KER/17603 P.UBAID, J. Crl. M.C No. 2678 of 2015 Dated this the 5\" day of May, 2015. ORDER The petitioners herein are the original accused Nos. 1 and 5 in C.C No.477 of 2011 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Hosdurg involving the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 323, 324 and 153(A) IPC. The other six accused faced trial before the learned Magistrate, and obtained a judgment of acquittal on 29.11.2014 when all the material witnesses including the first informant injured turned hostile to the prosecution in view of an amicable settlement made by the parties out of court. The case against the petitioners was split up and refiled as C.C No.3302 of 2014. They now seek orders quashing the prosecution on the ground of amicable settlement, and also on the ground that the very substratum of the prosecution case stands totally lost by the acquittal of the others, and continuance of prosecution against them will not serve any purpose. In such a situation, it is quite definite that the prosecution cannot in any manner improve the Dest) 2015/KER/17603 Cri. M.C No. 2678 of 2015 2 case and the witnesses also cannot in any manner help the prosecution, if the case against the petitioners goes to trial. In short, such proceeding will be a sheer waste of time. In the result, this petition is allowed. The prosecution against the petitioners in C.C No.3302 of 2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Hosdurg will stand quashed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Accordingly, the petitioners will stand released from prosecution. Sd/- P.UBAID, JUDGE sab"
