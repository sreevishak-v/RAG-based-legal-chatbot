ANNEXURE A3 TRUE COPY OF THE AFFIDAVIT SWORN BY THE 2ND RESPONDENT. RESPONDENTS' EXHIBITS: NIL //TRUE COPY// vgd PA TO JUDGE gl 2018/KER/258 SUNIL THOMAS, J. Dated this the 4\" day of January, 2018 ORDER The petitioner is the sole accused in C.C. No.1228/2017 of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Thaliparamba arising from Crime No.367/2017 of Sreekandapuram Police Station, Kannur for offence punishable under Section 498(A) of IPC. The allegation of the prosecution is that after the marriage of the petitioner with the 2\" respondent held on 30.05.2009, the 2\" respondent was subjected to matrimonial cruelty by the petitioner in connection with demand for dowry. Hence, she laid a complaint and crime was registered. After investigation final report was filed. Cognizance was taken and the matter is now pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Thaliparamba. 2. In the meanwhile, the petitioner has approached this Court with a prayer that in the light of the settlement arrived at between the parties, the parties are not interested in prosecuting the matter and the proceedings may be quashed. To substantiate the contention of the petitioner herein, he relied on Annexure A3 affidavit sworn to by the 2\" respondent. Learned counsel for the 2 respondent relied on the averments contained in the petition gl 2018/KER/258 Cri. M. C. No. 8482 of 2017 2 as well as in the affidavit and submitted that the matter has been settled. He also acknowledged the due execution of Annexure A3 affidavit. 3. The learned Public Prosecutor on_ instructions submitted that the parties have resolved their disputes and that they are living together. The petitioner is not seen involved in any other crime. 4. _ Having considered the fact that the dispute essentially arose from a matrimonial discord, | feel that continuation of further proceedings can only result in manifest injustice. Hence, | am inclined to invoke the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to quash the entire proceedings. Accordingly, Crl.M.C. is allowed. All further proceedings in C.C. No.1228/2017 of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Thaliparamba stand quashed. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE. Pn"
