V. SREEJA (PP) THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 09.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Eel 2024/KER/4656 CRL.MC_143/2024 2 BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J area ORDER Petitioner challenges the proceedings in C.C.1417/2021 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Pala alleging offences punishable under Section 406, 420, 417, 468, 471 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Petitioner is the first accused in the said crime. 2. According to the prosecution, petitioner had misused the general power of attorney given by the de facto complainant and, on that basis, transferred 1/4\" right of the de facto complainant to the second accused, apart from creating other documents transferring properties to his wife, the second accused. Petitioner is also alleged to have forged the signature of the de facto complainant and canceled the power of attorney, and thereby committed the offences alleged. 3. Sri.M.P.Madhavankutty, the learned counsel for the petitioner, Eel BSR 2024/KER/4656 CRL.MC 143/2024 3 contended that the allegations against the 2! accused, who is the wife of the petitioner, has already been settled and the proceedings against her were quashed as per Annexure-VII judgment of this Court. It was further submitted that a civil suit filed by the de facto complainant against the petitioner and others were dismissed, and the appeal filed as R.F.A No.504/11 was also dismissed, as the matter was settled between the parties. However, since the petitioner was not available in station at that time the criminal case against the petitioner could not be settled. The learned counsel further submitted that prosecution allegations are not at all made out from the materials collected, and therefore, the continuance of the proceedings before the trial court is an abuse of the process of the court. It was also submitted that the case is based on a forged document, which was not even made part of the evidence collected during the investigation, and therefore the continuance of the proceedings before the trial court is a waste of time. 4. I have heard Smt.Sreeja v., the learned Public Prosecutor as Eel BSR 2024/KER/4656 CRL.MC 143/2024 4 well. 5. The prosecution allegation is that the accused had misused the power of attorney of his brother and transferred properties and also forged a deed of cancellation of the power of attorney executed in petitioners favour. It is also alleged that the accused carried out the same with an intention to cheat the de facto complainant, who is none other than the brother of the petitioner, who had allegedly entrusted the property to be managed while he was residing in the United States of America. 6. It is relevant to notice at this juncture that, even though the case against the 2\"4 accused has already been settled, the case against the petitioner has not yet been settled. 7. The contention of the petitioner that the material collected by the prosecution is not sufficient to bring home the guilt of the accused, it is a matter that can be agitated before the trial court in accordance with law. The scope of interference under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. is very limited. Unless the admitted allegations do not make out an offence as alleged, the remedy Eel ERE 2024/KER/4656 CRL.MC 143/2024 5 under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. cannot be invoked. 8. A perusal of the final report filed in C.C.1417/2021 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Pala, reveals that the admitted allegations definitely make out the ingredients of the offences alleged. A power of attorney issued to the petitioner is alleged to have been misused to transfer large extent of properties in favour of the wife of the petitioner. The offences alleged are serious in nature and the allegations if admitted do make out the crime as alleged. However, as mentioned above, if the materials collected are not sufficient to bring home a charge against the petitioner, definitely the remedy is elsewhere. 9. In such circumstances, the remedy under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. cannot be invoked. However, reserving the liberty of the petitioner to initiate appropriate proceedings as per the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973; this Crl.M.C. is dismissed. sd/- BECHU KURIAN THOMAS JUDGE AMV/11/01/2024 el isan! 2024/KER/4656 CRL.MC 1143/2024 6 APPENDIX OF CRL.MC 143/2024 PETITIONER ANNEXURES ANNEXURE -I A TRUE COPY OF THE COMPLAINT DATED 12- 01-2013 SUBMITTED BEFORE SUB INSPECTOR OF POLICE, PALA ANNEXURE -II A TRUE COPY OF THE FIR IN CRIME NO.57/2013 OF PALA POLICE STATION ANNEXURE -III THE CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT ANNEXURE -IV A TRUE COPY OF THE JUDGMENT IN 0.S.
