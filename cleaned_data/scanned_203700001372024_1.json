CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 12.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED- THE FOLLOWING: 2024/KER/2740 CRL.MC_137/2024 2 BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J arena ORDER Petitioner challenges the proceedings in C.C.No.1464/2021 on the files of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Nedumkandam, arising out of Crime No.197/2021 of Nedumkandam Police Station, registered for the offences punishable under Sections 188, 269, 271, 294(b), 506(1), 341, 353, 323, 332, 427 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and Sections 4(2)e r/w Section 3(a) the Kerala Epidemic Diseases Ordinance 2021. 2. According to the prosecution, on 29.04.2021 during a vehicle check, the accused failed to stop the vehicle, and thereafter, when the vehicle was found parked on the side of a road, the Police removed the same. On account of the said enmity the accused abused and threatened the de facto Baa 2024/KER/2740 CRL.MC 137/2024 3 complainant and other police officers, after blocking their vehicle and also assaulted them and, even tore the name plate from the uniform of the de facto complainant thereby committed the offences alleged. Since the 1 accused was violated the quarantine requirements of Covid-19 as he was suffering from the infection, the offences under Kerala Epidemic Diseases Ordinance 2021 was also attracted. 3. Sri.Sachithananda Pai, the learned counsel for the petitioners, submitted that the allegations are false and that the case against the petitioners has been lodged with a mala fide intent. It was further submitted that none of the offences alleged against the petitioners are made out, and hence the proceedings against the petitioners ought to be quashed. 4. Smt.Sreeja V., the learned Public Prosecutor, opposed the application and submitted that the nature of allegations as revealed from Annexure-1 final report indicates that appreciation of evidence is required, which can be done only after trial. Bante 2024/KER/2740 CRL.MC 137/2024 4 5. Petitioner is alleged to have abused the de facto complainant and other police officers and even tore the name plate from CW1. According to the prosecution, when the accused was found, during a vehicle check, roaming around in violation of Covid-19 restriction. He refused to stop the vehicle, and later the vehicle was found parked on the side of the road and was taken into custody. In retaliation, the accused assaulted the de facto complainant and other police officers and even tore the name plate of the police officers. Whether such allegations are true or false is a matter that can be appreciated only after adducing evidence. 6. It is settled that the remedy under Section 482 of Cr.P.C., cannot be invoked unless the admitted allegations do not make out any of the offences alleged. A reading of the allegations as seen in the final report indicates that the offences can be made out if those allegations are admitted. Therefore, it is only after trial can any court can appreciate whether those are proved or not. Thus Section 482 of Cr.P.C. is certainly not a remedy available to the petitioners. Beer eee RE eae 2024/KER/2740 CRL.MC 137/2024 5 Accordingly, I find no reason to quash the proceedings C.C.No.1464/2021 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Nedumkandam. This Crl.M.C., is dismissed. sd/- BECHU KURIAN THOMAS JUDGE AMV/12/01/2024 ae = nel 1 Be shea 2024/KER/2740 CRL.MC 137/2024 6 APPENDIX OF CRL.MC 137/2024 PETITIONER ANNEXURES ANNEXURE 1 CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT IN CRIME NO.197/2021 OF NEDUMKANDOM POLICE STATION TRUE COPY"
