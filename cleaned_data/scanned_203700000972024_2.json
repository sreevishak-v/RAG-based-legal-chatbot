NOUSHAD K.A. (PP) THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 22.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Bape as ral ahoh 2024/KER/7383 CRL.MC NO. 97 OF 2024 2 BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J. Crl.M.C.No.97 of 2024 Dated this the 22\" day of January 2024 ORDER Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.731/2022 of Kannur Police Station, Kannur alleging offences under various provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Stances Act, 1985. By Annexure Al order in B.A.No.5207/2022, this Court while granting bail to the petitioner in the aforementioned crime directed that he shall not involve in any other crime while on bail. In the meanwhile, petitioner is alleged to have involved in a serious offence, and is arrayed as 2 accused in Crime No.236/2023 of Valapttanam Police Station for the offences under Sections 392, 323, 364A and 365 r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. 2. In the latter case, which was allegedly committed while the petitioner was on bail, the prosecution alleged that the accused came in a motor car and after abducting the defacto complainant and his friends robbed their mobile phone and demanded ransom for its release. Immediately after commission of the second offence the Investigating Bape as ral ahoh 2024/KER/7383 CRL.MC NO. 97 OF 2024 3 Officer in Crime No.731/2022 filed Crl.M.P. No.537/2022 seeking cancellation of bail granted to the accused for violation of the conditions. By a detailed order dated 13.10.2023 produced as Annexure A Ill the learned Sessions Judge cancelled the bail after noticing that the allegations do not indicate any false implication and also that the nature of offence alleged against the accused includes abduction, robbery and demand of ransom, all of which are serious offences. 3. Sri.Aswanth.P.T., learned Counsel for the petitioner contended that the impugned order is not legally tenable, since the court had not considered various parameters for cancelling the bail. It is also submitted that the learned Sessions Judge while cancelling the bail failed to bear in mind the settled legal preposition that unless the liberty granted to the accused would prejudice the conduct of trial, bail ought not to be cancelled. The learned Counsel referring to the decision in Godson vs. State of Kerala 2022 ICO 1505 contended that the mere implication of the accused in the subsequent offence by itself ought not to be a ground for cancellation of bail. 4. Sri.K.A.Noushad, learned Public Prosecutor on the other hand contended that petitioner committed a serious offence, which has a tendency to interfere with the trial. as the accused had abducted the defacto complainant and demanded ramson, which can indirectly create fear and terror in the mind of the witnesses in the earlier case and thereby prejudice the trial and, if on that basis the bail is not cancelled 2024/KER/7383 CRL.MC NO. 97 OF 2024 4 the witnesses in the NDPS case may not come forward to give evidence. 5. Petitioner, though a young person of 24 years, is alleged to have involved in NDPS offence in Crime No.731/2022 of Kannur Town Police Station. He was released on bail by order dated 10.08.2022. Within five months thereafter, he is alleged to have involved himself in Crime No.226/2023 of Valapattanam Police Station by committing a serious offence of abduction and demand of ransom. 6. As rightly pointed out by the learned Public Prosecutor, the condition imposed in Annexure AI bail order is that, he shall not involve in any other crime while on bail. Despite such conditions having been imposed by this Court, petitioner involved in a crime of a serious nature like abduction and demand of ransom, certainly, it can spell out terror and fear in the mind of the witnesses, who are to be examined in Crime No.731/2022 of Kannur Town police Station. If in total disregard of the conditions, petitioner has committed the offence and if the bail is not cancelled, the trial in the said crime can be prejudiced. Therefore, the contention raised by the learned Counsel for the petitioner relying upon Godsons case (supra) is not legally tenable. 7. On a perusal of the impugned order and on considering the decision in P vs. State of M.P. [2022 (7) SCALE 411], it is noticed that the learned Sessions Judge has mentioned detailed reasons for cancelling the bail granted to the petitioner. It has also been specifically observed that there is no reason to assume that petitioner has been Bear i rte ISR a 2024/KER/7383 CRL.MC NO. 97 OF 2024 5 falsly implicated in the subsequent crime. 8. Having regard to the above circumstances, | do not find any perversity with the impugned order and it is hence liable to be interfered with. Accordingly, this Crl.M.C. is dismissed. sd/ BECHU KURIAN THOMAS JUDGE jm/ Bee PEE ena | Capes te 2024/KER/7383 CRL.MC NO. 97 OF 2024 6 APPENDIX OF CRL.MC 97/2024 PETITIONER ANNEXURES Annexure AI TRUE COPY OF THE HON'BLE HIGH COURT OF KERALA IN B.A.NO 5207/2022 DATED 10.08.2022 Annexure AIT THE TRUE COPY OF THE HON'BLE SESSIONS COURT, THALASSERY IN CRL.
