No. 4936 of 2016 Dated 3 August, 2016 ORDER 1.A tipper lorry bearing registration No.KL 22-C 813 was seized by the 1* respondent herein on the allegation that the said vehicle was used for transporting red earth. 2.A crime was registered as Crime No.302 of 2016 of Pothencode Police Station under Sections 4(1) read with Section 21 (1) of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 (hereinafter referred to as MMDR Act, 1957 and under Sections 420, 294(b), and 353 read with Section 34 of the IPC. 3.The petitioner had filed an application for getting the interim custody of the vehicle and the said application was allowed as per Annexure A order subject to various conditions. The petitioner is aggrieved by condition No. (b), (c) and (h) of Annexure Ai order. 4.Heard the rival submissions. Bil 2016/KER/33894 Crl.M.C. No.4936 of 2016 -2- 5.It is submitted by the learned counsel that the learned Magistrate relied on the judgment of this Court in Shan v. State of Kerala (2010 (3) KLT 413 [FB]) while imposing the onerous conditions. The learned counsel urges that the said judgment was rendered while dealing with vehicles seized under the provisions of the Kerala Protection of River Banks and Regulation of Removal of Sand Act, 2001. The learned counsel also relies on the judgment of this Court in Sasi v. State of Kerala (2013 (4) KLT 731) to contend that this Court has taken a view that the dictum of law laid down in Shan (supra) cannot be made applicable while considering the applications seeking interim custody of the vehicles seized invoking the provisions of the MMDR Act, 1957. Finally the learned counsel submits that the provisions of MMDR Act as well as the Kerala Minerals (Prevention of illegal Mining, Storage and Transportation) Rules, 2015 (hereinafter Bil 2016/KER/33894 Crl.M.C. No.4936 of 2016 -3- referred to as the Transportation Rules, 2015) were challenged before this Court and referring to the interim orders dated 1.9.2015 in W.A.1889 and 1890 of 2015 and also the order dated 14.6.2016 in W.A.1126 and 1129 of 2016, contends that the vehicles were ordered to be released subject to conditions and those conditions be imposed in the instant case as well. 6.Having regard to the facts and circumstances and taking note of the conditions imposed in the Writ Appeals, I am of the view that the condition imposed by the learned Magistrate can be suitably modified. In substitution of condition Nos. (b), (c) and (h), the learned Magistrate is directed to release the afore said vehicle on deposit of an amount of Rs.25,000/- and on _ condition that the petitioner executes a bond for Rs.25,000/- with two solvent sureties. The learned Magistrate is directed to impose appropriate conditions to prevent Bie eae rapes 2016/KER/33894 Crl.M.C. No.4936 of 2016 -4- alienation/transfer of the vehicle and subsequent production of the vehicle. 7.However, the conditions imposed as aforesaid will be subject to modification later, in terms of the final orders in the Writ Appeals, referred to in para 4 above. The 1* respondent will be at liberty to seek for modification without referring the matters to this Court and in that event the learned Magistrate is directed to pass appropriate orders in accordance with law. The petition is disposed off as above. Sd/- RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.YV., JUDGE kp/-3.8.16"
