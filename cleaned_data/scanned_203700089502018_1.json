OTHER PRESENT: R2 BY SRI E C BINEESH-PUBLIC PROSECUTOR THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 03.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: 2019/KER/170 Cri.MC.No. 8950 of 2018 -2- ORDER The petitioner was convicted and sentenced by the trial court under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, against which, the petitioner filed appeal. Along with the appeal, the petitioner filed Cr1.M.P.4548/2018 praying for suspending the execution of sentence awarded by the trial court. The court below as per Annexure-A3 order dated 12.12.2018 ordered to suspend the execution of sentence. The court below as per Annexure-A3 order inter alia directed the petitioner to deposit Rs.1 lakh before the trial court at the time of executing the 2019/KER/170 Cri.MC.No. 8950 of 2018 -3- bond. Aggrieved by the said direction, this Crl1.M.C. has been filed. 2. Heard. 3. The trial court sentenced the petitioner to simple imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs.10 lakh under Section 138 of the N.I.Act. Section 148 of the N.I.Act provides that notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, in an appeal by the drawer against conviction under Section 138, the Appellate Court may order the appellant to deposit such sum which shall be minimum of twenty per cent of the fine or compensation awarded by the trial court. In this case, the court below directed only to deposit 2019/KER/170 Crl.MC.No. 8950 of 2018 -4- Rs.1 lakh, which is only ten per cent of the compensation awarded by the trial court. In the said circumstances, I do not find anything to interfere with Annexure-A3 order passed by the appellate court. In the result, this Crl.M.C. stands dismissed. Sd/- B.
