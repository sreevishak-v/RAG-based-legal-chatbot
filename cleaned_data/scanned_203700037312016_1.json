RESPONDENT (S)' EXHIBITS : NIL. //TRUE COPY// P.A. TO JUDGE bp Dsl 2016/KER/33658 RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.Y, J Dated this the 1* day of August, 2016 ORDER 1.The petitioners herein are accused Nos.i to 6 in C.C.No.819 of 2013 on the files of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class Court-I, Hosdurg. They are charged for having committed offence punishable under sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 324, 326 read with 149 of the IPC. Respondents 3 to 5 are the victims. 2.The prosecution allegation is that on 2.8.2012 at 12.15 a.m., the petitioners formed themselves into an unlawful assembly and assaulted respondents 2 to 5 with sticks and other weapons and caused injuries. 3.Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners, respondents as well as the learned Public Prosecutor. 4.It is submitted that the parties have reached an out of Dsl 2016/KER/33658 Crl.M.C.3731/2016 2 court settlement and there is no acrimony between them at present. All the disputes have been amicably resolved and they desire to live in peace and _ harmony. Respondents 2, 3, 4 and 5 have sworn to separate affidavits wherein they assert that they have no objection in terminating the proceedings. 5.The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submits that the petitioners are not persons with criminal antecedents. 6.It is thus borne out from the submissions made at the bar that the parties have amicably settled their disputes by their own free will and without any kind of pressure, influence or coercion. The compromise, it is felt, is voluntarily and genuine and can be acted upon. 7.In_Gian Singh v. State of Punjab (2012) 10 SCC 303), Apex Court has held that in appropriate cases, the High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an Dsl 2016/KER/33658 Crl.M.C.3731/2016 3 end to the criminal proceedings. This view was reiterated in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab (2014) 6 SCC 466) and Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State of Jharkhand and Another (2014 (9) SCC 653). 8.After having heard the submissions of the learned Counsel and on perusing the records, it appears that the offences are entirely personal in nature and do not affect public peace or tranquility. It is also felt that quashing of proceedings on account of compromise would bring about peace. In a case such as the instant one, even if the prosecution is allowed to continue, it would not serve any purpose as the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak. It can only result in putting the de _ facto complainant and the accused to unwanted oppression and prejudice. Settlement will augur well for the interest of the community and will enable the parties to live in peace and harmony. In the result, this petition is allowed. All further BGS 2016/KER/33658 Crl.M.C.3731/2016 4 proceedings against the petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 to 6 in C.C.No.819 of 2013 on the files of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class Court-I, Hosdurg shall stand quashed.
