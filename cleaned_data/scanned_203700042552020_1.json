CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 04.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: BRE baeaenees Crl.MC.No.4255 OF 2020 (B) 2 202 KERIAT ORDER The accused came up to quash the FIR registered on the allegation of malpractice committed by the accused in transferring the interest of the defacto complainant over the management of a school in favour of a third person, under the guise of a power of attorney (R2(b)) alleged to have been executed by the defacto complainant. A mere perusal of the power of attorney would show that it is only a special power of attorney given only for the purpose of managing the affairs of the school. No right of transfer or alienation given under the power of attorney. This would show what is behind it. The alleged act of the accused would prima facie satisfy the ingredient which would constitute the offence alleged. Hence, there is no ground for exhausting the inherent power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. Cr1.M.C. is dismissed accordingly. Sd/- P.
