RESPONDENT (S)' EXHIBITS:NIL True Copy / P A to Judge Bip ap 2017/KER/49775 SUNIL THOMAS, J. Crl.M.C.No.7934 of 2017 Dated this the 8 day of December, 2017 ORDER Petitioner is arrayed as the sole accused in S.C.No.42 of 2017 of Sessions Court, Alappuzha arising from Crime No.1108 of 2011 of Kayamkulam Police Station for offences punishable under sections 447, 323 and 354 of the Indian Penal Code. 2. The genesis of the above crime is attributed to an incident that happened on 27.09.2011. It was alleged that, on that day, at about 7 p.m., petitioner allegedly trespassed into the house of the de facto complainant and assaulted the de facto complainant and another person. Crime was registered and after investigation, final report was laid. 3. Petitioner has approached this Court contending that the disputes have now been amicably settled. The second respondent has filed an affidavit as Annexure-A2 and the third respondent, who is the victim, has filed Annexure-A3 affidavit affirming the settlement. It is asserted by the deponent that the complaint was given on a mistaken impression and under compelling circumstances. It is further stated that the parties have now amicably settled the subject matter of the case and that, they have no existing grievance against the petitioners. Hence, they sought Bel 2017/KER/49775 Crl.M.C.7934/17 2 for quashing the proceedings. A. Learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted that the statement of the de facto complainant was recorded, who has conveyed about the settlement. There is nothing on record to show that the petitioner herein is involved in any other crime. It appears that the conduct of the petitioner herein has been condoned by the victims. Having considered the mutual settlement now arrived at between the parties, I feel that, no purpose will be served by prosecuting the petitioners herein. Hence, it is a fit case in which the jurisdiction under section 482 Cr.P.C can be invoked. In the result, Crl.M.C is allowed. All further proceedings in S.C.No.42 of 2017 of Sessions Court, Alappuzha arising from Crime No.1108 of 2011 of Kayamkulam Police Station will stand quashed.
