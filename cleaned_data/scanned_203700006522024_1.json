Learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that the petitioner is a 71 year old man, and so trial of the case has to be expedited for disposing it on an early date. 3. Learned Public Prosecutor would point out that the sessions case is of the year 2023 and so, the trial court may not be able to give an early posting for this case, superseding the old cases pending consideration of that court. 4. Since the petitioner is aged 71 years, the trial court has to see whether any priority can be given to that case for disposal on an early date, as he is a senior citizen. eae serait Crl.M.C.No.652/2024 3 D024/KERIA916 Hence, directing the trial court to consider the request of the petitioner (A5) for early disposal of SC No.682 of 2023, this Crl.M.C. is disposed of.
