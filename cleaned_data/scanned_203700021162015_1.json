No.2116 of 2015 Dated this the 21\" day of April, 2015. ORDER The petitioner is the fourth accused in NDPS Crime No.2/2014 of Excise Range, Erattupetta. The prosecution case is that the accused Nos.l1 to 3 were selling Ganja in an autorikshaw owned and possessed by the petitioner and when the Excise party came, they ran away. The respondent took custody of the vehicle along with 50 grams of Ganja in it and thereafter the vehicle is being kept idle in the premises of the Erattupetta Police Station. The petitioner filed CMP No.3511/2014 under Section 451 of the Cr.P.C. for getting interim custody of the vehicle. The respondent objected the said application on the allegation that the petitioner is a habitual offender and if the autorikshaw is released to the petitioner he will again commit the very same offence. The legality and propriety of the findings whereby the court below 2015/KER/17253 Crl.M.C.2116/15-B 22: rejected the application under Section 451 of the Cr.P.C. is under challenge in this Cr1.M.C. 2. The learned counsel for the petitioner advanced arguments challenging the findings whereby the court below declined the grant of interim custody. 3. Per contra, the learned Public Prosecutor advanced arguments to justify the denial of the interim custody. 4. Going by the impugned order it is seen that the application for interim custody was dismissed on the sole reason that the petitioner is a habitual offender involved in several crimes. But the particulars of the said offences, in which he was allegedly involved, are not stated in the impugned order. Indisputably, the vehicle is being kept idle in the premises of the police station in a position exposed to sunlight and rain and the vehicle will be ruined, if it is allowed to be kept as such. In the absence of the particulars of the offences, in which the petitioner is said to have involved, he cannot be treated as a habitual offender, Pee aaa 2015/KER/17253 Crl.M.C.2116/15-B 3: who used the above said autorikshaw for the commission of any other offence. In this analysis, I am of the view that no purpose will be served by keeping the autorikshaw in the police custody ina way subject to speedy and natural decay. The said view is supported by the decision of the Apex Court in Sunderbhai Ambalal Desai v. State of Gujrat [AIR (2002) 10 SC 290]. Therefore, I am inclined to grant interim custody of the vehicle to the petitioner subject to the following conditions: (1)The petitioner shall furnish Bank Guarantee for the value of the vehicle, which is to be determined by the competent authority. (2)The petitioner shall produce the vehicle before the concerned Magistrate's court as and when required. (3)In the event of failure to produce the vehicle, the court below is allowed to encash the Bank Guarantee. This petition is allowed. Sd/- (K.HARILAL, JUDGE) okb."
