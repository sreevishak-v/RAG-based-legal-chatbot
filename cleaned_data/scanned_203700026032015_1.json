ANNEXURE-2: THE TRUE COPY OF THE CHARGE SHEET DATED 14.1.2015. RESPONDENT(SY EXHIBITS: NIL TRUE COPY PS.TO JUDGE dsn . 2015/KER/17452 ANIL K.NARENDRAN, J ORDER The petitioner is the accused in Crime No.1539 of 2014 of Ernakulam Central Police Station, which is now pending as C.C.No.30 of 2015 on the file of the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Ernakulam. The offence alleged against the petitioner is punishable under Sections 468 and 471 of IPC. The grievance of the petitioner is that, the Magistrate Court has already issued non-bailable warrant against him and if he surrenders before the Magistrate Court there is every likelihood of the application not being considered on the very same day. Therefore, the petitioner seeks a direction to consider his bail application on the day of surrender itself. 2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor. 3. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, this CrI.M.C. is disposed of directing the petitioner to surrender before the Magistrate Court within a period of two weeks from today and ce ie 2015/KER/17452 Crl.M.C.No.2603/15 ~2- the Magistrate Court is further directed to consider his bail application on the day of surrender itself, strictly in accordance with law. The non-bailable warrant already issued against the petitioner shall be kept in abeyance for a period of two weeks. The Crl.M.C. is disposed of as above. Sd/- ANIL K.NARENDRAN, JUDGE dsn"
