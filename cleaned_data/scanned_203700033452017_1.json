CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 08.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Peli Oa Crl.MC.No.3345 OF 2017 202 1/KER/T226 2 ORDER Dated this the 8th day of January 2021 This Crl.M.C. under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is filed to quash all further proceedings in Crime No.209/2017 of Nilamboor Police Station. The above case is registered against the petitioner alleging offences punishable under Sections 324 and 308 read with Section 34 of the IPC. 2. The prosecution case in brief is that on 02.05.2017 at 8 p.m., the accused assaulted the defacto complainant in this case and he sustained injury. 3. When this case came up for consideration the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the entire dispute between the petitioner and the 1** respondent are settled out of court. A lawyer is also appeared for the 15* respondent. The learned counsel for the 1** respondent also submitted that the entire dispute are settled out of court. Annexure A2 is an affidavit filed by Eee Crl.MC.No.3345 OF 2017 202 1/KER/T226 3 the 1** respondent. 4. The learned Public Prosecutor also submitted that he has no objection in quashing the proceedings. 5. Having considered the gravity of the offences alleged, nature of the injury caused and having perused the affidavit filed by the i1* respondent, the contents of which are submitted to be true and voluntary, I am satisfied that the matter has been amicably settled and that no public interest is involved in this matter. Moreover, in view of the settlement arrived at between the parties, there is no possibility of the criminal proceedings ending in conviction. As such, continuance of the proceedings will amount to an abuse of process of court and hence, in view of the legal position set out by the Honourable Supreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is no impediment in granting the relief. Pelige | CHE amen Crl.MC.No.3345 OF 2017 202UKER/1226 4 Therefore, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and all further proceedings consequent to Crime No.209/2017 of Nilamboor Police Station are quashed.
