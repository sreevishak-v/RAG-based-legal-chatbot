RESPONDENT'S ANNEXURES:- NIL. ITTRUE COPY// P.S. TO JUDGE rs 2016/KER/33887 RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN V., J. ~ Cri. M.C. No.4781 of 2016 Dated this the 3\" day of August, 2016 ORDER 1.The petitioner herein is the accused in Crime No. 4 of 2016 of Thrissur Excise Range. The aforesaid crime has been registered alleging offence punishable under Section 20(b) ii(B) of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. The prosecution allegation is that the petitioner was found in possession of 1.200 kg of dry Ganja which was kept for the purpose of sale. 2.The petitioner was arrested on 23.4.2016 and his application for bail was allowed by Annexure-A order. He was directed to execute a bond for Rs.50,000/- with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the Sessions Judge and the sureties were also directed to produce their title deeds before the court at the time of executing the bond. The aforesaid order was passed on 21.06.2016. 2016/KER/33887 Cri. M.C. No.4781 of 2016 2 3.The petitioner immediately approached this Court and filed Cril.M.C. No.4501 of 2016 with a prayer to permit him to deposit the bond amount in cash. According to him, he was not in a position to produce solvent sureties to the satisfaction of the court below. The aforesaid application was disposed of on 19.7.2016 directing the petitioner to file an application before the court below. 4.It appears that even prior to passing of Annexure C order the petitioner had approached the learned Sessions Judge and had sought for the same relief, but his prayer was rejected by Annexure C order dated 13.7.2016 on the ground that there is every chance for absconding. 5. Heard the learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner as well as learned Public Prosecutor. 6.The learned Counsel would submit that Section 445 of the Code specifically enables the accused to deposit 2016/KER/33887 Cri. M.C. No.4781 of 2016 3 cash in circumstances where the sureties may not be available. It is asserted that he was arrested on 23.4.2016 and has not been able to secure his release in spite of Annexure-A order which is dated 21.6.2016. The learned counsel also submits that the petitioner has a permanent place of abode in Tamil Nadu and the investigating officer was convinced of this fact. The learned counsel also submits that he is prepared to execute a bond with two sureties from his place of abode and also to deposit the bond amount. There is no chance for the petitioner evading from the process of law. 7.The learned Public Prosecutor on the other hand opposed the submission and submits that the petitioner will not be available for trial if sufficient safeguards are not put in place. 8.I have bestowed my anxious consideration to the rival submissions. I take note of the submission of the a ret Bina 2016/KER/33887 Crl. M.C. No.4781 of 2016 4 learned counsel that the petitioner has amassed the bond amount to comply with the stipulations in Section 445 of the Code. I am of the view that appropriate stringent conditions can be imposed to safeguard the interest of the prosecution. The petitioner can also be directed to produce two sureties who shall execute the bond to the satisfaction of the court. 9.Having regard to the facts and_ circumstances, Annexure-C order is set aside. The learned Sessions Judge is directed to release the petitioner on bail on the petitioner complying with the following conditions: a. In substitution of the earlier bond amount of Rs.1,00,000/-, the petitioner shall deposit a sum of Rs.1,50,000/- and also execute a bond with two sureties. b. The petitioner as well his sureties shall produce authentic records to prove their residence and nativity in the State of Tamil Nadu or elsewhere along with proper identification cards to the satisfaction of the court below. a ret Bina 2016/KER/33887 Crl. M.C. No.4781 of 2016 5 c. If the learned Public Prosecutor entertains any doubt with regard to the authenticity and genuineness of the documents, he shall be at liberty to make enquiries through the investigating officer and to place a report before the Sessions Judge. d. The learned Sessions Judge will be at liberty to cancel the bail, if any granted, without referring the matter to this Court in accordance with law. e. All the other conditions imposed in Annexure-A order shall remain as such. The petition is disposed off. Sd/- RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN V. JUDGE SKV"
