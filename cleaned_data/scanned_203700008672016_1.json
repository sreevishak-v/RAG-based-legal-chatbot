KEMAL PASHA, J. Dated this the 4\" day of January, 2018 ORDER Petitioner is the accused in CC No.627/2015 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-ll, Ernakulam, based on Annexure-B final report in Crime No.2536/2014 of Ernakulam Central Police Station for the offence punishable under Section 135(1)(e) of the Indian Electricity Act (Amendment) 2003. The allegation against the petitioner is that he has made use of the electricity obtained by him in a domestic connection for commercial purpose, thereby causing wrongful loss of %40,740/- to the Kerala State Electricity Board. 2. It has come out that the entire amount of ~40,740/- has been paid by the petitioner. The petitioner ree ape 2018/KER/237 Crl.M.C.867/2016 :2: had approached the Kerala State Electricity Appellate Authority and filed an appeal against the action initiated by the KSEB against him. By Annexure-C order, the proceedings initiated against the petitioner through the final assessment order dated 06.12.2014, was set aside by the Appellate Authority. In Annexure-C order, the Appellate Authority has observed thai- The action of the appellant would have fallen under dishonest intention, if a higher tariff electric connection existed in this premises. No case of any tampering of meter has been recorded in the site mahazar. The allegation of dishonest intention against the appellant has not been established by the respondent either in the site mahazar or through any other evidence. Hence, the action of the appellant is not falling under the purview of Section 135 of Electricity Act 2003 (amended in 2007) and the action taken by the respondent is quite unfair and unsustainable. 3. According to the learned Standing Counsel for 2018/KER/237 Crl.M.C.867/2016 4. the KSEB, Annexure-C proceedings are independent proceedings and it cannot have any bearing on the criminal action relating to the offence committed. At the same time, it seems that through Annexure-C order, the Appellate Authority has found that no offence has been made out under Section 135 of the Indian Electricity Act. The Appellate Authority has in categorical terms declared that there was no dishonest intention on the part of the petitioner in making use of the said electricity connection for commercial purpose. When the Appellate Authority of the Kerala State Electricity Board itself has found that there are no elements to invite an offence under Section 135 of the Indian Electricity Act, and especially when the amount assessed has been paid by the petitioner, the continued prosecution will not yield any fruitful result. Matters being so, all further proceedings against the petitioner in CC No.627/2015 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-ll, Ernakulam, which has arisen from Crime No.2536/2014 of Ernakulam Central ree seat Cea 4 aR 2018/KER/237 Crl.M.C.867/2016 4: Police Station, can be quashed. In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and all further proceedings against the petitioner in CC No.627/2015 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-ll, Ernakulam, which has arisen from Crime No.2536/2014 of Ernakulam Central Police Station, are quashed.
