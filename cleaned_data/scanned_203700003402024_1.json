REPRESENTED BY MOTHER SUJA, PIN - 680505 THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 12.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: 2024/KER/2545 CRL.MC NO.340 OF 2024 3 ORDER Dated this the 12\" day of January , 2024 This Crl.M.C., under Section 482 of Cr.P.C., is at the instance of the respondent in M.C.No.149 of 2022 on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Chavakkad, impugning the order dated 02.09.2023 in Crl.M.P.No.3728 of 2023. 2. Learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that his wife and children filed M.C.No.149 of 2022 against him, under Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, (hereinafter referred as the D.V.Act) and obtained Annexure A3 order, in which he was restrained from committing domestic violence against them, and from dispossessing them from the - scheduled property. Subsequently, his wife and children filed Annexure A4 violation petition against him, alleging that on 18.05.2023, he abused and threatened them in violation of Annexure A3 protection order. Learned Magistrate as per Annexure ENSANre 2024/KER/2545 CRL.MC NO.340 OF 2024 A5 order, took cognizance under Section 31 of the D.V. Act, and S.T.No.2670 of 2023 was taken on file against him, and he is challenging that order. 3. On going through Annexure A5 order dated 02.09.2023, it could be seen that, after hearing the petitioners in Crl.M.P.No.3728 of 2023, and on perusing the report of the Protection Officer, learned Magistrate was satisfied that sufficient grounds were there to proceed against the respondent/husband under Section 31 of the D.V. Act, and so, S.T.No.2670 of 2023 was taken on file against him. 4. The petitioner herein, is having every right and opportunity to defend his case in S.T.No.2670 of 2023 by adducing evidence. Without taking such a course, his prayer is to quash Annexure A5 order, even before the parties could venture into prove or disprove their allegations and counter allegations. On receipt of Annexure A4 violation petition, the petitioners therein were Bees 2024/KER/2545 CRL.MC NO.340 OF 2024 5 heard, and the report of the Protection Officer was verified, and on prima facie satisfaction of violation of the protection order, learned Magistrate took cognizance under Section 31 of the D.V. Act and, S.T.No.2670 of 2023 was taken on file against him. This Court finds no illegality or impropriety in the impugned order and hence the Crl.M.C. is liable to be dismissed. In the result, this Crl.M.C. is dismissed and the learned Magistrate is directed to dispose S.T.No.2670 of 2023 as early as possible, at any rate, within a period of two months from today, on affording opportunity to both parties to adduce their evidence, if any.
