CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 09.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: 2024/KER/1158 CRL.MC NO. 161 OF 2024 2 BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J. ~ GrLLM.C.No.161 of 2024 Dated this the 9 day of January, 2024 ORDER Petitioner is aggrieved by condition No.1 imposed in the order dated 15.12.2023 in Cri.M.P.No.8199 of 2023 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-II, Neyyattinkara. As per the said condition, while directing release of a tipper lorry bearing Registration No.KL-20-F- 9404, on interim custody under Section 457 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, the learned Magistrate has directed a cash deposit of Rs.1,60,000/- which is stated to be equivalent to the value of the vehicle and also to execute a bond for the said amount with two solvent sureties. 2. After hearing Sri.Govind R., the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as Smt.Sreeja V., the learned Public Prosecutor, I am of the view that the condition directing deposit of cash security for releasing a vehicle involved in an alleged illegal transportation of ordinary earth in violation of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 is too onerous a condition. Since the learned Magistrate has also imposed a condition to furnish a bond with two solvent sureties, I am of the view that the security in the form of a property or a bank guarantee, equivalent to the value of the vehicle would suffice. 3. Therefore, condition No.1 directing deposit of cash security of Rs.1,60,000/- in the order dated 15.12.2023 in Crl.M.P.No.8199 of 2023 Bee sare BSR ar 2024/KER/1158 CRL.MC NO. 161 OF 2024 3 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-II, Neyyattinkara shall stand modified and the petitioner is permitted to furnish security either in the form of a property of equivalent value or a bank guarantee to the satisfaction of the learned Magistrate. The Crl.M.C.is disposed of with the above modification to Annexure A2.
