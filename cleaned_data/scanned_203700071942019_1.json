BY ADVS. SRI.C.D.JOHNY SRI.LIFFY P. FRANCIS RESPONDENT: STATE OF KERALA, REPRESENTED BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR, HIGH COURT OF KERALA AT ERNAKULAM. RAMESH CHAND-PP THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 06.01.2020, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: oe 2020/KER/104 Crl.MC.No.7194 OF 2019 (H) 2 ORDER Dated this the 6th day of January 2020 The petitioner is an accused in Crime No.897/2019 of Nedumbassery Police Station, for having allegedly committed offences punishable under Sections 468 and 471 of the IPC and r/w Section 12(1)(b) of the Passport Act. 2. Vide order dated 27.08.2019, the petitioner was granted bail by the Sessions Court on certain conditions. The petitioner has been following the conditions so far. The petitioner filed a Crl.M.P.2384/2019 before the Sessions Court for modifying the condition Nos.3 and 7, but the same was rejected by the court. Condition Nos.3 and 7 reads thus: 3. The petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer on every Saturday between 9 a.m. andi10a.m, till the final oe 2020/KER/104 Crl.MC.No.7194 OF 2019 (H) 3 report is filed. 7. The petitioner shall not leave Ernakulam District without getting prior permission of this court. 3. The petitioner hails from Punjab, and finds it difficult to appear before the investigating officer on every Saturday between 9 a.m and 10 a.m as required in condition No.3. Condition No.7 also insist that he shall not leave Ernakulam without getting permission of the court. 4. The petitioner has approached this Court stating that, the order of the Sessions Court at Annexure-Al specifically states that, no offence under Section 468 of the IPC is attracted. If that being so what is attracted is only non bailable offence and imposing of such conditions to appear before the investigating officer every week and creating oe 2020/KER/104 Crl.MC.No.7194 OF 2019 (H) 4 an embargo on leaving the district would amount to refusal of the bail and therefore, such conditions cannot be imposed in a bailable offence. 5. Heard learned counsel appearing for the petitioner and the learned senior Public Prosecutor. 6. The petitioner hails from Punjab, and on the apprehension that he may not be available for trial, the court imposed certain conditions while granting him bail. It is true that the court has expressed a view that Section 468 of the IPC may not be attracted considering the facts and circumstances of the case. However, the argument of the learned counsel that no conditions at all can be imposed where the offence is bailable is not acceptable to this Court. | 2020/KER/104 Crl.MC.No.7194 OF 2019 (H) 5 7. However, I find that the investigation has progressed well and the petitioner has been complying with the conditions so far without fail. The learned Public Prosecutor also submits that the investigation is almost complete and the final report will be filed within a short period. The conditions are also to be complied only till the final report is filed. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, I find that, the condition No.3 requiring the appearance of the petitioner before the investigating officer on every Saturday shall be relaxed and the petitioner shall hereinafter appear before the investigating officer once in two months. The condition No.7 preventing him from leaving Ernakulam District is also lifted. The i 2020/KER/104 Crl.MC.No.7194 OF 2019 (H) 6 investigating officer is directed file a final report expeditiously. The Crl.M.C is disposed of as above.
