Criminal M.C.No. 621/2025 Crime No 150/2025 of Aruvikkara Police Station Petitioner/Accused No. 9 :- K Satheesh Kumar aged 58 years S/o. T Santhakumari Amma SivamMundela P.O Aruvikkara Thiruvananthapuram 695543 By Advocates:- Sonay John, Soniya S Jobin , J Abraham R B Rahul Raj and Rohit R Counter Petitioners :- 1) State of Kerala 2) The Inspector, Aruvikkara Police Station Thiruvananthapuram By Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumari This Criminal M.C. is coming on for hearing on 03.03.2025 and the court on 04.03.2025 passed the following :: ORDER This is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail. 2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable under Sections 409 and 420, r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, and 2 Crime No. 150/2025 of Aruvikkara Police Station is registered against the petitioner arraying him as 9\" accused. 3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- The accused Nos. 1 to 7, who were the staff of Rajiv Gandhi Residents Welfare Co-operative Society situated in Nedumangadu Taluk, along with accused Nos. 8 to 16, in furtherance of their common intention to obtain wrongful gain and to cause wrongful loss to the depositors in the Society, during the period from 01.04.2021 to 31.05.2024, committed misappropriation in the deposits, and obtained a total sum of Rs.24,74,21,480/- from them. 4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The Investigating Officer filed report opposing the anticipatory bail application. 5. Heard. Perused the records. 6. The only point to be considered is, whether an order of anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioner/ 9\" accused. 7. The Point:- The defacto complainant was the Part-Time Administrator of Rajiv Gandhi Residents Welfare Co-operative Society. The prosecution allegation is that, the accused persons have committed misappropriation of around Rs.24,74,21,480/- by taking loans in benami names and by way of advance MDS. The specific allegation against petitioner / 9\" accused is that, he had pledged the property in his name as security for obtaining different loans and MDS. 3 8. The petitioner submits that, he is a farmer and is not involved in any offence, and his brother-in-law, M.Mohankumar, who is a well known political figure, was the President of Rajiv Gandhi Residents Welfare Co- operative Society, and he committed suicide, after being falsely accused of misappropriating funds from the said Society. It is submitted that, though more than 60 crimes have been registered against the office bearers of the Society based on various complaints, the petitioner is never named as an accused in any of those crimes, since he did not held any post in the said Society, but later, on 06.02.2025, the Aruvikkara Police registered an F.I.R. against the petitioner and 15 others, including some of his family members, alleging misappropriation of over Rs.24 Crores from the Society. It is also submitted that, the petitioner stood as a surety for one of the chitties in the Bank, and he has no connection with the functioning of the society and the alleged misappropriation of funds, and the present crime has been registered due to political vengeance. 9. The allegation against the petitioner is not grave. It is seen from the report filed by the Investigating Officer that, when a search was conducted in the Rajiv Gandhi Residents Welfare Co-operative Society, it was found that, using the property and suretyship of accused Nos. 8 to 16, they had availed various loans and chitties and obtained more than Rs.50 Lakhs in their names and in the benami names. It is stated in the bail application that the petitioner stood as a surety for one of the chitties in the Bank, and he has no connection 4 with the functioning of the Society and misappropriation of funds. Even if some documents were found in the name of the petitioner, the relevance of the same in the implication of the crime and the dishonest intention of the petitioner is a matter of evidence. The exact role of the petitioner is not brought out by the prosecution. It appears that there is no prima facie case against the petitioner. It would be a travesty of justice, if the petitioner is put behind the bars, if he has not committed any offence. No criminal antecedents of the petitioner is brought to the notice of this court. 10. In view of my discussion above, it appears that there is no impediment in granting a pre-arrest bail to the petitioner. Considering all these aspects, it is found that this is a fit case where a pre-arrest bail can be granted to the petitioner. In the result, the petition is allowed on the following conditions:- (1) In the event of arrest, the petitioner/ 9\" accused shall be released on bail on his executing bond for Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) with two solvent sureties for the like sum each to the satisfaction of the arresting officer/ Investigating Officer, as the case may be. (2) Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. on every Tuesday for a period of 3 (three) months or till the filing of the final report, whichever is earlier. (3) Petitioner shall also appear before the Investigating Officer as and when required. 5 (4) Petitioner shall not commit any offence while on bail. (5) Petitioner shall not attempt to contact the defacto complainant or any of the prosecution witnesses, directly or through any other person, or in any other way try to tamper with the evidence or influence any witnesses or other persons related to the investigation. In case of any violation of the above conditions or misuse of liberty, the prosecution or the defacto complainant is at liberty to approach jurisdictional court for cancellation of bail.
