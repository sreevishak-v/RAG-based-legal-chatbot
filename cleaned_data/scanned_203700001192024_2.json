Crl.M.C.No.119 of 2024 Dated this the 22\" day of January 2024 ORDER Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C to quash all proceedings against him. 2. Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.1493/2023 of Museum Police Station alleging offences under Section 379 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The 3% respondent is the defacto complainant. 3. According to the prosecution, the accused stole the motor cycle belonging to the defacto complainant bearing Reg.No. KL O1 AR 1450 and thereby committed the offences alleged. 4. Heard the learned Counsel for the petitioner and the learned Counsel for the respondent apart from the learned Public Prosecutor. 5. The learned Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the matter has been settled and hence the proceedings against the petitioner ought to be quashed. It was also submitted that, considering the nature of offences alleged, no purpose would be served by continuing the proceedings. 6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303], the Apex Court has held that in appropriate cases, the High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim 2024/KER/6448 CRL.MC NO.119 OF 2024 3 and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. This view was reiterated in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466] and Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State of Jharkhand and Another [(2014) 9 SCC 653]. 7. | have perused Annexure A2 affidavit filed by the 3\" respondent. The learned Public Prosecutor has submitted that upon verification, it is understood that the affidavit is genuine, and the defacto complainant stands by the contens thereof. Though the learned Public Prosecutor submitted that the petitioner is involved in another crime of identical nature considering the nature of settlement arrived at between the parties, | am of the view that no purpose would be achieved by continuing the investigation into the present crime. There is no impediment for granting the prayer for quashing. The continuance of the proceedings will only be an exercise in futility. 8. Accordingly, all proceedings against the petitioner in Crime No.1493/2023 of Museum Police Station are quashed. The Crl.M.C. is allowed.
