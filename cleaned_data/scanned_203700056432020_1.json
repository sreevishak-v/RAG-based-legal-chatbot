VIVEK.P.K OTHER PRESENT: SR.PP.C.S.HRITHWIK THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 07.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Dae Crl.MC.No.5643 OF 2020 (E) LoB.. 202 UKER/TII2 ORDER Dated this the 7th day of January 2021 Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.121/2016 registered at the Bakel Police Station for the offence punishable under Section 324 of IPC, now pending as C.C.No.17/2020 on the files of the Juvenile Justice Board, Kasaragod. The de facto complainant and the other persons injured are arrayed as respondents 3 to 6. Annexures A3 to A6 affidavits have been filed by the said respondents stating that the dispute, which was the reason for the incident and registration of the crime, has been resolved amicably and they have no subsisting grievance against the petitioners. 2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also, who, on instructions, submits that the petitioner has Dae Crl.MC.No.5643 OF 2020 (&) AL, 2021/KERITII2 no criminal antecedents. 3. Having considered the gravity of the offences alleged, nature of the injury caused and having perused the affidavits filed by respondents 3 to 6, the contents of which are submitted to be true and voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled and no public interest is involved in this matter. Moreover, in view of the settlement, possibility of the criminal proceedings ending in conviction is remote. As such, continuance of the proceedings will amount to an abuse of process of court and hence, in view of the legal position set out by the Honourable Supreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is no impediment in granting the relief sought. Le Dee Crl.MC.No.5643 OF 2020 (&) 5. 202 UKER/TII2 In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. The proceedings in C.C.No.17/2020 on the files of the Juvenile Justice Board, Kasaragod is quashed.
