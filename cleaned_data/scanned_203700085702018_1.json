BY ADV. SRI.SANTHOSH P.PODUVAL SRI AMJAD ALI-PP THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 07.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: = ae Breer Cr1.MC.No. 8570 of 2018 2 201/KERI666 ORDER This petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (the Code for brevity). 2. The 2 respondent is the de facto complainant in C.C. No.210 of 2015 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Ponnani. The petitioner herein is the husband of the 2 respondent and he is being proceeded against for having committed offence punishable under Sections 406, 498A, 506(ii) r/w. Section 34 of the IPC. 3. The instant petition is filed with a prayer to quash the proceedings on the ground of settlement of all disputes. The 2 respondent has filed an affidavit stating that she does not wish to continue with the prosecution proceedings against the petitioner. 4. |The learned Public Prosecutor has obtained instructions. He submitted that the statement of the 2\" respondent has been recorded Crl.MC.No. 8570 of 2018 3 2019/KERI666 and the State has no objection in terminating the proceedings as it involves no public interest. 5. Ihave considered the submissions advanced. 6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303] and in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466], the Apex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. Further in Jitendra Raghuvanshi & Others v. Babita Raghuvanshi & Another [(2013) 4 SCC 58], it was observed that it is the duty of the courts to encourage genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes. If the parties ponder over their faults and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual agreement instead of fighting it out in a court of law, the courts should not hesitate to exercise its powers under Section 482 of the Code. Permitting such proceedings to continue would be nothing, but an abuse of process of court. The interest of justice also require that the proceedings be quashed. Having Cr1.MC.No. 8570 of 2018 4 201/KERI666 considered all the relevant circumstances, I am of the considered view that this Court will be well justified in invoking its extraordinary powers under Section 482 of the Code to quash the proceedings. In the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-B final report and all proceedings pursuant thereto against the petitioner now pending as C.C.No.210 of 2015 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Ponnani are quashed.
