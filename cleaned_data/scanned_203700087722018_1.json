BY ADV. SRI.NIRMAL V NAIR SRI. T. R. RENJITH PP. THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 09.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: meg 2019/KER/1243 Cr1.MC.No. 8772 of 2018 2 ORDER This petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (the Code for brevity) with a prayer to quash the proceedings pending against the petitioner. 2. The petitioner herein is the accused in Crime No.759 of 2018 of the Kasaragod Police Station registered under Sections 452, 323, 324, 354, 427, 506(ii) r/w Section 34 of the IPC. 3. On 31.10.2018 at about 1.35 p.m., the petitioners herein in furtherance of their common intention, wrongfully restrained the respondents 2 and 3 and attacked them with weapons causing injuries. 4. I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners, the party respondents and the learned Public Prosecutor. It is submitted that the entire disputes between the parties have been amicably resolved. Reliance is placed on the affidavits filed by the 2\" and 3 respondents to buttress their submissions. It is urged that the dispute is purely personal in nature and would not affect public peace or tranquility. 2019/KER/1243 Cr1.MC.No. 8772 of 2018 3 5. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted that the statements of respondents 2 and 3 have been recorded and they stated in clear terms that they have no subsisting grievance. 6. I have considered the submissions advanced. 7. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303] and in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466], the Apex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. 8. The offence committed by the petitioners cannot be said to be grave and serious having ingredients of extreme mental depravity. It also does not appear that the offence in this case will have a serious impact on the society. It is felt that quashing of proceedings on account of compromise would bring about peace and secure the ends of justice. Even otherwise, persisting with the prosecution would be nothing, but a waste of time as the prospects of conviction is bleak. Having considered all the relevant 2019/KER/1243 Crl1.MC.No. 8772 of 2018 4 circumstances, I am of the considered view that this Court will be well justified in invoking its extraordinary powers under Section 482 of the Code to quash the proceedings. In the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-Ai FIR in Crime No. 759 of 2018 of the Kasaragod Police Station and all proceedings pursuant thereto against the petitioners are quashed. sD/- RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN V., JUDGE avs //TRUE COPY// P.A.
