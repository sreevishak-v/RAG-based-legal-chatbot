SRI .NIREESH MATHEW SRI .N.P.PRAJEESH RESPONDENT/S: STATE OF KERALA REPRESENTED BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR, HIGH COURT OF KERALA, ERNAKULAM, KOCHI 682 O31. OTHER PRESENT: SMT ..V.SREEJA, GP THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 04.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: ee a CB 2019/KER/365 Crl.MC.No. 8611 of 2018 -2- ORDER The petitioner is the accused in Crime C.R. No.15 of 2018 of Excise Enforcement and Anti Narcotic Special Squad, Palakkad registered for the offence under Section 20(b)(Gi)C of NDPS Act. The petitioner was granted bail by the court below as per Annexure A order. 2. The petitioner has filed this Crl.M.C. praying for setting aside or modifying condition Nos.1 to 3 in Annexure A order. 3. Heard. 4. Annexure A order contains four conditions, which are extracted hereunder:- 1. The petitioner shall be released on bail upon execution of bond for Rs.3,00,000/- ee 2019/KER/365 Crl.MC.No. 8611 of 2018 -3- (Rupees three lakhs only) with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of this court. The sureties shall produce solvency certificates for the said amount. One of the parents of the petitioner shall also appear before this court and execute bail bond. He shall also deposit a sum of Rs.75,000/- (Rupees seventy five thousand only) as cash security simultaneous to the execution of bail bond. 2. He shall appear before the Investigating Officer twice on every day at morning and evening until further orders immediately after his release from jail. 3. He shall surrender his passport if any before the court while executing bail bond or file affidavit m the event he does not hold passport along with a report of verification in ee a aes 2019/KER/365 Crl.MC.No. 8611 of 2018 -4- that regard by the S.I. of Police within whose territorial limits the petitioner resides. 4. He shall not get involved in any offence while on bail. 5. When this matter has been taken up for hearing, the learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the petitioner will be satisfied if condition No.1 is modified. The court below directed the petitioner to deposit Rs.75,000/-. The learned Public Prosecutor has no serious objection in reducing the amount to Rs.50,000/-. The other condition was that the surety should produce solvency certificate for the bond amount. Even though the bail was granted on 15.11.2018, the bail could not be executed as the sureties of the petitioner were not able to produce the solvency certificate, submitted by the learned counsel. In re CIP 2019/KER/365 Crl1.MC.No. 8611 of 2018 _5- view of the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner, it is directed that instead of producing the solvency certificate, sureties need to produce only the tax receipt of their properties. The petitioner shall also deposit an amount of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand only) before the court below, instead of Rs.75,000/- directed by the court below, simultaneously at the time of executing the bond. 6. The prosecution allegation is that the petitioner was found in possession of 36.526 Kgs. of Hashish oil in liquor form in an Alto Maruti Car on 19.3.2018 at about 11 a.m., in contravention of the provisions of the NDPS Act. Considering the nature and gravity of the allegations, I do not find any reason to interfere with condition Nos.2 to 4 in Annexure A order. eee a CIP 2019/KER/365 Cr1.MC.No. 8611 of 2018 -6- In the result, this Crl.M.C. stands disposed of as above. Dated this the 4\" day of January 2019. sd B.
