The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: Due to the animosity for the Informant having warned the Accused not to disturb his daughter, on 17.08.2011 at about 8. am, on the road side near Powdikonam Junction in Uliyazhathura Village, the Accused wrongfully restrained the Informant, showered obscene words on her, pressed on her cheek using his finger and caused hurt to her by slapping on her left cheek. The Accused also caught hold of her saree and pulled it, outraging her modesty causing mental agony to her and criminally intimidated her with threat of injury to her person, to that of her husband and to commit mischief by setting her house on fire. Thereby the Accused is alleged to have committed the above-mentioned offences. 3. The cognizance was taken on the basis of Final Report in respect of the offences under Sections 341, 294(b), 323, 354 and 506(i) of the Indian Penal Code,1860. On issuance of process, the Accused entered appearance. He was enlarged on bail. He was represented by a Counsel of his own choice. Copies of all relevant Prosecution records were furnished to him. After hearing both parties and on perusing relevant records, 3 Charge was framed for offences under Sections 341, 294(b), 323, 354 and 506(i) of the Indian Penal Code,1860. It was read over and explained to him, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. 4. From the side of Prosecution CW1 and CW4 were examined as PW1 and PW2 respectively and Exhibit P1 was marked. CW6 is no more and his death certificate was produced. The presence of CW2 could not be procured by the Prosecution, despite steps having been issued against him. The Learned Assistant Public Prosecutor gave up the remaining witnesses as the witnesses turned hostile to the Prosecution and Prosecution evidence was closed. Since no incriminating circumstances arose against the Accused from the deposition of the witnesses, his examination under Section 313 (1) (b) of the CrPC was dispensed with. No evidence was adduced from the side of the Defence. 5. Heard both sides and perused the documents. The following points arise for consideration. (a) Has the Accused wrongfully restrained PW1 and thereby committed offence punishable under Section 341 r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged? (b) Has the Accused uttered obscene words to PW1 and thereby committed offence punishable under Section 294(b) of the IPC as alleged? (c) Has the Accused on the same day, time and at the same place, voluntarily caused hurt to PW1 and thereby committed the offence punishable under section 323 of the IPC as alleged (d) Has the Accused used criminal force against PW1 intending to outrage her modesty and thereby committed the offence punishable under section 354 of the IPC as alleged? 4 (e) Has the Accused criminally intimidated PW1 with threat of injury to her person and thereby committed the offence punishable under section 506(i) of the IPC as alleged? (f) If so, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded? 6. Points (a) to (e): These points are considered together for the sake of brevity and for avoiding repetition. PW1 denied having statement to police to the effect that Accused assaulted her and uttered obscene words against PW1. She admitted her signature in Exhibit P1 statement. She deposed that the Accused is his neighbor and he has not assaulted her as alleged. She deposed that he does not intend to proceed with the case. PW2 deposed that she know both the Accused as well as PW1, but denied having witnessed the incident and to have given statement to the police to that effect. effect that he had witnessed the alleged incident. I have carefully considered the evidence adduced by the Prosecution and the materials on record. It is pertinent to note that PW1, the injured herself is having no complaint or allegations that the Accused have assaulted him. He deposed that he has no such complaints against the Accused. The remaining witnesses were given up by the Prosecution as no purpose would be served in examining the remaining witness, when the Injured herself has no case supporting the Prosecution. On perusal of the evidence led by the Prosecution and the materials on record, it is clear from the testimony of PWs1 and 2 that there is no evidence to support the Prosecution case. None of the ingredients of the alleged offences are made out from the evidence adduced. There is nothing available on record to implicate the Accused to the above incident. Hence, on a total consideration of facts and circumstances of the above 5 case and on appreciation of the evidence adduced, this Court finds that the Prosecution has failed to prove the case against the Accused persons and therefore, Points (a) to (e) are found in favour of the Accused persons. 8. Point No.(f): In wake of analysis and finding on the forgoing points, this point does not arise for consideration. In the result, Accused is found not guilty of having committed the offences punishable under Sections 341, 294(b), 323, 354 and 506(i) of the Indian Penal Code,1860. He is acquitted of the aforesaid offences under Section 248(1) of the CrPC. His bail bond stands cancelled and he is set at liberty.
