ANNEXURE A2 TRUE CERTIFIED COPY THE CHARGE SHEET IN C.C. NO. 1523/2015 ON THE FILED OF J.F.C.M. COURT, TALIPARAMBA. RESPONDENT (S)' ANNEXURE: NIL //TRUE COPY// P.S.TO JUDGE Msv/ BREE 2016/KER/34121 RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.Y, J Dated this the 4\" day of August, 2016 ORDER 1.The petitioners are the accused Nos.1 to 5 in C.C.No.1523 of 2015 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class Court, Taliparamba. They are prosecuted for having committed offence punishable under Ss. 143, 147, 341, 323 read with 149 of the IPC. The 2 respondent is the de facto complainant. 2.The instant petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure banking on the ratio of the Judgment rendered by the Apex Court in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab ( 2012 (4) KLT 108) and a series of other cases which include Narinder Singh and others v. State of Punjab and anr. (2014) 6 SCC 466) and Yogendra Yadav and others V State of Jharkhand (2014 (9) SCC 653 ) with a prayer to quash the above BARE 2016/KER/34121 Crl.M.C.4382/2016 2 proceeding. 3.The sole ground is that the Apex Court in the above judgments have delineated the circumstances and the cases in which inherent powers under Section 482 can be invoked de hors section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for recognizing out of court settlement for the purpose of quashing criminal proceedings. It is prayed that powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure be invoked to quash the criminal proceedings. 4.It is submitted that the parties have reached an out of court settlement and there is no acrimony between them at present. All the disputes have been amicably resolved and they desire to live in peace and harmony. The respondent No.2 has filed an affidavit wherein he assert that he has no objection in terminating the proceedings. 5.The gist of the allegation is that on 6.10.2015 at 1 p.m., the petitioners formed themselves into an_ unlawful assembly and are alleged to have assaulted him causing Bsieetahl 2016/KER/34121 Crl.M.C.4382/2016 3 injuries. 6.The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submits that no other cases of heinous nature are reported against the petitioners. 7.I have given my anxious consideration to the submissions made across the bar and I have also gone through the materials on record. 8.The victim has sworn to an affidavit in which he asserts that he has no objection in allowing the petition and in quashing the proceedings as all the disputes between the parties have been resolved and the parties are living in peace and harmony . 9.It appears to me that the offence is entirely personal in nature and do not affect public peace or tranquility. It is also felt that quashing of proceedings on account of compromise would bring about peace. In a case such as the instant one, even if the prosecution is allowed to continue, it would not serve any purpose as the possibility BARE 2016/KER/34121 Crl.M.C.4382/2016 4 of conviction is remote and bleak. It can only result in putting the de facto complainant and the accused to unwanted oppression and prejudice. Settlement will augur well for the interest of the community and will enable the parties to live in peace and harmony. 10.1 am of the view that this Court is well justified in quashing the impugned proceedings as the instant case falls within the matrix of guidelines issued by the Apex Court in Gian Singh ( Supra ) and the other cases referred to above. In the result, this petition is allowed. All further proceedings against the petitioners, who are accused Nos.1 to 5 in C.C.No.1523 of 2015 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class Court, Taliparamba, shall stand quashed.
