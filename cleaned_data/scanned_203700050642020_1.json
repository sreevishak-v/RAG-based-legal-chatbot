OTHER PRESENT: PP T.R.RENJITH THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 08.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: BLE Oa Crl.MC.No.5064 OF 2020(C) ide. 202 UKER/TS312 ORDER Dated this the 8th day of January 2021 Petitioners are the accused in Crime No.2026/2020 registered at the Mangalapuram Police Station for offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 294(b), 324, 326 and 427 r/w 149 of IPC. The de facto complainant and the other persons injured are arrayed as respondents 2 and 3. Annexures-A2 and A3 affidavits have been filed by the said respondents stating that the dispute, which was the reason for the incident and registration of the crime, has been resolved amicably and they have no subsisting grievance against the petitioners. 2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also, who, on instructions, submits that the petitioners have no criminal antecedents. 3. Having considered the gravity of the offences alleged, nature of the injury caused and having BLE Oa Crl.MC.No.5064 OF 2020(C) Be. 202 UKER/TS312 perused the affidavits filed by respondents 2 and 3, the contents of which are submitted to be true and voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled and no public interest is involved in this matter. Even though there is allegation of the petitioners having committed offence under Section 326 and the records show that the de facto complainant had sustained grievous injuries, considering the fact that an amicable settlement has been arrived at between the parties, based on which, the de facto complainant, who is arrayed the accused in Crime No.2055/2020 of the Mangalapuram Police Station for the offences punishable under Sections 447, 341, 294(b), 323, 324 and 354 r/w 34 of IPC, had approached this Court by filing Criminal M.C.No.5058/2020, which was allowed by order dated 27.11.2020, I am inclined to grant the relief sought. Moreover, in view of the settlement, possibility of the criminal proceedings ending in Beet Crl.MC.No.5064 OF 2020(C) An. 202 UKER/TS312 conviction is remote. As such, continuance of the proceedings will amount to an abuse of process of court and hence, in view of the legal position set out by the Honourable Supreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is no impediment in granting the relief sought. In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. Annexure- Al FIR and the proceedings in Crime No.2026/2020 registered at the Mangalapuram Police Station, as against the petitioners, is quashed.
