RESPONDENT (S)' EXHIBITS : NIL. //TRUE COPY// P.A.TO JUDGE bp ae 2016/KER/33881 RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN, V., J. Dated this the 3\" day of August, 2016 ORDER 1.The petitioners herein are the accused Nos. 1 to 4 in C.C.No.360 of 2016 of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class-II, Aluva. They are charged for having committed offence punishable under Sections 448 and 323 read with 34 of the IPC. The 2\" respondent is the victim. 2.The instant petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure banking on the ratio of the Judgment rendered by the Apex Court in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab ( 2012 (4) KLT 108) and a series of other cases which include Narinder Singh and others v. State of Punjab and anr. [2014) 6 SCC 466] and Yogendra Yadav and others V State of Jharkhand ae CrI.M.C. No.4378 of 2016 -2- NLS [2014 (9) SCC 653] with a prayer to quash the above proceeding. 3.The sole ground is that the Apex Court in the above judgments have delineated the circumstances and the cases in which inherent powers under Section 482 can be invoked de hors section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for recognizing out of court settlement for the purpose of quashing criminal proceedings. It is prayed that powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure be invoked to quash the criminal proceedings . 4.It is submitted that the parties have reached an out of court settlement and there is no acrimony between them at present. All the disputes have been amicably resolved and they desire to live in peace and harmony. The 2\" respondent has sworn to an affidavit wherein he asserts that he has no objection in terminating the proceedings. 5.The gist of the prosecution allegation is that on 17.4.2016, the petitioners had assaulted the 2\"? respondent and 2016/KER/33881 Cri.M.C. No.4378 of 2016 ~3- caused injuries. 6.The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submits that no other cases of heinous nature are reported against the petitioners. 7.I have given my anxious consideration to the submissions made across the bar and I have also gone through the materials on record. 8.The victim has sworn to an affidavit wherein it is asserted that he has no objection in allowing the petition and in quashing the proceedings as all the disputes between the parties have been resolved and the parties are living in peace and harmony . 9.It appears to me that the offence is entirely personal in nature and do not affect public peace or tranquility. It is also felt that quashing of proceedings on account of compromise would bring about peace. In a case such as the instant one, even if the prosecution is allowed to continue, it would not serve any purpose as the possibility a ap 2016/KER/33881 CrI.M.C. No.4378 of 2016 ~4- of conviction is remote and bleak. It can only result in putting the de facto complainant and the accused to unwanted oppression and prejudice. Settlement will augur well for the interest of the community and will enable the parties to live in peace and harmony. 10.1 am of the view that this Court is well justified in quashing the impugned proceedings as the instant case falls within the matrix of guidelines issued by the Apex Court in Gian Singh (Supra) and the other cases referred to above. In the result, this petition is allowed. All further proceedings against the petitioners, who are the accused Nos. 1 to 4 in C.C.No.360 of 2016 of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class-II, Aluva are quashed. Sd/- RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN, V. JUDGE Ps/5/8/16"
