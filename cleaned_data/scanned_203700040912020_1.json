CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 06.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: | Oa Crl.MC.No.4091 OF 2020 (B) Be. 202 1IKERITS4 ORDER Dated this the 6th day of January 2021 Petitioners are the accused in Crime No.574- 2008 registered at the Edachery Police Station for offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 323, 324 and 308 r/w 149 of IPC, now pending as S.C.No0.842/2018 on the files of the Assistant Sessions Court, Vadakara. As per Annexure-2 judgment, all accused except the petitioners were acquitted. The case against the petitioners was split up and refiled as S.C.No.842/2018. The de facto complainant, at whose instance the crime was registered, is arrayed as the 2 respondent. Annexure-3 affidavit has been filed by 2\"? respondent stating that the reason for the incident, which led to registration of the crime, has been resolved amicably, in view of the settlement and | Bee Crl1.MC.No.4091 OF 2020(B) AL, 202UKERI7S4 he has no subsisting grievance against the petitioner. 2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also, who, on instructions, submits that the petitioner has no criminal antecedents. 3. Having considered the gravity of the offences alleged, nature of the injury caused and having perused the affidavit filed by the 2\" respondent, the contents of which are submitted to be true and voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled and no public interest is involved in this matter. The fact that the accused Nos. 2 to 6 were acquitted after trial as evident by Annexure-2 judgment and the further fact that the dispute has been dissolved between the parties is also taken into consideration. Moreover, in view of the settlement, possibility of the criminal proceedings ending in conviction is remote. As such, continuance of the proceedings will amount to an i cone Oa Crl1.MC.No.4091 OF 2020(B) Be. 202UKERI7S4 abuse of process of court and hence, in view of the legal position set out by the Honourable Supreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is no impediment in granting the relief sought. In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. The proceedings in S.C.No.842/2018 on the files of the Assistant Sessions Court, Vadakara is quashed.
