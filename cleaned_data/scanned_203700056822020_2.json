R3-8 BY ADV. SHAHID AZEEZ PP T.R.RENJITH THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 07.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Crme 5682/2020 A 2021/KER/1123 V.G.ARUN, J. ~~ GrLM.C.No.5682 of 2020. Dated this the 7 day of January, 2021 ORDER Petitioners are the accused in Crime No.394 of 2011 registered at the Chittarikkal Police Station for the offence punishable under Sections 420 and 120B r/w 34 of IPC and Sections 3, 4 5 and 6 of the Prize Chits and Money Circulation Schemes (Banning) Act 1978, now pending as C.C.No.450 of 2018 of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kasargod. The de facto complainant and the witnesses at whose instance the crime was registered are respondents 3 to 8. Annexures A3, A4, A5, A6, A7 and A& affidavits have been filed by respondents 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 respectively stating that the dispute has been settled and that they have no subsisting grievance against the petitioners. 2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also, who, on instructions, submits that the petitioners have no_ criminal antecedents. 3. Having considered the gravity of the offences alleged, nature of the injury caused and having perused the affidavit filed by the respondents 3 to 8, the contents of which are submitted Crme 5682/2020 5 2021/KER/1123 to be true and voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled and that no public interest is involved in this matter. Moreover, in view of the settlement, possibility of the criminal proceedings ending in conviction is remote. As_ such, continuance of the proceedings will amount to an abuse of process of court and hence, in view of the legal position set out by the Honourable Supreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is no impediment in granting the relief sought. 4. In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. The proceedings in C.C.No.450 of 2018 of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kasargod, as far as petitioners are concerned, is quashed.
