Referring to Annexure-2, it is submitted that the 3% respondent is the officer authorised to make a complaint to the Court or to compound the offence. 3.The grievance of the petitioners is that the vehicle has not been produced before the 3 respondent till date. The prayer in this petition is to issue direction to the 2\" respondent to act in terms of the Transportation Rules, 2015 and to produce the vehicle seized before the 3 respondent. It is further prayed that directions be issued to the 3 respondent to provide an opportunity to the petitioners to compound the offence under Rule 32 of the Transportation Rules, 2015. 4.I have heard the learned Public Prosecutor as well. pene ner A Eee peer Fa 2016/KER/33888 CrI.M.C. No. 4897 of 2016 =-3- 5.I find considerable merit in the submission of the learned counsel. It is evident on a reading of Rule 32 of the Transportation Rules, 2015 and also S.R.O No. 375 of 2015 produced by the petitioners that the 3% respondent is the competent authority to prefer complaint before the learned Magistrate and also to allow the compounding of the offence. Hence, the following directions are issued, to secure the ends of justice :- i. The 2? respondent is directed to produce the aforesaid vehicle involved in the offence before the 3% respondent within a period of two days from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. ii. The 3 respondent shall permit the petitioners to compound the offence under Rule 32 of the Rules, if the same is permissible under law. ii. The above endeavour shall be completed within a period of 5 days from the date of receipt of this order. Bae ner A Eee peer Fa 2016/KER/33888 CrI.M.C. No. 4897 of 2016 -4- If the offence is compounded in terms of Rule 32 of the Transportation Rules, 2015, necessarily the vehicle shall be released forthwith.
