AMJAD ALI THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 07.01.2020, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: a 2020/KER/499 Crl.M.C. No. 8275 of 2019 Cri.M.C. No.8275 of 2019 ORDER This is a petition filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for quashing the proceedings pending against the petitioner in S.C. No. 177 of 2018 on the files of the Assistant Sessions Court, Karunagappally. 2. The petitioner is the third accused in Crime No. 67 of 2012 of Sasthamcotta Police Station registered under Sections 452 and 511 of 376 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. There were altogether four accused in the said case. The petitioner was not available at the time of the committal proceedings. Consequently, the case was committed for trial as against accused Nos.1, 2 and 4. During the pendency of the proceedings before the trial court, the first accused committed suicide. Proceedings in the circumstances, was continued against accused Nos.2 and 4. The trial court found the accused guilty of offences punishable under Sections 452 and 354 read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code and convicted them. Accused Nos. 2 and 4 challenged the decision of the trial court in Crl.A. No. 20 of 2018. ante 2020/KER/499 Crl.M.C. No. 8275 of 2019 Annexure 4 is the judgment in the said case. In terms of the said judgment, the appellate court found that the evidence of the prosecutrix who was examined as PW1 was not reliable and that therefore, there cannot be any conviction based on the said evidence. Consequently, accused Nos. 2 and 4 were acquitted. In the meanwhile, the petitioner appeared before the committal court and consequently the case against him was also committed for trial as S.C. No. 177 of 2018. The petitioner seeks orders to quash the said proceedings on the ground that in the light of the decision in Crl.A. No.20 of 2018, the proceedings now pending against him is an abuse of the process of the Court as no purpose whatsoever would be served by the said proceedings. 3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as also the learned Public Prosecutor. 4. The essence of the finding, on the basis of which accused Nos.2 and 4 were acquitted by the appellate court, contained in paragraph 16 of the judgment reads thus: 16. On analysing the evidence of PW1, the prosecutrix, it is found that her testimony is inconsistent with her earlier version in Ext.P1 on material aspects. The fact that PW1 had not suffered any bodily injury ante 2020/KER/499 Crl.M.C. No. 8275 of 2019 though she allegedly resisted violent rape attempt by four adult persons is a suspicious circumstance. There are material discrepancies and contradictions in the testimony of PW1. Infirmities of this nature would not have occurred in the testimony of PW1 if she was speaking true facts. There is no ring of the truth in the testimony of PW1. The delay of six days is not properly explained. In view of the infirm nature of the evidence of PW1, this Court is view that it is not safe to rely on her testimony. In the said circumstances it is held that the prosecution has failed to prove that the accused have committed the offences alleged against them. Point is thus held against the prosecution and it is held that the conviction and sentence of the court below is not legally sustainable. It is seen that the case against the accused in both cases is built on the statement of PW1. Insofar as it is found that the said statement is not reliable and that there cannot be any conviction based on the same, according to me, the substratum of the case is lost. 5. If that be so, in the light of the decision of this Court in Moosa v. Sub Inspector of Police (2006 (1) KLT 552), no purpose whatsoever would be served by directing the petitioner to face the trial, and the trial against the petitioner would only be a futile exercise, resulting in wastage of precious eee ean Ee a 2020/KER/499 Crl.M.C. No. 8275 of 2019 judicial time intended for productive works. The proceedings against the petitioner, in the circumstances, is liable to be quashed. In the result, the Crl.M.C. is allowed and all further proceedings in S.C. No.177 of 2018 on the files of the Assistant Sessions Court, Karunagappally is quashed.
