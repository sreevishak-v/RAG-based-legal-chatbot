Bese tal OR ore Cr1.MC.5465/2020 2 2021/KER/813 V.G.ARUN, J. Dated this the 6\" day of January, 2021 ORDER Petitioner is the sole accused in Crime No.315 of 2018 of Kilikolloor Police Station, registered for the offence punishable under Section 118(a) of the Kerala Police Act, 2011, now pending as C.C.No.766 of 2018 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-l, Kollam. The prosecution allegation is that by about 2 p.m on 8.5.2018, the petitioner was found in front of Kilikolloor Police Station, in an inebriated and quarrelsome condition, which was likely to cause breach of peace. The petitioner seeks to get the further proceedings in the case against him quashed primarily on the ground that even if the allegations are accepted in their entirety, the alleged offence was not made out. 2. Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that in order to attract the offence under Section 118(a) of the Kerala Police Act, the accused should have been in a public place and in an intoxicated manner or rioting condition or incapable of looking after himself. Referring to Annexure II final report, it is contended that the allegation is only of petitioner being found in a quarrelsome condition, unable to Bese tal OR ore Cr1.MC.5465/2020 3 202 U/KER/813 stand on his own and using abusive language. It is submitted that the definition of the term 'rioting' not being available under the Kerala Police Act, the definition provided under Section 146 of IPC ought to be adopted. It is further contended that, unless blood test is conducted and the alcohol content in the blood found to be in excess of the permitted level, a person cannot be held to be in an intoxicated condition. It is pointed out that even going by the prosecution case, only breath analyzer test was conducted, for which also there is no documentary evidence. The learned counsel submitted that the petitioner has been advised for appointment as Police Constable and was not sent for training on account of his implication in the criminal case. 3. | find substantial force in the contentions urged by the learned counsel. A vague allegation of the petitioner being found in a quarrelsome condition will not attract the offence under Section 118(a). There is essential difference between quarrelsome and rioting conditions. Further, there is no evidence to prove that the petitioner was in an intoxicated condition, except the statement that he was unable to stand on his own. Hence, further proceedings in the case based on such unsubstantiated and vague allegations amount to an abuse of process of court. steel Dene! Cr1.MC.5465/2020 4 2021/KER/813 In the result, the Crl.M.C is allowed. Further proceedings in C.C.No.766 of 2018 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-l, Kollam is quashed.
