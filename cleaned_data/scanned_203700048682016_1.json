RESPONDENT (S)' ANNEXURES: NIL //TRUE COPY// P.S. TO JUDGE mbr/ nee 2016/KER/33671 RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN, V., J. Dated this the 1 day of August, 2016 ORDER 1.A lorry bearing registration No. KL-07-BD-8169 owned by the 1* petitioner and another lorry bearing Reg.No.KL-36- 8449 belonging to the 3 petitioner was seized by the 2\" respondent on 27.7.2016, alleging commission of offence under the Kerala Minerals (Prevention of illegal Mining, Storage and Transportation) Rules, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as the Transportation Rules, 2015). 2.As per Rule 32 of the Transportation Rules, 2015, any offence punishable under the said rules can be compounded, either before or after the institution of the prosecution, by the person authorized under Section 22 of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, nee 2016/KER/33671 CriI.M.C. No.4868 of 2016 -2- 1957 or clause (ii) of Rule 2 of the Transportation Rules, 2015, to make a complaint to the Court with respect to that offence, on payment to that person, for credit to the Government, of such sum as that person may specify. Referring to Annexure-A3, it is submitted that the 3 respondent is the officer authorised to make a complaint to the Court or to compound the offence. 3.The grievance of the petitioners is that the vehicles have not been produced before the 3 respondent till date. The prayer in this petition is to issue direction to the 2\" respondent to act in terms of the Transportation Rules, 2105 and to produce the vehicles seized before the 3 respondent. It is further prayed that directions be issued to the 3% respondent to provide an opportunity to the petitioners to compound the offence under Rule 32 of the Transportation Rules, 2015. 4.I have heard the learned Public Prosecutor as well. Bae ape 2016/KER/33671 Cri.M.C. No.4868 of 2016 -3- 5.I find considerable merit in the submission of the learned counsel. It is evident on a reading of Rule 32 of the Transportation Rules, 2015 and also S.R.O No. 375 of 2015 produced by the petitioners that the 3% respondent is the competent authority to prefer complaint before the learned Magistrate and also to allow the compounding of the offence. Hence, the following directions are issued, to secure the ends of justice :- i. The 2 respondent is directed to produce the aforesaid vehicles involved in the offence before the 3% respondent within a period of two days from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. ii. The 3% respondent shall permit the petitioners to compound the offence under Rule 32 of the Rules, if the same is permissible under law. ii. The above endeavour shall be completed within a period of 5 days from the date of receipt of this order. Bae ape 2016/KER/33671 Cri.M.C. No.4868 of 2016 -4- If the offence is compounded in terms of Rule 32 of the Transportation Rules, 2015, necessarily the vehicles shall be released forthwith. This petition is disposed off.
