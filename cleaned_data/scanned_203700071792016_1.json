Crl.M.C.No. 7179 of 2016 Dated this the 11% day of January, 2017 ORDER The petitioner herein is the sole accused in CC No.806/2016 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-1, Nedumangad for offences punishable under Sections 451 & 294(b) of IPC and Section 118(a) of KP Act. 2. The allegation of the prosecution is that, on 4/4/2016 at 11 15PM, the accused, after consuming alcohol, trespassed into Valiyamala police station and uttered obscene words. He refused to comply with the lawful directions given by the woman police constable. Crime was registered and after investigation final report was laid. 3. Contenting that he is a highly religious person, that he was falsely implicated due to reasons best known to him and that the police have made every attempt to procure certificate to make it appear that the petitioner was drunk at the time of the incident, the petitioner has approached this Court seeking reliefs. It was contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner, relying on Annexure AIII certificate, that the petitioner herein was certified to be not drunk by the duty doctor attached to the Nedumangad District Hospital . It was further contended that pressure was al 2017/KER/1514 Crl.M.C.NO.7179/2016 2 exerted on the doctor to give the certificate otherwise. 4. Learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted that the petitioner herein is involved in other cases and that alcometer test conducted on the relevant day established that he was drunk at the relevant time. But, the doctor gave a certificate to the contrary. It was submitted that hence a complaint was submitted to the Director of Health Services. 5. I do not propose to go into the merits of the relevant contentions except to hold that essentially it is a matter to be established by the prosecution on the basis of the evidence let in by it at the time of trial. Hence, the question now cannot be answered in the light of the materials available to held that no material is placed before the court below to prove the allegations. In the light of the above, I am not inclined to invoke the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. However, the petitioner herein will be free to raise all his objections before the trial court even at the appropriate stage.
