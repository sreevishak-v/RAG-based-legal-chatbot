The aforesaid case has arisen from Crime No.297 of 2010 of Kuttiadi Police Station registered for the offences punishable under Section 143, 147, 148, 160, 435, 427 read with Section 149 of the IPC and under section 3(2)(e) of the PDPP Act. 2.After investigation, final report was laid before the jurisdictional Court arraying 30 persons as the accused. The petitioners were arrayed as 14, 22, 24, 26 and 30 in the final report. The petitioners did not appear before the court below and face the trial. The case was proceeded against accused Nos.1 to 13, 15 to 21, 23, 25 and 27 to 29. They were found not guilty by the learned Magistrate BREE soakensants Crl.M.C.4162/2016 2 and were acquitted under section 248(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. (hereinafter referred to as the Code). 3.The petitioners have preferred this petition under Section 482 of the Code seeking to quash the above proceedings on the ground that the substratum of the case has been shattered in view of the acquittal of the co-accused. 4.1 have heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as well as the learned Public Prosecutor. 5.1 have given my _ anxious considerations to the submissions made across the bar and I have also gone through the materials on record. It is evident from Annexure-II judgment of the court below that none of the witnesses had supported the case of the prosecution. The learned Additional Sessions Judge after evaluating the prosecution evidence in a meticulous manner concluded that there is no evidence to connect the accused with the crime. The prosecution witnesses had gone to the extent BREE soakensants Crl.M.C.4162/2016 3 of testifying that they were unaware as to the identity of the persons who attacked them. These observations, would definitely affect the very substratum of the prosecution case. As held by this Court in Moosa v. Sub Inspector of Police (2006 (1) KLT 552), though the reasoning of the judgment contained or appreciation of evidence in the case of a co-accused therein are not grounds to attract any relief under Section 482 of the Code, a case where the substratum of the case is lost is an exception to the above rule. 6.1 am of the firm view that no purpose is going to be served by directing the petitioners to face the trial at this stage. It can only be a futile exercise and the only purpose that will be served is to gnaw into precious time during which more productive work can be done by the court below. The prospects of conviction is extremely remote owing to the acquittal of the co accused. In the result, this petition is allowed. The proceedings RERAaE bishan 2016/KER/34118 Crl.M.C.4162/2016 4 as against the petitioners in C.C.No.261 of 2014 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class Court, Payyoli are quashed.
