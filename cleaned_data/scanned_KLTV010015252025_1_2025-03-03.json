Criminal M.C.No. 648/2025 Crime No 238/2025 of Kattakada Police Station Petitioner/Accused No. 1 :- Rojin John J aged 29 years S/o. John C residing at Rojin Bhavan, Kazhachikkadu Chandramangalam, Thiruvananthapuram By Advocate:- Ananda Subramaniam Counter Petitioners :- 1. State of Kerala 2. The Station House Officer Kattakada Police Station Thiruvananthapuram By Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumari This Criminal M.C. is coming on for hearing on 01.03.2025 and the court on 03.03.2025 passed the following ORDER This is the 2\" application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail. 2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable under Sections 126(2), 296(b), 115(2), 118(1), 110, 351(3) and 324(4) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, and Crime No. 238/2025 of Kattakada Police Station is registered against the petitioner arraying him as the 1* accused. 3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- Due to enmity towards the defacto complainant, on 08.02.2025 at about 7 p.m., while the 2 defacto complainant was going home along with his wife and his two children, in a scooter, and when they reached in the road in front of the house of the accused situated at Kazhinjikkadu, the 1* accused wrongfully restrained the defacto complainant, abused him and slapped him on his left cheek, and when the defacto complainant questioned the said acts, the 1* accused, by using a reaper, beat on his back, and when the wife of the defacto complainant intervened, the 1* accused beat her on her back with his right hand. Then, the 24 accused, who reached there at that time, using a reaper, beat on the head of the defacto complainant, and when prevented, it hit on his head and right hand, causing injuries. When the defacto complainant fell down, the 2 accused threatened him, abused him and kicked him on his chest, and the 1* accused, by using the reaper, damaged the bike, causing a total loss to the tune of Rs.15,000/- to the defacto complainant. 4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The Investigating Officer filed report opposing the anticipatory bail application. 5. The earlier pre-arrest bail application filed by the petitioner was dismissed by this Court as per Order dated 19.02.2025 in Criminal M.C.No. 482/2025. 6. Heard. Perused the records. 7. The only point to be considered is, whether an order of anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioner/ 1* accused. 3 8. The Point:- The petitioner/ 1 accused along with the 2 accused is alleged to have restrained the defacto complainant and his family, while they were going to their house in a scooter, abused the defacto complainant, and by using reapers, attacked him and damaged his scooter. The petitioner/1* accused assaulted the wife of the defacto complainant also. The motive as alleged is the misunderstanding of the accused persons that the defacto complainant informed the police that they assaulted the grandmother of the petitioner/1* accused. 9. According to the petitioner, he and his father are absolutely innocent of the allegations levelled against them and they have not committed any offences as alleged. It is submitted that, on the alleged date of incident, at about 6 p.m., the defacto complainant trespassed into the house of the petitioner, uttered abusive words, and attacked him, and thereafter, the defacto complainant preferred a false complaint against the petitioner. The petitioner submits that, there is delay in lodging the First Information Report. 10. There is serious allegation as against the petitioner. Allegedly, the petitioner/ 1 accused along with the 2 accused had abused and attacked the defacto complainant, using reapers, and assaulted his wife. In the body note with the First Information Statement, it is noted that, a healed wound is seen on the head of the defacto complainant and abrasion is on the right side of his chest. So, the prosecution has made out a prima facie case against the petitioner/ 1 accused and regarding the involvement of the petitioner in the 4 alleged offence. It is stated in the report that the seat cover and cushion cover of the motorcycle, and a reaper used for the commission of the offence, were recovered and the wound certificate is obtained. It is seen from the report that the loss sustained due to damaging of the motorcycle is primarily assessed as Rs.15,000/-. The investigation is progressing. It is reported that the 1* petitioner is involved in one another crime. Considering the facts stated in the report to the effect that the petitioner is involved in the offence, it appears that exceptional jurisdiction to grant a pre-arrest bail cannot be exercised in this case. 11. In Jai Prakash Singh v. State of Bihar and Another (2012 (4) SCC 379), the Honble Apex court has held that, an order of pre-arrest bail being an extra ordinary privilege, should be granted only in exceptional cases. It is settled in law that arrest should be the last option and it should be restricted to cases where arrest is imperative in the facts and circumstances of a case and consistent view is that the grant of anticipatory bail shall be restricted to exceptional circumstances. So it is clear that the power to grant anticipatory bail under section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita. is an exceptional power and should be exercised only in exceptional cases and not as a matter of course. Its object is to ensure that a person should not be harassed or humiliated in order to satisfy the grudge or personal vendetta of the complainant. [Reliance placed on the decision rendered by the Honble Apex Court in HDFC Bank Limited v. J.J. Mannan and Another (2010 (1) SCC 679); Srikant Upadhyay 5 v. State of Bihar (2024 KHC Online 6137)]. In the case at hand, I find no exceptional circumstance to exercise the exceptional power of granting anticipatory bail. 12. Considering the serious allegation against the petitioner and gravity of the offence, it appears that granting the petitioner with an order of anticipatory bail will adversely affect the investigation. If an order of anticipatory bail is granted he is likely to influence the witnesses and tamper with the evidence. Further, no change in circumstances is brought out after the dismissal of the earlier bail application. Considering all these aspects, this court is not inclined to grant an order of pre-arrest bail to the petitioner. In the result, this petition is dismissed.
