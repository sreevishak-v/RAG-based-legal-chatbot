CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 04.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: CRL.M.C.NO.5586 OF 2020 ; 2021/KER/107 ORDER Dated this the 4th day of January 2021 Petitioners are accused Nos.1, 2 and 3 in Crime No.550/2016 registered at the Varappuzha Police Station, Ernakulam for offences punishable under Sections 323, 294(b), 448, 506 (1) read with Section 34 of IPC, now pending as C.C.No.510/2016 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-III, North Paravur. The de facto complainant, at whose instance the crime was registered, is arrayed as the 3 respondent. Annexure-A3 affidavit has been filed by 3% respondent stating that the dispute, which was the reason for the incident and registration of the crime, has been resolved amicably and he has no subsisting grievance against the petitioners. CRL.M.C.NO.5586 OF 2020 ; 2021/KER/107 2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also, who, on instructions, submits that the petitioners have no criminal antecedents. 3. Having considered the gravity of the offences alleged, nature of the injury caused and having perused the affidavit filed by the 3** respondent, the contents of which are submitted to be true and voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled and no public interest is involved in this matter. Moreover, in view of the settlement, possibility of the criminal proceedings ending in conviction is remote. As such, continuance of the proceedings will amount to an abuse of process of court and hence, in view of the legal position set out by the Honourable Supreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another [(2012) 10 Bere sha] Le pa : eo ope CRL.M.C.NO.5586 OF 2020 2021/KER/107 4 SCC 303], there is no impediment in granting the relief sought. In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. The proceedings in C.C.No.510/2016 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-III, North Paravur is quashed.
