RESPONDENTS' EXHIBITS: NIL //TRUE COPY// vgd PA TO JUDGE 2018/KER/254 SUNIL THOMAS, J. Dated this the 4\" day of January, 2018 ORDER The petitioners are arrayed as the accused in S.C. No.896/2012 of Additional Sessions Court 1, Alappuzha arising from Crime No.274/2011 of Pattanakkadu Police Station for offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 149, 452, 323, 324, 354 & 427 of IPC and Sections 3(1)(v)(xi) of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. It was alleged by the prosecution that due to previous enmity, on 11.06.2011, the petitioners trespassed into the house of the de facto complainant and attacked the de facto complainant and others. Petitioners abused the de facto complainant by calling caste name. Respondents 2 to 9 are the de facto complainant and the injured persons. Accordingly, crime was registered. After investigation final report was laid as Annexure Al. 2. Itis stated that the parties have resolved their disputes among themselves amicably. Accordingly, Crl.M.C. is filed on a premise that the respondents do not have any objection in quashing the criminal proceedings. To substantiate it, the mo) 2018/KER/254 Cri. M. C. No. 8251 of 2017 2 petitioners have produced Annexures A2 to AQ affidavits affirmed by the injured persons and the de facto complainant. 3. The learned Public Prosecutor on_ instructions submitted that the parties have resolved their disputes. The statement of the victims have been recorded. It is seen that though 7 persons sustained injury, no dangerous weapon is seen used. They are neighbours also. It is seen that the petitioners are not involved in any other crime. 4. Having considered these facts, | feel that no purpose will be served by prosecuting the petitioners and the dispute is essentially in the nature of a private dispute between the parties. Hence, | am inclined to invoke the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to give a quietus to the entire disputes. Hence, Cri.M.C. is allowed. All further proceedings in S.C. No.896/2012 of Additional Sessions Court 1, Alappuzha stand quashed. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE. Pn 2018/KER/254 Cri. M. C. No. 8251 of 2017 3 Additional Sessions Court-1, Alappuzha occurring in the 2\" line of paragraph 1 at page 1 and in the operative portion of the final order dated 04/01/2018 in Crl.M.C.
