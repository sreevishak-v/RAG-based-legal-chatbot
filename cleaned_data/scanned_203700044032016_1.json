Cri.M.C.No. 4403 of 2016 Dated this the 01* day of August, 2016 ORDER xxx 1.The petitioner herein is the 1 accused in C.C No. 283 of 2015 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Malappuram. The aforesaid case has arisen from Crime No.391 of 2010 of the Malappuram Police Station registered for offence punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 447, 341, 323, 324, 427 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. 2.After investigation, final report was laid before the jurisdictional Magistrate and the case was initially taken for cognizance as C.C. No. 1440 of 2011. The petitioner is arrayed as the 2 accused in the aforesaid charge. The case was proceeded with and as per Annexure B judgment dated 21.02.2015, the accused Nos. 1 and 3 to 7 were found not guilty of the offence and they have nee 2016/KER/33664 Crl.M.C.No. 4403 of 2016 ; acquitted under Section 248(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 3.The case against the petitioner herein was split up and refilled as C.C No. 283 of 2015. After the acquittal of the other accused, the matter was amicably resolved between the parties and Annexure-C is the affidavit sworn to by the 2 respondent/de facto complainant before this Court wherein, he asserts that the matter has been settled and that he has no objection in terminating the criminal proceedings. 4.1 have given my anxious considerations to the submissions made across the bar and I have also gone through the materials on record. Annexure B judgment, which records the acquittal of the co accused, reveals that the de facto complainant had deposed before the court that the matter had been settled. PWs 2 and 3 are the eye witnesses to the occurrence and they did not support the prosecution case. Learned Magistrate came to the conclusion that the evidence let in did not connect the accused with the crime. These findings nee 2016/KER/33664 Crl.M.C.No. 4403 of 2016 ; entered into by the learned Magistrate would definitely affect the very substratum of the prosecution case. As held by a three Judge Bench of this Court in Moosa V Sub Inspector of Police (2006 (1) KLT 552), though the reasoning of the judgment contained or appreciation of evidence in the case of a co-accused therein are not grounds to attract any relief under Section 482 of the Code, a case where the substratum of the case is lost is an exception to the above rule. 5.I am of the firm view that no purpose is going to be served by directing the petitioner to face the trial at this stage. It can only be a futile exercise and the only purpose that will be served is to gnaw into precious time during which more productive work can be done by the court below. The prospects of conviction is extremely remote owing to the acquittal of the co accused. In the result, this petition is allowed. The proceedings as against the petitioner who is the sole accused in C.C No. 283 of 2015 on the files of the 2016/KER/33664 Cri.M.C.No. 4403 of 2016 4 Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Malappuram shall stand quashed.
