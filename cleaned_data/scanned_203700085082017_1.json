Crl.M.C.No.8508 of 2017 Dated this the 5\" day of January, 2018 ORDER First petitioner had married the second respondent on 11.09.2015. Thereafter, the matrimonial relationship got spoiled leading to the laying of a FIS by the second respondent. It was alleged by her that, she was subjected to matrimonial cruelty by the husband and the in-laws. Accordingly, crime was registered as Crime No.3423 of 2015 of Thrissur Town East Police Station for offences punishable under sections 406, 498A and 34 of the Indian Penal Code. Annexure-A is the FIS. After completion of investigation, final report was laid and the matter is now pending as C.C.No.602 of 2015 of Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Thrissur. 2. Crl.M.C is laid by the accused on a premise that the dispute with the defacto complainant has been completely settled to her satisfaction and both parties have decided to get the matrimonial relationship seperated by due process of law. It is submitted that joint application for judicial separation was filed under section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act and is pending before the Family Court, Thrissur. 3. In the light of the settlement between the parties, no purpose will be served by prosecuting the petitioners herein. 2018/KER/506 Cri.M.C.8508/17 2 Accordingly, Crl.M.C is filed. 4. Learned counsel for the petitioners and learned counsel for the second respondent reiterated the settlement arrived at between the parties on the strength of Annexure-B affidavit filed by the second respondent. Having considered the submission of the learned Public Prosecutor that the matter has been settled between the parties and reported to the police, I am inclined to hold that, no purpose will be served by prosecuting the petitioners herein. In the result, Crl.M.C is allowed. All further proceedings arising from Crime No.3423 of 2015 of Thrissur Town East Police Station in C.C.No.602 of 2015 of Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Thrissur will stand quashed.
