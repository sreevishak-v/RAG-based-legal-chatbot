SMT. SREEJA V. (PP) THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 23.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Biel 2024/KER/5266 CRL.MC 720/2024 2 BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J een ORDER Petitioner is the first accused in S.C.No.1205/2020 on the files of the Additional Sessions Court (Adhoc)-II, Kollam; for the offences punishable under Sections 120(b), 143, 144, 148, 449, 294(b), 506(ii), 341, 323, 324 & 302 r/w Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Subsequently, petitioner was implicated as an accused in Crime No. 1712/2023 of Kollam East Police Station. On 19.01.2024, petitioner has been granted interim bail for the subsequent crime. 2. While the proceedings in S.C.No.1205/2020 were going on before the Sessions Court, and due to the registration of the second crime, petitioner failed to appear before the trial court, apprehending his arrest. Due to his failure to appear before the Sessions Court, a non bailable warrant has been issued against him. Though petitioner was represented Biel 2024/KER/5266 CRL.MC 720/2024 3 through his Counsel, who had even sought for condonation of his absence, the learned Sessions Judge issued a non bailable warrant against the petitioner, which is challenged in this petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. 3. Sri.M.Rajesh, the learned counsel for the petitioner, submitted that petitioner has been granted interim bail on 19.01.2024 in B.A.No.10827/2023; and therefore the apprehension of arrest in the subsequent crime does not subsist. However, since a non bailable warrant has been issued against him, petitioner apprehends that he may be remanded to custody on his appearance before the Sessions Court. It is further submitted that petitioner is willing to cooperate with the trial without fail. 4. Smt.Sreeja V., the learned Public Prosecutor, opposed the application and submitted that petitioner is involved in a serious crime and that he has involved himself in a subsequent crime as well as, and therefore, this Court ought not to issue any direction to consider the bail application in a time bound manner. Bier 2024/KER/5266 CRL.MC_720/2024 4 5. I have considered the rival contentions. 6. It was evident from Annexure-3 that, though the petitioner was directed to appear before the Court on 12.12.2023 and he had appeared through counsel, the Sessions Court had rejected the application for condonation of his absence and issued a non bailable warrant after cancellation of the bail bond. True that petitioner apprehended arrest in the second crime. However, that is not a reason to avoid appearing in court when there was a direction to appear. Considering the circumstances of the case, the omission to appear on the posting date despite a direction by the said Court is a serious omission. However, since petitioner has now offered to appear before the court and participate in the proceedings without fail, I am of the view that circumstances warrant the issuance of a direction to the learned Sessions Judge to consider the application for recall of warrant and for bail, if any, filed by the petitioner, on the same day itself. 7. Accordingly, if the petitioner prefers any application for recall of warrant and for grant of bail on or before Biel bie) pice) Saat 2024/KER/5266 CRL.MC_720/2024 5 02.02.2024, the learned Sessions Judge shall consider the same on the same day itself and pass appropriate orders. The Crl.M.C.is disposed of. sd/- BECHU KURIAN THOMAS JUDGE AMV/23/01/2024 Beas a; eee bie} peta Bats 2024/KER/5266 CRL.MC 720/2024 6 APPENDIX OF CRL.MC 720/2024 PETITIONER ANNEXURES ANNEXURE1 THE TRUE COPY OF THE ORDERS OF THIS HON'BLE COURT IN BA NO. 1237/2023 DATED 30.09.2023 ANNEXURE2 THE TRUE COPY OF THE NOTARIZED AFFIDAVIT DATED 02.12.2023 SUBMITTED BY THE DEFACTO COMPLAINANT WHICH WAS MARKED AS ANNEXURE-3 IN BAIL APPLICATION NO. 10827/2023 ANNEXURES .
