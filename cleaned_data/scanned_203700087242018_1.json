SRI.P.MOHAMED SABAH R1 SRI. AMJAD ALI, SENIOR PUBLIC PROSECUTOR THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 07.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Beta isis ie Crl.MC.No. 8724 of 2018 3 201/KERI692 ORDER This petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (the Code for brevity) with a prayer to quash the proceedings pending against the petitioners. 2. The petitioners herein are accused Nos.1 to 6 in Crime No.677 of 2018 of the Edathala Police Station. In the said case, they stand indicted for having committed offences punishable under Sections 142, 143, 323, 324, 451, 341, 506 and 354 r/w. Section 149 of the IPC. 3. According to the prosecution, on 29.09.2018 at about 6.30 a.m., the petitioners herein attacked the 2 respondent with weapons. 4. I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners, the party respondent and the learned Public Prosecutor. It is submitted that the entire disputes between the parties have been amicably resolved. Reliance is placed on the Bete isis ie Crl.MC.No. 8724 of 2018 4 201/KERI692 affidavit filed by the 2\" respondent to buttress his submission. It is urged that the dispute is purely personal in nature and would not affect public peace or tranquility. 5. The learned Public Prosecutor, on _ instructions, submitted that the statement of the 2 respondent has been recorded and she has stated in clear terms that she has no subsisting grievance. 6. I have considered the submissions advanced. 7. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303] and in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466], the Apex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. 8. The offence committed by the petitioners cannot be said to be grave and serious having ingredients of extreme mental = bs Crl.MC.No. 8724 of 2018 5 201HKERIO22 depravity. It also does not appear that the offence in this case will have a serious impact on the society. It is felt that quashing of proceedings on account of compromise would bring about peace and secure the ends of justice. Even otherwise, persisting with the prosecution would be nothing but a waste of time as the prospects of conviction is bleak. Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I am of the considered view that this Court will be well justified in invoking its extraordinary powers under Section 482 of the Code to quash the proceedings. In the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-Al FIR in Crime No.677 of 2018 of the Edathala Police Station and all proceedings pursuant thereto against the petitioners are quashed.
