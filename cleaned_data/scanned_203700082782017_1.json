TO JUDGE Pn Beuen 2018/KER/721 SUNIL THOMAS, J. 8417, 8429, 8428, 8402 & 8405 of 2017 Dated this the 8\" day of January, 2018 ORDER These Crl.M.Cs. arise from C.C. No.879/2012 of the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Thiruvananthapuram, C.C. No.1033/2014, C.C. No.808/2012, FIR No.490/2014, C.C. No.1917/2013, C.C. No.804/2014, 1119/2014, C.C. No.1228/2012 & C.C.1916/2013, all of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Thiruvalla. 2. Essentially, the disputes between the husband and wife arising out of a matrimonial discord, have triggered the above nine criminal cases. It seems that the matrimonial relationship between the husband and wife ended in a failure, leading to filing of a criminal complaint before the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Thiruvananthapuram alleging matrimonial cruelty. This led to registration of C.C.No.879/2012 for offences punishable under Sections 498A & 34 IPC. Other rival claims between the parties are the subject matter of the other criminal cases. Out of the above, 3 cases are instituted at the instance of the mother-in-law of the wife and 3 by the wife. It seems that E 2018/KER/721 Cri. M. C. Nos. 8278, 8279, 8280, 8281, 8417, 8429, 8428, 8402 & 8405 of 2017 there were other matrimonial proceedings pending before the Family Courts. 3. Pending O.P. No.961/2012 of the Family Court Thiruvalla, the disputes were settled and a compromise was filed before that court as Annexure A2. Annexure A2 discloses that all the disputes between the parties were amicably settled and the parties resolved to give a quietus to the various criminal and other proceedings pending between them. Paragraph 8 and 9 of the above proceedings relate to the specific criminal cases pending between the parties. The above settlement was accepted by the Family Court and Annexure A3 judgment was passed by the court, recording the settlement. It is stated that the parties have thereafter resolved all other disputes and separate orders were passed in the matrimonial proceedings. 4. (Cri.M.Cs. are filed by the petitioners contending that in the light of the settlement between the parties, no purpose will be served by prosecuting the accused and the copy of the compromise has been filed in each of the above case. 5. The learned Public Prosecutors on_ instructions submitted that the statement of the respective de facto E 2018/KER/721 Cri. M. C. Nos. 8278, 8279, 8280, 8281, 417, 8429, 8428, 8402 & 8405 of 2017 complainants have been recorded in six cases and the Police were informed about the settlement of the remaining three criminal cases also. Both the counsel for the petitioners and the learned counsel for the contesting respondents submitted that in the light of the settlement between the parties evidenced by Annexure A2, the respective de facto complainants do not propose to pursue their respective criminal cases. 6. Having considered the rival claims, the fact that the dispute between the parties arose from a matrimonial discord which has now been settled amicably and that all other matrimonial proceedings have been brought to its logical conclusion, | feel that no purpose will be served by prosecuting the accused. The law is settled that in matrimonial disputes, the court shall accept the settlement between the parties and shall give quietus to the criminal cases arising from matrimonial disputes. Hence, | feel that no purpose will be served by prosecuting the respective accused and the criminal cases are liable to be brought to an end. Accordingly, Crl.M.Cs. are allowed. All further proceedings in C.C. No.879/2012 of the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, BEE arate ope 2018/KER/721 Cri. M. C. Nos. 8278, 8279, 8280, 8281, 8417, 8429, 8428, 8402 & 8405 of 2017 4 Thiruvananthapuram, C.C. No.1033/2014, C.C. No.808/2012, FIR No.490/2014, C.C. No.1917/2013, C.C. No.804/2014, 1119/2014, C.C. No.1228/2012 & C.C.1916/2013 all of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Thiruvalla stand quashed. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE. Pn"
