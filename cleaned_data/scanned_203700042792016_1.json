TO JUDGE bp Pan 2016/KER/33877 RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN, V., J. Dated this the 3 day of August, 2016 ORDER 1.The 1* Petitioner is the owner of a lorry bearing Reg.No. KL-40-D-8794. On 3.7.2016, the said vehicle was seized by the 2\" respondent on the allegation that the vehicle was used for transporting ordinary earth, in violation to the provisions under the Kerala Minerals (Prevention of illegal Mining, Storage and Transportation) Rules, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as the Transportation Rules,2015). 2.As per Rule 32 of the Transportation Rules, 2015, any offence punishable under the said rules can be compounded, either before or after the institution of the prosecution, by the person authorized under Section 22 of pee 2016/KER/33877 Cri.M.C. No.4279 of 2016 -2- the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 or clause (ii) of Rule 2 of the Transportation Rules, 2015, to make a complaint to the Court with respect to that offence, on payment to that person, for credit to the Government, of such sum as that person may specify. Referring to Annexure-A2, it is submitted that the 3 respondent is the officer authorised to make a complaint to the Court or to compound the offence. 3.The grievance of the petitioners is that the vehicle has not been produced before the 3% respondent till date. The prayer in this petition is to issue direction to the 2\" respondent to act in terms of the Transportation Rules, 2015 and to produce the vehicle seized before the 3\" respondent. It is further prayed that directions be issued to the 3% respondent to provide an opportunity to the petitioner to compound the offence under Rule 32 of the Transportation Rules, 2015. BIAS ieee 2016/KER/33877 CrI.M.C. No.4279 of 2016 =-3- 4.I have heard the learned Public Prosecutor as well. 5.I find considerable merit in the submission of the learned counsel. It is evident on a reading of Rule 32 of the Transportation Rules, 2015 and also S.R.O No. 375 of 2015 produced by the petitioners that the 3 respondent is the competent authority to prefer complaint before the learned Magistrate and also to allow the compounding of the offence. Hence, the following directions are issued, to secure the ends of justice :- i. The 2 respondent is directed to produce the aforesaid vehicle involved in the offence before the 3% respondent within a period of two days from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. ii. |The 3\" respondent shall permit the petitioners to compound the offence under Rule 32 of the Rules, if the same is permissible under law. iii. The above endeavour shall be completed Drea Bia 2016/KER/33877 CrI.M.C. No.4279 of 2016 -4- within a period of 5 days from the date of receipt of this order. If the offence is compounded in terms of Rule 32 of the Transportation Rules, 2015, necessarily the vehicle shall be released forthwith. This petition is disposed off. Sd/- RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN, V.
