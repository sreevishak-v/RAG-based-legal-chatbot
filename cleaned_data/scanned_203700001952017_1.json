Crl.M.C.No.195 of 2017 Dated this the 10 day of January, 2017 ORDER The main grievance of the petitioner is that the application for interim custody is not being considered and disposed of by the learned magistrate. I find no reason as to why the court below should delay the consideration of the application, having regard to the fact that a vehicle is involved and each day's delay may result in further deterioration of its value. Court below shall take up the matter and dispose it of at the earliest. Crl.M.C is disposed of as above. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS Judge Sbna/10/1/17 True Copy / P A to Judge"
