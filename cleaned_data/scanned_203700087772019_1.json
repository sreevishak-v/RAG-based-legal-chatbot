There were three other accused. The petitioner was absconding and the case against him was split up while trial proceeded against Al, A2 and A4 in S.C 142 of 2010. Vide judgment at Annexure - III dated 29/8/2013, the Sessions Court, Manjeri found the accused who faced the trial not guilty and acquitted them. A discussion of the evidence indicate that there is absolutely no evidence regarding the involvment of the accused who faced trial as also the others. PW1 could not let it any criminal evidence regarding the involvment of the accused. No purpose would therefore be served by proceeding with the trial as against the petitioner.
