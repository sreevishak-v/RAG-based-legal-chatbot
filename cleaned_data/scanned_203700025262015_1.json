Dated this the 5\" day of May, 2015 ORDER The petitioners herein are the accused in C.C.1586/2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Wadakkanchery. They seek orders quashing the prosecution on the ground of amicable settlement of the whole dispute between them and the de facto complainant. Crime in this case was registered under Sections 323, 354, 498(A), 506(1) and 294(b) read with 149 IPC on the complaint of one Soumya, who is the 2\" respondent in this proceeding brought under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. She has filed affidavit to the effect that she has settled the whole dispute with the accused and she has no grievance or complaint now. 2. In so many decisions, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that even in cases involving non-compoundable offences, the High Court can quash the prosecution in pending proceedings, if the parties have really settled the whole dispute amicably out of court, and continuance of prosecution will not serve any purpose in such a circumstance of amicable settlement. Here, | find areal and genuine case of settlement neeae 2015/KER/17577 Cri.M.C. No.2526 of 2015 2 between the parties. This is not a case involving any public interest or public issue. The parties have come to terms amicably on the intervention of persons acceptable to both sides, and | am satisfied that the parties are now on quite cordial terms. In such a_ situation, continuance of the prosecution will not serve any purpose other than wasting the precious time of the court. No doubt, nobody will support the prosecution in such a situation, if the case goes to trial. In the result, this petition is allowed. The prosecution against the petitioners herein in C.C.1586/2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Wadakkanchery will stand quashed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Accordingly, the petitioners will stand released from prosecution and the bail bond, if any, executed by them will stand discharged. Sd/- P. UBAID, JUDGE sd"
