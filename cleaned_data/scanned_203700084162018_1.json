CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 07.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: BSE Bisa Crl.MC.No. 8416 of 2018 2 201/KERI650 ORDER This petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (the Code for brevity) with a prayer to quash the proceedings pending against the petitioners. 2. The petitioners herein are the accused in C.C.No.1377 of 2017 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class-II, Kasaragod. 3. I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners, the party respondent and the learned Public Prosecutor. 4. It is submitted that the entire disputes between the parties have been amicably resolved. Reliance is placed on the affidavit filed by the 2 respondent to buttress his submission. It is urged that the dispute is purely personal in nature and would not affect public peace or tranquility. 5. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted that the statement of the 2\"? respondent has been recorded and she has stated in clear terms that she has no subsisting grievance. Elie Crl.MC.No. 8416 of 2018 3 201SKERIOS0 6. I have considered the submissions advanced. 7. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303] and in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466], the Apex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. 8. The offence committed by the petitioners cannot be said to be grave and serious having ingredients of extreme mental depravity. It also does not appear that the offence in this case will have a serious impact on the society. It is felt that quashing of proceedings on account of compromise would bring about peace and secure the ends of justice. Even otherwise, persisting with the prosecution would be nothing but a waste of time as the prospects of conviction is bleak. Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I am of the considered view that this Court will be well justified in invoking its extraordinary powers under Section 482 of the Code to quash the proceedings. Beet ops Crl.MC.No. 8416 of 2018 4 2019/KERIO50 In the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-I Final Report and all proceedings pursuant thereto against the petitioners in C.C.No. 1377/2017 on the files of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court- II, Kasaragod are quashed.
