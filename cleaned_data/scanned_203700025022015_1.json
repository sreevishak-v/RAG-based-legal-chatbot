The petitioners entered appearance on receipt of summons before the court below through a counsel. Since the petitioners were not in station thereafter, they could not appear before the court below on hearing dates. Now the non- bailable warrant has been issued against the petitioners by the court below. Now the petitioners are ready to surrender before the court below to seek regular bail. | Apprehension of the petitioners is that if he surrenders before the court below, he will be remanded to the judicial custody, pending consideration of the application. I do not think that the Learned Magistrate will remand Beare ae 2015/KER/17263 Crl.M.C.No.2502 of 2015 -2- the petitioners mechanically, without application of mind. Nonetheless, the learned magistrate is directed to consider and dispose of the bail application to be filed by the petitioners on the date of surrender itself. Sd/- K. HARILAL JUDGE Scl.
