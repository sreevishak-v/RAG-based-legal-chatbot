RESPONDENTS EXHIBITS:NIL True Copy /P A to Judge eee 2018/KER/505 SUNIL THOMAS, J. Crl.M.C.No.8505 of 2017 Dated this the 5\" day of January, 2018 ORDER Petitioner herein is arrayed as the 5 accused in Crime No.510 of 2011 of Puthencruz Police Station for offences punishable under sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 323, 324, 506(ii), 294(b) and 149 of the Indian Penal Code. 2. Itis alleged that, due to enmity between two factions of a community, on 24.12.2011 at 11.30a.m, accused formed into an unlawful assembly, pulled out the defacto complainant from his car, abused him and hit him. Specific overt acts were attributed to the accused. Accordingly, crime was registered and after investigation, final report was filed. The matter was taken cognizance of and was pending before the Additional District and Sessions Court, Ernakulam as S.C.No.22 of 2014. Accused, except the petitioner herein, faced the trial before the court below. Learned Sessions Judge by Annexure-4 acquitted all the accused. 3. Petitioner herein has filed this Crl.M.C on a premise that, in the light of the acquittal of the remaining accused by virtue of Annexure-4 judgment, the substratum of the entire prosecution case stands broken and no purpose will be served by prosecuting the petitioner herein. It is further contended that the matter was eee 2018/KER/505 Cri.M.C.8505/17 2 settled with the defacto complainant and the injured evidenced by Annexures-5 and 6 affidavits. Learned counsel for the second and third respondents acknowledged the due execution of the above affidavits and submitted that, they have no objection in quashing the proceedings. Learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted that Annexure-4 was not subject to any appeal and has become final. It is also submitted that the defacto complainant has informed orally that he has executed the affidavits. Annexure-4 judgment shows that, after the examination of PW1, Court found that, he did not stand by the prosecution case. He only said that a group of people assaulted him. He could not identify them. He categorically deposed that the accused therein did not assault him. Having considered the specific version of PW1, learned Public Prosecutor gave up all the remaining witnesses. Consequently, accused, who faced the trial, were acquitted under section 232 of Cr.P.C 4. It is evident that, with this quality of evidence tendered before the trial court, a successful prosecution of the petitioner herein is not possible. Having considered these facts, I am inclined to invoke the jurisdiction under section 482 Cr.P.C to quash the entire criminal proceedings as against the petitioner herein. eee 2018/KER/505 Crl.M.C.8505/17 3 5. It is pertinent to note that the incident happened in the year 2011. Petitioner herein remained absent from the judicial proceedings though all other accused faced the trial. It was submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that he was abroad for earning his livelihood. Having considered these facts, I am inclined to invoke the jurisdiction under section 482 Cr.P.C to quash the criminal proceedings subject to conditions. In the result, Crl.M.C will stand allowed and all further proceedings in S.C.No.902 of 2016 of the Additional District and Sessions Court, Ernakulam as against the petitioner herein will stand quashed on condition that the petitioner herein deposits a sum of Rs.2,000/- (Rupees two thousand only) within a period of 15 days from today with the Kerala Legal Services Authority, Ernakulam and file proof before this Court.
