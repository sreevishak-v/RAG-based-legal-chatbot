No.577/2025 (Crime No.145/2025 of Kovalam Police Station, pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-VII, Neyyattinkara) Petitioner/Accused No.3:- Vishnu.B @ Vichu, aged 20 years, S/o Binu.S, Vishnu Bhavanam, Kuzhivilakathu Veedu, 1045 Vazhamuttam, Thiruvananthapuram 695009 By Advocate:-Alif K.S Respondent:- State of Kerala represented by the Station House Officer, Kovalam Police Station By Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumary This petition came up for hearing on 28/02/2025 and the court on 01/03/2025 passed the following : ORDER This is an application filed by the 3 accused in the above crime under Section 483 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking regular bail. 2. The petitioner/ 3 accused is alleged to have committed the offences punishable under Sections 296(b), 115(2), 118(1), 109 and 351(3), r/w Section 3(5) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. Criminal M.C.No.577/2025 1/6 3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- On 03.02.2025 at about 9 p.m., in connection with kavadi procession of Panathura Subrahmaniya Temple, a scuffle occurred between the defacto complainant and his friends and the accused persons. Infuriated by the same, on 04.02.2025 at about 1 a.m., while the friend of the defacto complainant Akhil was talking with the defacto complainant near his residence, the 1* accused beat Akhil, and when the defacto complainant attempted to obstruct the same, the 1* accused uttered obscene words, and by using a chopper, hacked the defacto complainant on his head and shoulder, and accused Nos. 2 to 4 threatened the defacto complainant and Akhil, and fisted and kicked them. 4. Reportedly, the petitioner/ 3 accused was arrested on 04.02.2025 and he is in judicial custody since then. 5. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The Investigating Officer filed report opposing the bail application. 6. Heard. Perused the records. 7. The only point to be considered is, whether regular bail can be granted to the petitioner/ 3\" accused. 8. The Point:- The petitioner / 3\" accused along with the other accused are alleged to have abused and assaulted the defacto complainant and his friend, Criminal M.C.No.577/2025 2/6 and the 1* accused has, attacked the defacto complainant, using a chopper, causing injuries on his head and shoulder. The motive of the alleged incident is the altercation that occurred between the defacto complainant and his friends and the accused persons, in connection with a temple festival. 9. The petitioner submits that, he is absolutely innocent of the allegations levelled against him and he has been falsely implicated in this case. It is submitted that, the 4\" accused has already been granted anticipatory bail by the Honble High Court, as per order in Bail Application No. 1854/2024, and the petitioner is on the same footing as that of the 4\" accused in this crime. The petitioner has produced the copy of the order passed by the Honble High Court of Kerala in B.A.No. 1854/2025 dated 17.02.2025. 10. The magnitude of the offence alleged is grave. The main allegation is against the 1% accused. The specific overt act alleged against the petitioner/ 3\" accused is that, he had fisted and kicked the defacto complainant and his friend. It is stated in the report filed by the Investigating Officer that, the weapon and the vehicle used for the commission of the offence were recovered, and the wound certificate is obtained. It is seen from the report that the investigation has progressed much. The learned Public Prosecutor has submitted that the 2\" accused is yet to be arrested. However, I find no circumstance to detain the petitioner / 3\" Criminal M.C.No.577/2025 3/6 accused any further for the arrest of the 2\" accused. The petitioner/ 3\" accused is in judicial custody for a period of 24 days. So even if the petitioner/ 3 accused is released on bail, there is nothing much, which will adversely affect the investigation. It is seen from the report that the 4\" accused in this crime was granted pre-arrest bail by the Honble High Court of Kerala vide order in Bail Application No. 1854/2024. It appears that further detention of the petitioner/ 3 accused is not required for the purpose of investigation and that further detention of the petitioner would not meet the interest of justice. No criminal antecedents of the petitioner/ 3\" accused is brought to the notice of this court. Considering the aspects discussed afore, including the stage of investigation, I am of the view that, the petitioner/ 3\" accused can be enlarged on bail subject to conditions. In the result, the petition is allowed and the petitioner/ 3\" accused is granted bail on the following conditions:- (1) Petitioner/ 3 accused shall execute bail bond for Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) with two solvent sureties for the like sum each to the satisfaction of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-VII, Neyyattinkara. (2) Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer on every Tuesday between 10 a.m. and 12 noon for a period of 3 (three) months or till the final report is filed, whichever is earlier. Criminal M.C.No.577/2025 4/6 (3) Petitioner shall not commit any offence while on bail. (4) Petitioner shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade them from disclosing such facts to the court or to any police officer or tamper with evidence. (5) Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer as and when required by the Investigating Officer. (6) Petitioner shall fully co-operate with the investigation. In case of any violation of the above conditions or misuse of liberty, the prosecution or the defacto complainant is at liberty to approach jurisdictional court for cancellation of bail.
