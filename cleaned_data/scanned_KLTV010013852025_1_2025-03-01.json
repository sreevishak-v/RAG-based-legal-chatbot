Geenakumary This petition came up for hearing on 28/02/2025 and the court on 01/03/2025 passed the following : ORDER This is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail. Criminal M.C.No.568/2025 1/7 2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable under Sections 316(2) and 318(4) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, and Crime No. 172/2025 of Karamana Police Station is registered against the petitioner arraying her as the accused. 3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- The accused, with an intention to obtain wrongful gain and to cause wrongful loss to the defacto complainant, offered Scooter for half the price, and on 02.09.2024 at about 4.32 p.m., in the EVM Honda show room situated at Neeramankara, obtained Rs.67,000/-, by way of Google Pay transaction, from the defacto complainant. Thereafter, the accused neither gave the scooter as promised nor returned the money to the defacto complainant, thereby cheated her. 4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The Investigating Officer filed report opposing the anticipatory bail application. 5. Heard. Perused the records. 6. The only point to be considered is, whether an order of anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioner/ accused. Criminal M.C.No.568/2025 2/7 7. The Point:- The petitioner/accused is the Chair Person of Mithram Charitable Trust, Pappanamcode Estate. The petitioner/accused is alleged to have cheated the defacto complainant by illegally obtaining money offering Scooter for half the price, and thereafter, she did not give the scooter to the defacto complainant as promised or retumed the money to her. 8. The petitioner submitted the following:- The petitioner is the Chair Person / Trustee of Mithram Charitable Society, a registered Public Charitable Trust established for the benefit of general public at large. As part of the project, a new scheme namely women on wheels was introduced by the NNGO Confederation, for which, selection of beneficiaries were done through the petitioners organization, and the eligible beneficiaries had voluntarily applied through the online link for the scheme of the NNGO through their portal by using OTP verification, and the choice of the vehicle and its description are also left open to the beneficiaries to choose. As informed by Anantha Kumar and Ananthu Krishnan, the selected beneficiaries are bound to remit fifty percent of their share and the rest of the share will be utilized for the CSR Fund, and the amount collected were duly transferred to the accounts of the implementing agency of the NNGO namely, Grass Root Impact Foundation, Criminal M.C.No.568/2025 3/7 Professional Service Innovations and Socialbee Ventures. Sri. K.N.Anantha Kumar is a well known personality in the field of charity and the Chairman of Sathyasai Orphanage Trust. Under his leadership, during May 2022, a meeting of the NGOs was held and a National NGO Confederation was formed. Sri. K.N.Anantha Kumar was elected as the life time president of the Confederation, Ananthu Krishnan was elected as the National Secretary, and Justice C.N.Ramachandran was chosen as the Patron-in-chief of the said N.N.G.O. Wide publicity was given by the N.N.G.O. Confederation in respect of their charity activities, and in a meeting of the NGOs of Thiruvananthapuram, called during May 2024 at Sai Gramam, near Thonnakkal, the said persons convinced the petitioner and other NGOs that, apart from the beneficiary shares, the remaining amount will be utilized from the C.S.R. fund for charity projects and schemes. The schemes and projects are aimed to uplift the downtrodden women and children in the society. The petitioners Organization was also chosen for the implementation of the projects and schemes of the NNGO Confederation. Believing the words and promises of Anantha Kumar and Anandhu Krishnan, the petitioner bona fidely agreed to act as the implementing agency in respect of the schemes. Because of the wide media coverage and propaganda, without proper and preliminary investigation, the petitioner is arrayed as accused. The petitioner produced copy of Criminal M.C.No.568/2025 Al7 the trust deed, copy of the statement of account, and copy of a petition filed before the Commissioner of Police, Thiruvananthapuram City, against the National NNGO, to substantiate her contentions. 9. There is serious allegation as against the petitioner. Allegedly, the petitioner had illegally obtained money from the defacto complainant, by offering Scooter for half the price, and thereafter, she did not give the scooter as promised or returned the money to her, and thus cheated her. It is seen from the report filed by the Investigating Officer that the investigation is in its preliminary stage. The learned Public Prosecutor submitted that, in this crime, the investigation has not started yet. It is apparent from the bail application that the petitioner had collected Rs.67,000/- from the defacto complainant. The case of the petitioner is that, she had remitted the amount so collected, to the account of professional services Innovations and Socialbee ventures and Grass Root Impact Foundation, which are the implementing agencies of the National NGO Confederation, and the document was produced. The leamed Public Prosecutor submitted that, in spite of the collection of the amount, no receipt was issued to the defacto complainant when it is seen that amount is collected by the petitioner, she owe a liability to fulfill the promise. The prosecution has made out a prima facie case against the petitioner/ accused regarding the involvement of the petitioner in the alleged offence. If the Criminal M.C.No.568/2025 5/7 petitioner/ accused is granted pre-arrest bail, she is likely to influence or intimidate the defacto complainant and other witnesses, and tamper with the evidence. So, the investigation will be adversely affected. The chance of absconding also cannot be ruled out. Considering the facts stated in the report to the effect that the petitioner is involved in the offence, it appears that exceptional jurisdiction to grant a pre-arrest bail cannot be exercised in this case. 10. In Jai Prakash Singh v. State of Bihar and Another (2012 (4) SCC 379), the Apex court has held that, an order of pre-arrest bail being an extra ordinary privilege, should be granted only in exceptional cases. It is settled in law that arrest should be the last option and it should be restricted to cases where arrest is imperative in the facts and circumstances of a case and consistent view is that the grant of anticipatory bail shall be restricted to exceptional circumstances. So it is clear that the power to grant anticipatory bail under section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita. is an exceptional power and should be exercised only in exceptional cases and not as a matter of course. Its object is to ensure that a person should not be harassed or humiliated in order to satisfy the grudge or personal vendetta of the complainant. [Reliance placed on the decision rendered by the Apex Court in HDFC Bank Limited v. J.J. Mannan and Another (2010 (1) SCC 679); Srikant Upadhyay v. State of Bihar (2024 KHC Online 6137)]. In the case Criminal M.C.No.568/2025 6/7 at hand, I find no exceptional circumstance to exercise the exceptional power of granting anticipatory bail. 11. Considering the serious allegation against the petitioners and gravity of the offence, it appears that granting the petitioner with an order of anticipatory bail will adversely affect the investigation. If an order of anticipatory bail is granted, she is likely to influence the witnesses and tamper with the evidence. Considering all these aspects, this court is not inclined to grant an order of pre- arrest bail to the petitioner. In the result, this petition is dismissed.
