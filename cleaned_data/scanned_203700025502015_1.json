ANNEXURE-II: A TRUE COPY OF RECEIPT NO.AG 0664854 DATED 3.3.2015. ANNEXURE-III: AFFIDAVIT DATED 17.04.2015 SWORN BY THE 2ND RESPONDENT. RESPONDENT(S)' EXHIBITS : NIL. TRUE COPY// P.A. TO JUDGE bp irae 2015/KER/17578 P. UBAID, J. Dated this the 5\" day of May, 2015 ORDER The petitioner seeks orders quashing the F.I.R and further proceedings in Crime No.304/2014 of the Chathannoor Police Station, registered under Sections 366(A) & 376 IPC and Section 5j(ii)(i) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, on the complaint of one Ajayakumari. Orders are sought on the ground of amicable settlement of the whole dispute between the accused and the de facto complainant out of court. The victim of offence (Aruna) is the 2nd respondent in this proceeding brought under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It is true that the victim was a minor at the time of the alleged incident. But, now she is major, and she has filed affidavit to the effect that the petitioner herein has married her, and they have been leading a happy marital life. The first informant, who is the 3 respondent herein has also filed affidavit to the effect that she has settled the dispute with the accused, and she has no grievance or complaint now. 2. The learned Public Prosecutor submits, on instructions, that the 2\"? respondent in fact was carrying at the time of the irae 2015/KER/17578 Cri.M.C. No.2550 of 2015 2 alleged incident, and that she is now happy with the petitioner herein as his wife. In such a situation, it will be cruel and unjust to proceed with the prosecution, and | find it appropriate to close the prosecution. In so many decisions, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that even in cases involving non-compoundable offences, the High Court can quash prosecution; be it at the crime stage or at the trial stage, or even atthe appellate or revision stage; if the parties have really settled the whole dispute, or if continuance of prosecution will not serve any purpose. Here, | find a real case of settlement between the parties, and | also find that continuance of prosecution in such a situation will not serve any purpose other than wasting the precious time of the court, when the case ultimately comes before the court. In the result, this petition is allowed. The F.I.R and further proceedings in Crime No.304/2014 of the Chathannoor Police Station will stand quashed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Sd/- P. UBAID, JUDGE sd"
