CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 18.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: 2024/KER/4267 CRL.MC 550/2024 2 BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J a anareneaa ORDER Petitioner seeks to quash the prosecution initiated against him, by invoking the jurisdiction under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. 2. Petitioner is the first accused in C.C.No.177/2021 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Payyannur, arising out of Crime No.315/2019 of Cherupuzha Police Station, Kannur District. Petitioner is being prosecuted for the offences punishable under Section 420 r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. 3. According to the prosecution, the accused had collected more than Rs.60,00,000/- from the de facto complainant and other persons, promising to provide employment in a Five Star Hotel at Malta and thereafter failed to provide the employment and return the amount, thereby committing the offences alleged. 4. The learned counsel submitted that petitioner has absolutely no involvement in the alleged crime and that he is totally Pele shal PlR reat 2024/KER/4267 CRL.MC 550/2024 3 innocent of the allegations. It was further submitted that petitioner has been falsely roped into the crime on the mere allegation that he had directed the de facto complainant to hand over money to the 2 accused. It was submitted that, the said allegation was false, and there is no proof of any nature. It was further submitted that the agreement produced herein as Annexure-A4 reveals that the transaction was solely between the de facto complainant, and the 2\"? accused and the petitioner had no connection whatsoever. 5. I have heard the learned Public Prosecutor, who submitted that the allegations by itself indicate the commission of offences alleged and therefore the jurisdiction under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.cannot be invoked. It was further submitted that, from the contentions advanced itself it was evident that the allegations in the final report, if admitted, would satisfy the ingredients of the offences alleged. 6. I have considered the rival contentions. 7. Petitioner is alleged to have directed the de facto complainant and other persons to pay Rs.60,00,000/- to the 24 accused to 2024/KER/4267 CRL.MC 550/2024 4 enable them to obtain employment in a Five Star Hotel at Malta. It was contended that there was no such direction and that petitioner had no connection at all with the de facto complainant. Though allegedly the 2 accused had issued cheques in purported return of the amounts paid by the complainant, and proceedings under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act has already been initiated by the de facto complainant against the 2\"? accused, I am of the view that those are all matters that can be considered only after trial or at least through a discharge petition. 8. Jurisdiction under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. is exceptional in nature and can be invoked only when the admitted allegations do not make out any offence or that the proceedings are initiated with mala fides, as held in the decision in State of Haryana and others v. Bhajan Lal and others (1992) Suppl. 1 SCC 335. 9. on a perusal of the nature of allegations, it cannot be held that the admitted allegations would not constitute the offence alleged against the petitioner. Therefore, Section 482 of a Ieee 2024/KER/4267 CRL.MC 550/2024 5 Cr.P.C. cannot be invoked by the petitioner. However, if the circumstances enable the filing of a discharge petition, it is open for the petitioner to approach the jurisdictional Magistrate with such a relief. In that view of the matter, this Crl.M.C.is dismissed. sd/- BECHU KURIAN THOMAS JUDGE AMV/19/01/2024 Be aol ese et ee a Bese 2024/KER/4267 CRL.MC 550/2024 6 APPENDIX OF CRL.MC 5500/2024 PETITIONER ANNEXURES ANNEXURE At THE TRUE COPY OF THE FIS IN CRIME NO. 315 OF 2019 OF #CHERUPUZHA POLICE STATION KANNUR DISTRICT.
