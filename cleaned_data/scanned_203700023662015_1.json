ORDER Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners, the learned counsel for the 2 respondent and the learned Public Prosecutor. 2. What is under challenge is the Final Report in C.C.No.784 of 2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Nedumkandom, which has arisen from Crime No.812 of 2014 of the Nedumkandom Police Station, for the offences under Section 277 IPC and Section 120(e) of the Kerala Police Act, 2011. 2016/KER/47 CRL.M.C.No.2366 of 2015 uoe 3. As per the Final Report, the allegation against the petitioners is that they had, with the intention of polluting the drinking water of the 2\" respondent, being obtained from his well, directed waste water into the property of the 2 respondent by causing the over flow of a pipe, which was installed by them, through the drainage, after filling the drainage with soil. It is alleged that the waste water has become over flown from the pipe on account of the unprecedented heavy rainfall and it went on to the property of the 2 respondent, which has polluted the water in the well of the 2\"? respondent. 4. At any stretch of imagination, an offence under Section 277 IPC cannot be attracted in the matter as the property and the well in question are not public properties. With regard to the offence under Section 120(e) of the Kerala Police Act, 2011, it has to be noted that in order to invite such an offence, the accused has to cause defiling of water source or water supply or cause hindrance to public 2016/KER/47 CRL.M.C.No.2366 of 2015 uae sanitation etc. On going through the allegations, it is evident that any of the provisions contained in Section 120(e) of the Kerala Police Act, 2011 cannot be attracted to the present matter. 5. Precisely, the allegation is that on account of unprecedented torrential rain, some water has over flown from the pipe installed. There are no ingredients to invite the offences alleged against the petitioners in the matter. 6. Matters being so, the continued prosecution based on C.C.No.784 of 2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Nedumkandom is quite unnecessary and therefore, all further proceedings in C.C.No.784 of 2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Nedumkandom, which has arisen from Crime No.812 of 2014 of the Nedumkandom Police Station, as against the petitioners, can be quashed. In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and all further proceedings in C.C.No.784 of 2014 of the Judicial First ee apa 2016/KER/47 CRL.M.C.No.2366 of 2015 -4:- Class Magistrate's Court, Nedumkandom, which has arisen from Crime No.812 of 2014 of the Nedumkandom Police Station, as against the petitioners, are hereby quashed.
