HTTRUE COPY// P.S. TO JUDGE rs Dia ee) Borers apa 2017/KER/228 RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN, V., J. Cri.M.C. No.34 of 2017 Dated this the 4\" day of January, 2017 ORDER 1.This petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 2. The petitioner is the accused in Crime No.771 of 2016 of Ramamangalam Police Station registered on the basis of information furnished by the 2 respondent, a minor girl, aged 16 years, alleging commission of offence under Sections 7 and 8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. 3.The petitioner is a Post Graduate student at M.A.College, Kothamangalam. He used to work as a swimming instructor at the MTMHS College, Piravom. The 24 respondent was a student studying for the plus two course 2017/KER/228 Cril.M.C.34/2017 2 in the said college. The prosecution allegation is that the petitioner took the 2 respondent to Piravom park and also to Issac Theatre, Muvattupuzha and committed sexual assault. 4.The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that the crime was registered on account of some misconception and after the registration of the crime, the parties have sat together and have settled the disputes amicably. Reference is also made to Annexure-A3 affidavit signed by the 3 respondent , who is the mother of the 2\"? respondent, to bring home the point that the minor child or the mother has any grievance against the accused. 5.The learned Public Prosecutor would vehemently oppose the submission of the learned counsel and submit that the offence is grave and it will not be in the interest of justice to quash the proceedings on a purported settlement with the mother of the minor girl. 2017/KER/228 Cril.M.C.34/2017 3 6.[ have considered the rival submissions and have anxiously perused the records . 7.Act 32 of 2012 was enacted to prevent the increasing number of sexual offences against children and to give adequate punishment to the offenders and to protect the right of the children guaranteed by the U.N. Convention on Right of Child , 1989 and the Constitution of India. The 2 respondent was aged 16 years at the relevant point of time and the allegation would prima facie disclose a case of sexual assault. The offence committed by the accused is an offence against the society and it is not a matter to be left for the parties to compromise and settle. As the victim was a minor girl, this Court cannot be assured that the consent given is genuine. In cases such as this, the accused will utilize all the resources at his command to pressurize the family members for a compromise. The offence is grave and in that view of the matter, I am unable to accept the compromise arrived at to quash the Bel apa 2017/KER/228 Cril.M.C.34/2017 4 proceedings. 8.It appears from the case diary that the Investigating officer has not so far taken steps to record the statement of the child by a Magistrate. The crime was registered on 6.8.2016, and the delay that has occasioned cannot be countenanced. The officer concerned is directed to expedite the proceedings and to submit the final report before Court. 9.I find no merit in this petition and the same will stand dismissed .
