CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 06.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: oe Crl.M.C.5599/2020 ; 2021/KERISI16 ORDER Dated this the 6th day of January 2021 Petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 2. The petitioners are the accused in Crime No. 744 of 2020 of Aluva Edathala Police Station registered for the offences punishable under Sections 498A, 323 read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code. 3. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioners that the parties have resolved their entire disputes among themselves and as such there is no subsisting dispute between them. Therefore, this petition to quash the Annexure Al FIR in Crime No.744 of 2020 of Aluva Edathala Police Station. 4, Learned counsel appearing for the 1* respondent/defacto complainant has submitted that she has absolutely no grievance or complaints against the petitioners. Annexure A2 is the affidavit sworn to by her in support of the submission of the petitioners. The affidavit further indicates that she has no intention to pursue the matter further. oe Crl.M.C.5599/2020 ; 2021/KERISI16 5. The learned Public Prosecutor has reported that the prosecution has no serious objection in allowing the petition. It is also submitted that as the dispute has been amicably settled, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and therefore, no useful purpose would be served in proceeding with the case. 6. On hearing the submissions of all concerned, on perusal of the records as well on consideration of the special facts and circumstances involved in this case, I find that no fruitful purpose is likely to be served by proceeding with the matter against the petitioners. Moreover, no public interest is involved in the case and there is no legal impediment in granting the prayer as sought for by the petitioners. Therefore, for the purpose of securing the ends of justice, this Crl.M.C. is only to be allowed. For the foregoing reasons, Annexure Al FIR in Crime No.744 of 2020 of Aluva Edathala Police Station and all further proceedings therein will stand quashed as prayed for. Sd/- SHIRCY V.
