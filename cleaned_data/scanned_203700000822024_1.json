M. C. ASHI, PUBLIC PROSECUTOR THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 08.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: PRE: 2024/KER/1157 CRL.MC NO. 82 OF 2024 3 BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J. ~ CrLLM.C.No.82 of 2024 Dated this the 8 day of January, 2024 ORDER Petitioners are accused in C.C.No.1131 of 2021 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Kottarakkara alleging offences under Section 420 r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. 2. According to the prosecution, the accused had, after promising to supply plywood, collected a cheque issued on the Federal Bank bearing No.10189269 for an amount of Rs.6,00,000/- and after encashing the said cheque failed to supply the plywood and thereby committed the offences alleged against them. 3. Sri.Latheesh Sebastian, the learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the allegations against the petitioners do not make out any offence and that a civil suit is pending between the parties as O.S.No.340 of 2021 on the files of the Munsiff Court, Kottarakkara wherein the complainant has sought for recovery of money. According to the petitioner, a pure commercial transaction is attempted to be converted into a criminal case for the purpose of compelling the petitioners to yield to the illegal demands of the defacto complainant. 4. I have heard Sri.M.C.Ashi, the learned Public Prosecutor as well. 5. A perusal of the final report reveals that the cheque issued by the complainant was allegedly encashed by the first petitioner after promising 2024/KER/1157 CRL.MC NO. 82 OF 2024 4 to supply plywood and thereafter failed to supply the same. Even though a civil suit is pending between the parties as O.S.No.340 of 2021, from the nature of allegations, it cannot be prima facie said that it is a pure civil dispute. There can be instances when a civil dispute will also have the trappings of a criminal case. However, those are all matters for appreciation of evidence after due trial. 6. The learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that as far as the 2 petitioner is concerned, there is absolutely no whisper or any material to connect him with the crime. If no materials have been collected by the Investigation to implicate the 2 petitioner, certainly it is a matter which can be appreciated through a discharge petition as well. Therefore, reserving the liberty of the 2 petitioner to invoke the jurisdiction of the learned Magistrate itself, in accordance with law, this Crl.M.C.is dismissed.
