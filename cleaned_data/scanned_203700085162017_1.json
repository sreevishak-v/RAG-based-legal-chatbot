RESPONDENTS EXHIBITS:NIL TRUE COPY P A TO JUDGE 2018/KER/44 SUNIL THOMAS, J. Crl.M.C.No.8516 of 2017 Dated this the 3\" day of January, 2018 ORDER Petitioners are arrayed as accused in Crime No.622 of 2015 of Anchalumoodu Police Station for offences punishable under sections 420, 498A r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code. 2. The allegation of the prosecution is that after the marriage of the first petitioner with the third respondent herein, she was subjected to matrimonial cruelty by the petitioners in connection with demand for dowry. Crime was registered and investigation is progressing. In the meanwhile, petitioners have approached this Court contending that the disputes have now been resolved and the parties have approached the Family Court seeking divorce by filing a joint petition evidenced by Annexure-A4. 3. It seems that the parties have settled the dispute. Learned counsel for the third respondent submitted that she has no objection in quashing the proceedings in the light of the settlement arrived at between the parties. Learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted that the parties have resolved their dispute and the petitioners are not involved in any other crime. Having considered these facts and the fact that the issue arises from a matrimonial discord, I am inclined to invoke the jurisdiction under 2018/KER/44 Crl.M.C.8516/17 2 section 482 Cr.P.C to quash the criminal proceedings. In the result, Crl.M.C is allowed. All further proceedings arising from Crime No.622 of 2015 of Anchalumoodu Police Station will stand quashed.
