SRI. M.C. ASHI (PP) THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 23.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Deere B)eReE et 2024/KER/5269 CRL.MC 722/2024 2 BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J eee i ee ORDER Petitioner seeks for the relief of adjournment of the trial in S.C.No.582/2017 on the files of the Additional Sessions Court- Ill, Mavelikkara by six months. 2. Petitioner is CW2 in the above case. Petitioner is in detention under NDPS Act, and he asserts that he will not be able to give proper guidance for the conduct of the case. 3. The prosecution alleges that on 31.01.2014 the accused had attacked the defacto complainant and another person and thereby committed the offences under Sections 143, 144, 147, 148, 149, 324 and 326 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 apart from Section 20 r/w Section 27 of the Arms Act, 1959. 4. Petitioner is an accused in several crimes, including three NDPS cases, and is now under detention. He contends that he will not be able to conduct the case properly and give proper Baas B)eReE et 2024/KER/5269 CRL.MC 722/2024 3 assistance to the prosecutor, and therefore, wants an adjournment of the trial by six months. It is also submitted that, if the petitioner is permitted to give evidence in the trial, after he is released from detention, he would be able to effectively participate in the trial. 5. Having heard Smt.A.Salini Lal, the learned counsel for the petitioner, as well as Sri.Ashi.M.C., the learned Public Prosecutor, I am of the view that the relief sought for by the petitioner has no merit. 6. The prosecution is primarily conducted by the prosecutor. The investigation has already been completed, and all the materials required for a proper trial have been collected. Though the petitioner is an injured and a witness in the case, he can only provide evidence when called upon to do so. Notwithstanding the fact that petitioner is in detention under the NDPS Act, on the date fixed for evidence, necessary arrangements will be made to enable the court to record his evidence. Petitioner cannot, at this stage, go around collecting evidence or provide any additional material to the prosecutor or to _ the Deere Rea Gets 1 leer 2024/KER/5269 CRL.MC_722/2024 4 investigation. Therefore, the contention that the petitioner will be able to assist the prosecutor more effectively if he is released from detention and, on that basis, the trial ought to be adjourned is highly untenable. Hence, I do not find any merit in those contentions, and this Crl.M.C. is dismissed. 7. Notwithstanding the above dismissal, it will be open to the prosecutor, if he feels it necessary to make any application for adjournment of the trial, to do so. sd/- BECHU KURIAN THOMAS JUDGE AMV/23/01/2024 BRD me ; ae mt d leer 2024/KER/5269 CRL.MC 7722/2024 5 APPENDIX OF CRL.MC 7722/2024 PETITIONER ANNEXURES ANNEXURE 1 COPY OF THE RELEVANT PAGES OF THE FINAL REPORT IN CRIME NO: 276/2017 OF KAYAMKULAM POLICE STATION WHICH [IS PENDING AS S.C NO: 582/17 OF THE ADDL SESSIONS COURT-III, MAVELIKKARA.
