RESPONDENT(S)' EXHIBITS /TRUE COPY/ P.S TO JUDGE bins P.UBAID, J. 2015/KER/1530 Crl.M.C No.4642 of 2014 Dated this the \"13\" January, 2015 ORDER The petitioner herein is the sole accused in Crime No.3904 of 2011 of Ernakulam Central Police Station, registered under Sections 326 and 308 of Indian Penal Code. The case is now pending in committal proceeding before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-ll, Ernakulam as C.P. No.41 of 2012. The defacto complainant,on whose complaint the crime was registered, is one Rajan. Now the petitioner seeks orders under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure quashing the prosecution against him on the ground that he and Rajan have come to terms amicably out of court. The de facto complainant Rajan is the 2\"? respondent in this proceeding. He has filed affidavit to the effect that he has settled the dispute with the accused, and he has no grievance or complaint. Of course, there are materials to attract Section 326 of I.P.C, but | find no definite material for a prosecution under Section 308 of 1.P.C in this case. There is reason to believe that the said section was incorporated by the Police on the basis of a mee iS B.S bins 2015/KER/1530 Crl.M.C No.4642 of 2014 2 hypothetical statement. 2. In so many decisions, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that even in cases involving non-compoundable offences, the High Court can quash prosecution, if the parties have really settled the dispute, and continuance of prosecution will not serve any purpose. Here, | find a real and genuine settlement between the parties. In such a situation, it is definite that continuance of prosecution will be a sheer waste of time, because nobody will support the prosecution, if the case goes to trial. In the result, this petition is allowed. The prosecution against the petitioner herein in Crime No.3904 of 2011 of Ernakulam Central Police Station, now pending in committal proceeding before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court- I,Ernakulam as C.P. No.41 of 2012, will stand quashed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Accordingly, the petitioner will stand released from prosecution, and the bail bond, if any, executed by him will stand discharged. Sd/- P.UBAID JUDGE ma /True copy/ P.S to Judge"
