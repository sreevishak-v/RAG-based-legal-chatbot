RESPONDENT'S EXHIBITS: NIL R.AV HTRUE COPYII PATO JUDGE Drea a SUNIL THOMAS, J. EE Dated this the 3\" day of January, 2017 ORDER The petitioner is the defacto complainant in CC.No.1072/2009 of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Koyilandy for offences punishable under Sections 465, 466, 469, 471 and 417 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. The defacto complainant was examined as PW5. The matter was thereafter posted for hearing. It seems that at the time of hearing, interpretation was given by one of the counsel, regarding a sentence in the deposition of PW2. On the basis of that contentions, an application to recall PW2 was filed by the APP. The court below by its order in Annexure-C order dismissed the application filed under Section 311 of the Cr.P.C. This was carried in revision before the Sessions court in Crl.R.P.No.105 of 2015. The revisional court accepted the view taken by the court below and dismissed the revision. This is under challenge in this Crl.M.C. 2. Heard both sides and examined the records. Drea sormenny Crl.M.C.No.102 of 2016 2 The disputed sentence is extracted of the order, at page 21. The contentions of both sides before the courts below as well as before this court revolved around the correct interpretation and the purport of that portion of deposition. In the course of deciding the application under Section 311 of Cr.P.C, both courts were inadvertently dragged to express their interpretation of that sentence, which I feel was unnecessary and unwarranted. Definitely both courts could not have refrained from venturing into that since the courts were invited by both sides to render its finding on that portion of deposition. 3. I feel that this exercise was. absolutely unnecessary in the absence of any allegation that the evidence of PW2 was not correctly recorded or that there was any ambiguity in the mode of recording by the court below. It is for the trial court at the time of final hearing to decide what exactly did the witness mean by that portion of deposition. The courts are not expected to cull out a sentence from the deposition and to give an Drea sormenny Crl.M.C.No.102 of 2016 3 opinion, de hors the circumstances under which that evidence was given. Evidently deposition has to be appreciated as a whole. By calling upon the court to give its opinion regarding that sentence, virtually the parties were preempting the issue which did not arise at that stage of S.311 Cr.P.C. Having regard to this fact, I feel that there is no scope for recalling the witness and it is for the trial court at the time of final hearing to consider the true intention of the witness, the correct explanation of that portion of deposition and the circumstances under which the witness gave that answer. It is to be independently considered by the trial court, untrammeled by any observation and any comments made by both the courts below. In the light of above, this Crl.M.C fails and is dismissed. The court below shall proceed to pronounce the judgment on the basis of evidence let it. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE RAV ITRUE COPY/I PATO JUDGE"
