BY ADV. SRI.BIJOY KURUVILLA OTHER PRESENT: SMT. REKHA C. NAIR SR. PP. THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 09.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Blast CrLMC:8856/18 3 2019/KER/1251 ORDER The petitioners herein are the accused in Crime No. 1243 of 2018 of the Pulikeezhu Police Station registered for offences punishable under Sections 143, 144, 147, 149, 294(B), 506, 427, 323, 324 and 307 of the IPC. 2. According to the prosecution, the petitioners herein formed an unlawful assembly and in prosecution of their common object, trespassed into the house of the de facto complainant on 5.11.2018 at about 5.30 p.m. and attacked her husband and other family members with weapons. It is also alleged that mischief was committed by the accused causing a loss to the tune of Rs.1,79,000/-. 3. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would submit that the petitioner as well as the de facto complainant and others are near relatives. Only minor injuries were sustained by the victims. Without taking note of the nature of injuries, the investigating officer has incorporated Section 307 of the IPC. Itis further contended that parties were litigating in the civil court in respect of a pathway leading to the property of the petitioners. According to the learned counsel, in the course of proceedings, the ote CrLMC:8856/18 4 2019/KER/1251 entire disputes have been settled and the parties are now living in peace and harmony. The de facto complainant and the other injured have filed separate affidavits before this court asserting that they have no subsisting grievance and they have no objection in terminating the criminal proceedings. 4. The learned counsel appearing for the party respondents would contend that the crime was registered due to _ the circumstances prevailing then. It is submitted that the entire disputes have been settled and the party respondents have no further grievance. 5. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted that the statements of the victims have been recorded and they have stated in unmistakable terms that they have no further grievance. 6. Ihave considered the submissions advanced and have gone through the statement of the witnesses and also the wound certificate. Except for one Mary Kutty Kurian, the other witnesses have sustained only contusions. Mary Kutty Kurian has suffered a lacerated wound in the occipital region of the scalp, which injury ote CrLMC:8856/18 5 2019/KER/1251 cannot be said to be serious. 7. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303] and in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466], the Apex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. 8. The offence committed by the petitioners cannot be said to be grave and serious having ingredients of extreme mental depravity. Though Section 307 has also been incorporated, the injury sustained cannot in any way be regarded as serious. The parties are members of the same family and they have managed to iron out their entire disputes and to live in peace and harmony. It also does not appear that the offence in this case will have a serious impact on the society. It is felt that quashing of proceedings on account of compromise would bring about peace and secure the ends of justice. Even otherwise, persisting with the prosecution would be nothing but a waste of time as the prospects of conviction is bleak. Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I am of the considered view that this Court will be well justified in invoking its extraordinary Berl iene Ble a Crl.MC:8856/18 6 201/KER/1ISI1 powers under Section 482 of the Code to quash the proceedings. In the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-Al FIR in Crime No. 1243 of 2018 of the Pulikeezhu Police Station and all proceedings pursuant thereto against the petitioners are quashed.
