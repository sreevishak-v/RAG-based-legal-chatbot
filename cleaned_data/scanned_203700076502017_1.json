NO 2414/2015 ON THE FILE OF THE CHIEF JUDICIAL MAGISTRATE COURT, THRISSUR /TRUE COPY/ P.S. TO JUDGE 2018/KER/251 B.SUDHEENDRA KUMAR, J. Cril.M.C. No. 7650 of 2017 Dated this the 4th day of January, 2018 ORDER The petitioner is the accused in S.T. No. 2414 of 2015 on the files of the court below. The petitioner filed CMP No. 2892 of 2017 under Section 311 Cr.P.C. before the court below praying for issuing summons to the eight witnesses shown in the witness list. The court below, as per Annexure -A, did not permit the accused to examine witness Nos. 2 to 4 in the witness list. Aggrieved by the said order, this Crl.M.C. has been filed. 2. Heard both sides. 3. Admittedly, witness No. 2 in the witness list is the daughter of the sister of the present complainant. Witness No. 3 is the daughter and witness No. 4 is the mother of the complainant in this case. Crl.M.C. No. 7650 of 2017 _2- 4. The liability involved in this case arose out of a contract in respect of the construction of the house of the complainant. The complainant contended that the husband of fhe accused failed to carry on the construction work and hence, the accused had undertaken the liability of her husband and issued the cheque in question. In order to prove that the construction was already started, the petitioner wanted fo examine the above said witnesses. 5. The court below found that if the accused wanted to prove fhe construction work, he could do so by examining the workers or others who were employed for doing the construction work. The court below further rightly observed that for proving the construction work of a house, the daughter and the mother of the owner of the house are not required. The court below further observed that the intention of the petitioner was to harass the relatives of the complainant. Having gone through the relevant inputs, this Court is of the view that in order fo prove the construction of the house, the petitioner can Eevee 2018/KER/251 Crl.M.C. No. 7650 of 2017 _3- very well examine any of his workers. In the said circumstances, issuing summons to witness Nos. Z fo 4 is totally unnecessary. On the facts of the case, this Court is of the view that the intention of the petitioner in this regard is only to cause harassment to the complainant. Having gone through Annexure-A order, I find no reason to hold that the said order suffers from any illegality, impropriety or incorrectness, warranting interference by this Court. In this result, this Crl.M.C. stands dismissed. B.SUDHEENDRA KUMAR, JUDGE. ari/"
