CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 10.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Diep ines CRL.MC NO. 150 OF 2024 EE BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J. ~CriLM.C. No.150 of 2024 Dated this the 10\" day of January, 2024 ORDER Petitioner is the 2\"? accused in Crime No.186 of 2011 of Kadakkavoor Police Station, now pending as C.C No.246 of 2022 of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-l, Varkala. The offences alleged against the petitioner are under Section 342 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. 2. According to the prosecution, the defacto complainant, who is the Secretary of the Panchayat, was wrongfully restrained by accused Nos.1 and 2, since he refused to give a copy of the minutes and thereby, the accused committed the offences alleged. 3. Sri. Sherry J. Thomas, the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that, the case against the 1** accused was compounded by order dated 08.11.2016 and the benefit of such compounding ought to be extended to the petitioner as well. She further submitted that, by virtue of compounding of the offences as against the 1* accused, Section 34 of the IPC 2024/KER/1463 CRL.MC NO. 150 OF 2024 cannot be attracted as well, and on that basis the case is required to be quashed. It was further pointed out that, in any event, the 2\" respondent is willing to settle the matter and therefore, the proceedings in the trial court ought to be quashed. 4. | have heard Sri. Noushad K.A., learned Public Prosecutor as well. 5. The prosecution allegation is that, the Panchayat Secretary was restrained by the President of the Panchayat as well as a Ward member on 28.03.2011. The case as against the President of the Panchayat, who was arrayed as the 1* accused was compounded as evident from Annexure-A3_ order. However, the case against the petitioner, who was a Ward member was not compounded, which indicates that the 2\" respondent intended to proceed against the petitioner. 6. Though the case against the 1* accused has been compounded, the same by itself cannot wipe away the offence under Section 342 of the IPC. Of course whether Section 34 of IPC would be applicable due to the compounding is a matter to be considered after trial. The allegations in the final report indicates the commission of an offence, at least, prima facie, 2024/KER/1463 CRL.MC NO. 150 OF 2024 whether any offence is proved or not is a matter to be decided after evidence is adduced. Considering the fact that, the crime is of the year 2011 and till date, no settlement has been arrived at between the petitioner and the defacto complainant, it is not proper for this Court to issue notice to enquire whether the 2\" respondent is willing to settle the matter or not. Therefore, | find no merit in this Criminal M.C.,and it is dismissed. Sd/- BECHU KURIAN THOMAS JUDGE LU Bel Biren 2024/KER/1463 CRL.MC NO. 150 OF 2024 ..5..
