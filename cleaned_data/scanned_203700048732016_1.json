No. 4873 of 2016 Dated 1* August, 2016 ORDER 1.The petitioner is the accused in L.P.No.37 of 2009 of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Thrissur. He along with 4 others were initially charge sheeted by the Assistant Sub Inspector of Police, Trissur East Police Station in Crime No.349 of 1998 alleging offences punishable under Sections 408 and 420 read with Section 34 of the IPC. 2.The learned counsel submits that all the other accused except the petitioner were acquitted as per Annexure B judgment. The petitioner was not available for trial and the case against him was split up and re-filed and later the case was included in the list of long pending case as above. The petitioner seeks for issuance of appropriate directions to the learned Magistrate to consider his application for recall of warrant and grant of Bail on the date of surrender itself and to grant him Bail. 2016/KER/33672 Crl.M.C. No.4873 of 2016 -2- 3.It was owing to the contumacious conduct of the petitioner, that Non Bailable Warrant was issued against him to secure his presence before the court below. This court in exercise of powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure will not be justified in interfering with the discretion of the learned Magistrate in granting bail. 4.It is for the petitioner to approach the learned Magistrate and appraise the reasons for his absence and to seek for recalling the warrant and grant of Bail. There is no reason for this Court to assume that the learned Magistrate will not exercise his discretion judicially and in accordance with law. 5.In the result, the petitioner is directed to surrender before the learned Magistrate within 3 weeks from the date of this order and prefer application for recall of warrant and also for grant of bail with advance notice to the prosecutor concerned. In that event the learned Magistrate is directed Peel a 2016/KER/33672 Crl.M.C. No.4873 of 2016 -3- to consider and dispose of the said application, preferably on the same day itself, on its merits and in accordance with law. Coercive proceedings, if any, shall be kept in abeyance till then. Petition is disposed off as above. Sd/- RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.YV., JUDGE kp/-1.8.16"
