KEMAL PASHA, J. ~ Cri.M.C.Nos.1602 and 1866 of 2016 Dated this the 5\" day of January, 2018 ORDER The petitioners are accused Nos.1 and 2 respectively in C.C.No.236/2014 of the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court, Ernakulam based on the final report in Crime No.1814/2014 of the Ernakulam Central Police Station for the offences under Sections 406, 418, 420 and 426 IPC. 2. In brief, the allegation is that the petitioners have not paid the entire commission as agreed by them based on an agreement to CWl1. 3. On going through the matter, it seems that, at the most the liability has arisen from a breach of contract and nothing more, for which civil action alone is maintainable. When it is only a breach of contract, the offences alleged against the petitioners are not legally sustainable. Therefore, all further proceedings in C.C.No.236/2014 of the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court, Ernakulam as against the petitioners herein are hereby quashed. Sd/- B. KEMAL PASHA, JUDGE. ne // True Copy // P.A. to Judge"
