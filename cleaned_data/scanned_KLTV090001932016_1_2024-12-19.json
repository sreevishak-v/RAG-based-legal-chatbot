Description o f the Accused Occupati SLNo Name Father's Name on Residence Age Gopalakrishnan | - | = Nemom___[_35_| 2 Dates of Occurrence Report Apprehensi | Releaseon | Commence Close Sentence on or bail ment of trial or appearance of or Complaint trial Order This case having been finally heard on 17.12.2024 and this Court on the 19.12.2024 delivered the following: - JUDGEMENT This is a case instituted upon the final report filed by the Sub Inspector of Police, Karamana Police Station in Crime No. 248/2012 u/Ss.294(b), 188, 323 and 354 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The sole Accused herein is the husband of the Informant. 2. The Prosecution allegation is that on 07.03.2012, the Accused in violation of the Protection Order passed in favour of the Informant herein, slapped the Informant on her face, showered obscene words on her, outraged her modesty thereby and committed the offences punishable under Sections 294(b), 188, 323 and 354 of the Indian Penal Code (hereinafter referred to as the IPC). 3. On the basis of the final report, cognizance was taken in respect of the offences under Sections 294(b), 323 and 354 of the IPC. Ingredients of the Offence under Section 188 of the IPC were found to be not made out. On issuance of process, the Accused entered appearance. After preliminary hearing, charge was framed for the offences under Sections 294(b), 323 and 354 of the IPC. It was read over and explained to the Accused to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. 3 4, From the side of Prosecution, CWs 1, 2, additional witness (as per Order in C.M.P. No. 3126/2024) and CW5 were examined as PWs 1 to 5 respectively and Exhibits P1, Pi(a), P2 to P7 were marked. Pursuant to closure of evidence of the Prosecution, the Accused was examined under Section 313(1)(b) of the CrPC wherein he denied all the incriminating circumstances adduced against him by the Prosecution. No Defence evidence was adduced by the Accused. 5. Heard both sides. The following points arise for consideration: (i) Has the Accused by uttering obscene words against her and thereby committed the offences punishable under Sections 294(b) of the IPC? (ii) | Has the Accused voluntarily caused hurt to PW1 by slapping on her face and thereby committed the offence punishable under Section 323 of the IPC? (iii) Has the Accused intentionally outraged the modesty of the Informant by using criminal force on her and thereby committed the offences punishable under Section 354 of the IPC? (iv) If so, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded? 6. Point(a): The injured was examined as PW1 and her FIS marked as Exhibit P1. To prove the incident, CW2, the occurrence witness was examined as PW2. The Investigating Officer, PW3, recorded Exhibit P1 statement and Exhibit P1(a) body note and on the basis of the same, registered Exhibit P2 FIR. He further prepared Exhibit P4 scene Mahazar, Exhibit P5 Arrest Memo recording the arrest of the Accused, Exhibit P6 Bail Bond, and Exhibit P8 Address Report. The Wound Certificate was initially marked subject to proof through PW3. Since it was reported from the side of Prosecution that the presence of CW5, the doctor who had examined PW1 could not be procured as he was unavailable, the Superintendent, General Hospital Trivandrum was examined as 4 PW4 for the purpose of proving the Exhibit P7 Wound Certificate as per Order in C.M.P. No. 3126/2024. Subsequently, PW5 mounted the box and proved Exhibit P7. PW1, deposed that on 07.03.2012 at 10:00 AM in front of her house at Kaladi, when she resisted the Accused from take away their child, he slapped on her left cheek thereby causing her to fall down and further abused her with the words ajeneajl enon, aggaamg gatos! and kicked her twice or thrice. PW2, the occurrence witness also deposed. in support of the said version that he witnessed the same and heard the Accused abusing PW1. The Learned Counsel for the Accused would argue that the Prosecution has not been able to prove that the alleged abusive words were of such a nature that is lascivious, appealing to the prurient interest or capable of arousing sexually impure thoughts in the minds of its hearers and therefore the offence under Section 294(b) of the IPC is not attracted. The Learned APP on the other hand, would contend that the alleged abusive words have been categorically deposed to by PW1 in her FIS as well as before this Court and the said incident has occurred in front of her house on a Pongala day and CW2 has also deposed to have heard the Accused abusing the PW1. She further submits that no questions or suggestions put forth from the side of the Defence as to whether the said words are lascivious or otherwise. In order to attract the offence under Section 294(b) of the IPC, it is essential the following ingredients have to be satisfied- (i) the offender has uttered any obscene word. in or near any public place and (ii) the same has caused annoyance to the others. In addition, the words so uttered must be of such a nature that it must be lascivious, appealing to the prurient interest or capable of arousing sexually impure thoughts in the minds of its hearers. To establish an offence under Section 294(b) of the IPC, all these conditions have to be satisfied conjunctively and not alternatively. See, James Jose v. 5 State of Kerala, 2019 (3) KHC 531; Sangeetha Lakshmana v. State of Kerala, 2008 (2) KLT 745; Latheef v. State of Kerala 2014 (2) KHC 604 Here, admittedly the place of alleged occurrence is house compound of PW1. It is true that the alleged abusive words have been categorically deposed to by PW1. However, it is to be noted that even if the place of occurrence is taken to be near a public place, considering the fact that the alleged date of occurrence was pongala day; it has not come out from the evidence either of PW1 or of PW2 that the alleged abusive words caused annoyance to them or to anyone else who had heard the same and that it was of such a nature that it was lascivious, appealing to the prurient interest or capable of arousing sexually impure thoughts in their minds. Furthermore, PW2 deposed that he heard and saw the Accused allegedly abusing PW1, but the words thereto are not deposed by him, nor has he deposed that the same had caused annoyance to him. This Court is unable to accept the contention of the Learned APP that no such questions as to the nature of the alleged abusive words were put forth by the Defence. The reason being that, the onus on the Defence arises only when the Prosecution has discharged its initial burden to establish the ingredients of the alleged offence, which is conspicuously absent in the present case. Hence this Court finds that the ingredients of the said offence are not attracted in the present case and this point is found in favour of the Accused. 7. Point (b) and (c): These points are considered together for the sake of brevity and to avoid repetition. PW1, the injured, deposed that she gave Exhibit P1 Statement to the police to the effect that she has been injured by the Accused, who is her husband on 07.03.2012 at 10:00 AM in front of her house at Kaladi. She deposed that the Accused attempted to take away their child and she resisted him, whereby he slapped on her left cheek thereby causing her to fall down. He further uttered obscene word against her and 6 kicked her twice or thrice. Hearing her scream when she got kicked by him, people gathered and the Accused left the kid there and ran away. The said act of the Accused caused her mental agony and she got defamed. She deposed that she got injured in the incident and that she sustained contusions on her face and thigh. According to her, the trial was proceeding in the case filed by her against him under Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (hereinafter referred to as the DV Act) and she secured a Protection Order in her favour prior to this incident, which is the reason for the alleged act of the Accused. She deposed that she took treatment from General Hospital Thiruvananthapuram and that the delay of two days in intimating the police occurred because of the reason that it was Aattukal Pongala on the said day and the roads were blocked and further that her two-year daughter had an offering on that day. PW2 deposed to have witnessed the incident on 07.03.2012. According to him, he went along with CW3, his friend, to the home of PW1 as his sister was also having Pongala offering on that day and they came to witness the same. While he was near the car porch, he heard the cry of the kid and also that of PW1. He went there and saw the Accused having slapped on the cheek of PW1 and her having fallen down, kicked by him twice on her left leg and further the Accused having uttered abusive word to her and told her to get off. By the time he rushed there, the Accused had run away. The other ladies took her inside and he came to know that she got injured. But he did not care much attention as it was on the legs. He gave statement to the police on 09.03.2012. PW3 deposed that he had recorded Exhibit P1(a) body note of PW1 and her left cheek was found to ben swollen on 09.03.2012. PW5, the Doctor deposed that he had examined PW1 on 09.03.2012 with an alleged history of assault by her husband at the home and that she had complained of body ache alone and there were no external injuries noted on the examination and further that in his opinion, the injury could be as alleged. 7 The Learned Counsel for the Accused would argue that the ingredients of Section 323 of the IPC are not established in the present case. It is contented that according to PW1, she got injured and sustained contusion on her face and thigh. However, as per the deposition of PW5, PW1 had complained of body ache only and there are no internal or external injuries noted on the person of PW1. Thus, the alleged injuries stated to have been sustained by PW1 have not been corroborated by the medical evidence and that it is PW5 who had deposed that PW1 complained of body ache, and PW1 has no such case that she had any body ache. Further, as regards the swelling on her cheek recorded in Exhibit P1(a), the Learned Counsel for the Accused drew the attention of this Court that no such swelling could be noted by the medical expert, when PW5 examined her and that the body note was in fact recorded on the same day afternoon prior to examination by the doctor in the evening, which is only a matter of difference of a few hours in between. The Learned Counsel for the Accused also submits that there is a delay in registration of the crime and examination by the Doctor, which were held on 09.03.2012 and the delay is not sufficiently explained. It is the specific case of the Accused that this case is only an offshoot of the ongoing matrimonial disputes between the parties. The investigation according to the Accused was conducted without even a preliminary enquiry as regards whether the alleged Protection Order was communicated to the Accused or not, especially when it is admitted by PW1 that there are ongoing matrimonial disputes between PW1 and the Accused. The Learned Counsel points out that PW2 is an interested witness, for the reason that he is a close relative of PW1 and his evidence is not believable as he denied. knowledge as to the ongoing disputes between the Accused and PW1, when he had so admitted the same to the Investigating Officer in his statement and when PW1 herself admits the said fact of his knowledge thereto. It is further submitted that there is discrepancy in the Exhibit P3 Scene Mahazar as the same is seen to have been prepared 8 on the date of occurrence itself when the consistent case of Prosecution is that Crime was registered on 09.03.2012 and there is not report from the side of the Investigating Officer pointing out that the same was a bonafide mistake. Per contra, the Learned APP points out that PW1 has categorically deposed that on the said date and at the said time, in front of her house, the Accused slapped on her left cheek, when she resisted the attempt of the Accused in taking away their chid, thereby causing her to fall down and that he further uttered obscene words to her and kicked her twice or thrice. She deposed that she sustained injuries and that she was treated at the General Hospital. The said act of the Accused causing injury to PW1 is deposed to have been witnessed by PW2. It is further substantiated from the evidence of PW3, the I.O. on basis of Exhibit P1(a) body note that there was swelling found on the left cheek of PW1 and also Exhibit P7 Wound Certificate proved through PW5 Doctor. The Learned APP would argue that in order to attract Section 323 of the IPC, even pain is sufficient and that PW1 has deposed that she sustained injuries, supported by Exhibit Pl(a) body note recording the existence of swelling on her left cheek and Exhibit P7, read with deposition of PW5 that PW1 had complained of body ache. The Learned APP contends that the delay herein has more specifically been explained by PW1 herself that there was an offering in the name of her child on the same day, roads were blocked due to Pongala and there were no police aid posts for the said reason. She further argues that communication of Protection Order is immaterial in this case for the reason that, even if for arguments sake, it is taken that there was non-communication of the same to the Accused, the alleged act of the Accused, i.e.; slapping, showering obscene words and kicking PW1, for whatever reason, would make the factum of non- communication inconsequential. It is further submitted that PW2 cannot strictly be said to be an interested witness merely for the reason that he is a relative of the Informant. His presence thereon was natural as he had come to the alleged place of occurrence to 9 witness the said Pongala, as his sister was also having Pongala offering in the house of the Informant and is a possible eye-witness. I have carefully gone through the materials on record, and considered the submissions of the Learned APP and the Learned Counsel for the Accused. This Court is unable to accept the contention of the Learned Counsel for the Accused that there was not even a preliminary enquiry as regards whether the alleged Protection Order was communicated to the Accused or not, especially when it is admitted by PW1 that there are ongoing matrimonial disputes between PW1 and the Accused. It is true that PW1 has admitted that there are on-going matrimonial disputes between the parties and even relating to the custody of the child. The alleged act of the Accused, as rightly pointed out by the Learned APP, if proved and substantiated, would make the fact of non-communication of the Protection Order, if any, inconsequential for the reason that use of force cannot be justified except under the existence of exceptional circumstances such as exercise of right of private defence etc., and that too unless it falls within the specific parameters laid down by law in force. Pertaining to the question of PW2, being an interested witness, this Court dispel the contention of the Learned Counsel for the Accused that he is an interested witness. It is well settled that a close relative who is a very natural witness, cannot be regarded as an interested witness under all circumstances. He must be a witness who derives some benefit from the result of a litigation (See Shinoj and Others v. State of Kerala, 2019 KHC 862). Merely for the reason that PW1 admitted him to be her close relative, and his denial as to the knowledge of the on-going matrimonial disputes between the parties, would not make him an interested witness. The contradiction in his deposition as regards his knowledge as to matrimonial disputes (Exhibit D3) stand proved through examination of PW3. That would in view of this Court would definitely throw doubt as to his veracity but cannot be said to be an interested witness as his presence thereon 10 was natural. The possibility of him being the only available witness however cannot be inferred in the present case for the reason that even according to PW1, people had gathered hearing her scream, and according to PW2, PW1 was taken by other ladies pursuant to being injured. As regards the delay, this Court is of the view that the same has not been properly explained. It is true that PW1 deposed that since it was Pongala there weren't any police aid post and she had an offering in the name of her child. However, the same reason for not getting herself treated for two days, despite said alleged contusions on her face and thigh definitely throws doubt on the case of Prosecution. On appreciation of evidence of Prosecution Witnesses as regards ingredients of offence punishable under Section 323 of the IPC, it is seen that PW1 has categorically deposed as to the alleged overt act by the Accused, i.e., slapping and kicking her, as rightly pointed out by the Learned APP and the same is specifically substantiated by the evidence of PW2. During cross-examination, PW2 deposed that the incident occurred so spontaneous that he couldnt interfere in between and resist the Accused. It is true that swelling is seen noted in Exhibit Pl(a) and PW5 also admitted that the patient had alleged of body ache. It is however pertinent to note that according to PW1, she got injured and the injuries sustained by her are contusions on her face and thigh. No external injuries to the effect as alleged by PW1 is seen to have been noted by PW5 who had examined her on 09.03.2012 evening. Despite deposition by PW5 that PW1 had complained of body ache, she herself has no case that the alleged act had caused any pain, bodily disease or infirmity to her. She has no case that by the time she went to the hospital her alleged contusions had been healed. Admittedly, she gave Exhibit P1 Statement and got herself treated one day later from the alleged date of occurrence and both these happened simultaneously, one after the other. Exhibit Pl(a) by PW3 is of course prior in point of time denoting swelling on the left cheek of PW1, which is 11 specifically not seen reflected in the examination by PW5, the Doctor on the same day after a few hours. PW1 never had a case that the alleged act of Accused caused swelling on her left cheek and the same suddenly got healed by the time she reached the hospital by evening. PW3, to the specific suggestion put forth in the cross-examination in the said regard, admitted that there are no injuries, not even swelling noted by PW5 during the examination of PW1. It is at this juncture that the Learned Counsel for the Accused pointed out that even if the evidence of PWs 1 and 2 is taken on its face value, the offence punishable under Section 323 IPC is not attracted as the fact that hurt was caused by the Accused by the alleged act itself is not proved by the Prosecution. This Court finds considerable force in the contention of the Learned Counsel for the Accused the offence punishable under Section 323 IPC is not attracted as PW1 has not deposed that in consequence of the alleged act thereof she sustained any bodily pain, disease or infirmity. It is settled that in order to bring an act within the definition of hurt the same should cause bodily pain, disease or infirmity to any person. To prove an offence under Section 323 IPC, the Prosecution has to necessarily prove that the alleged act has also caused bodily pain, disease or infirmity to any person. See Padmakumar v. State of Kerala, 2024 KER 8129. PW1 has not deposed to the effect that she sustained any bodily pain, disease or infirmity. The injuries deposed to have been sustained by her is not corroborated by PW5, the Doctor. Hence, in absence of statement of PW1 that she sustained any bodily pain, disease or infirmity on account of the alleged act of Accused, this Court finds that Prosecution has failed to substantiate and prove its case that ingredients of offence punishable under Section 323 IPC is attracted. This point is therefore answered in favour of the Accused. To attract the offence punishable under Sections 354 of the IPC, it is incumbent that following ingredients have to be established: (i) the offence must be against a 12 woman (ii) there must be use of criminal force or assault against a woman, and (iii) use of such force or assault must be with an intention or knowledge that it would outrage her modesty. Mere vague statements are not sufficient to establish the said intention. The Learned Counsel for the Accused points out that from the deposition of PW3, it is admitted that the said offence was charge although it was ascertained that Accused was the husband of PW1 and it is also argued that the intention thereof, which is sine qua non for attracting the alleged offence is not seen proved or established. Here, there is nothing on the materials on record, either in the Final Report, deposition of the witnesses or otherwise to attribute such an intention as contemplated under Section 354 of the IPC. Hence, this point is also answered in favour of the Accused. 8. Point (d): In view of the above, resultantly, this Court finds that the Prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The Accused is found. not guilty of having committed the offences punishable under Sections 294(b), 323 and 354 of the IPC and is acquitted thereof under Section 248(1) of the CrPC. His bail bond stands cancelled and he is set at liberty.
