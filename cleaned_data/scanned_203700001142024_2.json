CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 22.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Baan 2024/KER/6451 CRL.MC NO. 114 OF 2024 2 BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J. Crl.M.C.No.114 of 2024 Dated this the 22\" day of January 2024 ORDER Petitioners have invoked the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C to quash all proceedings against them. 2. Petitioners are accused Nos.1 to 3 in C.P.No.119/2023 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Varkala arising out of Crime No.1870/2023 of Varkala Police Station, Thiruvananthapuram District registered for the offences under Sections 294(b), 341, 323, 324 and 308 r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Third respondent is the defacto complainant. 3. The prosecution alleges that on 03.10.2023 the accused restrained the complainant due to previous enmity and assaulted him and thereby committed the offences alleged. 4. Heard the learned Counsel for the petitioners and the learned Counsel for the respondent apart from the learned Public Prosecutor. 5. The learned Public Prosecutor pointed out that the 2\" petitioner, who is the 2 accused is a habitual offender and is involved in 11 other crimes of which 9 are of the Varkala Police Station, as Crime Nos.847/2013, 607/2019, 688/2019, 1599/2017, 1886/2014, 4439/2020, Baan 2024/KER/6451 CRL.MC NO. 114 OF 2024 3 267/2021, 280/2021, 1979/2021, 442/2021 and 1870/2023, which includes offences under Sections 307, 326, 308 and even Section 27 of the Arms Act. However, it was pointed that petitioners 1 and 3 are not involved in any other crimes of Varkala Police Station. 6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303], the Apex Court has held that in appropriate cases, the High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. This view was reiterated in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466] and Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State of Jharkhand and Another [(2014) 9 SCC 653]. 7. Though petitioners and defacto complainant are alleged to have settled the entire disputes as evident from Annexure A3, which has been verified by the learned Public Prosecutor through the Investigating Officer, | am of the view that considering the criminal antecedents of the 24 petitioner, quashing of the crime on the basis of the settlement as against him may not be conducive to public interest. The nature of offences and the other crimes stand against him in quashing the proceedings as against the 2 petitioner. As far as petitioners 1 and 3, are concerned, since there are no criminal antecedents and the matter has been settled with the defacto complainant, this Court is of the view that the proceedings against those petitioners can be quashed. 8. In the result, all proceedings against petitioners 1 and 3, who Bae Be sae 2024/KER/6451 CRL.MC NO. 114 OF 2024 4 are accused 1 and 3 in C.P.No.119/2023 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Varkala are quashed. Proceedings as against the 24 accused in the aforesaid cases shall continue. The Crl.M.C. is allowed in part.
