ANSU VARGHESE OTHER PRESENT: SR.PP.C.S.HRITHWIK THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 06.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: BSE Oa Cr1.MC.No.1839 OF 2020 (H) .3., 202 1/KERIT08 ORDER Dated this the 6th day of January 2021 Petitioners are the accused in Crime No.846/2014 registered at the Punalur Police Station for offences punishable under Sections 294(b), 323, 324, 427 r/w 34 of IPC, now pending as C.C.No.788/2014 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II]I, Punalur. The de facto complainant, at whose instance the crime was registered, is arrayed as the 3 respondent. Annexure-A2 affidavit has been filed by 3 respondent stating that the dispute, which was the reason for the incident and registration of the crime, has been resolved amicably and he has no subsisting grievance against the petitioners. 2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also, who, on instructions, submits that the petitioners have no BER aah Oa Crl1.MC.No.1839 OF 2020 (H) AL, 2021/KERI708 criminal antecedents. 3. Having considered the gravity of the offences alleged, nature of the injury caused and having perused the affidavit filed by the 3 respondent, the contents of which are submitted to be true and voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled and no public interest is involved in this matter. Moreover, in view of the settlement, possibility of the criminal proceedings ending in conviction is remote. As such, continuance of the proceedings will amount to an abuse of process of court and hence, in view of the legal position set out by the Honourable Supreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab (2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is no impediment in granting the relief sought. le aah Crl.MC.No.1839 OF 2020 (H) Be. 202 1/KERIT08 In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. The proceedings in C.C.No.788/2014 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-III, Punalur is quashed.
