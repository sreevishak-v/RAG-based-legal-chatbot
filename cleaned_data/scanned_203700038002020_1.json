CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 11.01.2021, ALONG WITH Crl.MC.3800/2020(D), THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: op Crl.MC.3800/2020 & 2021/KER/1599 Crl.MC.3806/2020 ; ORDER The petitioner in two Crl.M.Cs. viz., accused No.1 and accused No.3, 8, 4 and 6 came up to quash Annexure A9 complaint and Annexure A10 order taking cognizance for the offence under Section 420 r/w Section 34 IPC. What is alleged is based on the breach of contract and obligation arising out of it. It was contended that the defacto complainant agreed to supply rock boulders for the project of Vizhinjam International Sea Port and a letter of intent for supply of 84,00,000 MTS of rock boulders within 24 months was placed with the defacto complainant. It is alleged that defacto complainant accordingly arranged rock boulders to a considerable extent. They have also received part payment of Rs.2,75,00,000/- and Rs.1,85,00,000/-, totalling Rs.4,60,00,000/-. But subsequently, the contract was assigned to somebody else causing big loss to the complainant. The very nature of the complaint would prima facie show what is involved is a civil liability arising out of a concluded Crl.MC.3800/2020 & 2021/KER/1599 Crl.MC.3806/2020 - contract and its breach. The facts narrated and alleged would not constitute any delivery of property or detention of property either fraudulently or dishonestly under any deception or cause any damage by that means to the property or reputation of any person so as to attract the ingredient which would constitute ''cheating' as defined under Section 415 IPC. Hence it would be a futile exercise if it is proceeded further. The complaint and the order taking cognizance against the petitioners are hereby quashed. Crl.M.Cs. are allowed accordingly. Sd/- P.
