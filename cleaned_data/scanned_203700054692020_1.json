CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 08.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Berl | Crl1.MC.No.5469 OF 2020(c) 2. 202 1KER/T338 ORDER Dated this the 8th day of January 2021 Petitioners are the accused Nos. 2 and 3 in Crime No.717/2019 registered at the Binanipuram Police Station for offences punishable under Sections 406, 420 and 468 r/w 34 of IPC. The de facto complainant, at whose instance the crime was registered, is arrayed as the 2 respondent. Annexure-R2(a) affidavit has been filed by 2\" respondent. The allegation is that the petitioners along with the 1* accused had transferred the Hyundai Creta Car belonging to the de facto complainant/2 respondent by forging her signature. The de facto complainant has now filed an affidavit stating that the dispute has been resolved amicably and she has no subsisting grievance against any of the petitioners. The 1* accused is stated to be abroad and therefore, has not been arrayed as party to this Berl Crl.MC.No.5469 OF 2020(C) LiB., 202 1/KERITS38 Criminal M.C. 2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also, who, on instructions, submits that the petitioners have no criminal antecedents. 3. Having considered the gravity of the offences alleged, nature of the injury caused and having perused the affidavit filed by the 2* respondent, the contents of which are submitted to be true and voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled and no public interest is involved in this matter. Moreover, in view of the settlement, possibility of the criminal proceedings ending in conviction is remote. As such, continuance of the proceedings will amount to an abuse of process of court and hence, in view of the legal position set out by the Honourable Supreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is Bash Crl1.MC.No.5469 OF 2020(C) AL, 202 UKER/1338 no impediment in granting the relief sought. In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. Annexure-l FIR and the proceedings in Crime No.717/2019 registered at the Binanipuram Police Station, as against the petitioners is quashed.
