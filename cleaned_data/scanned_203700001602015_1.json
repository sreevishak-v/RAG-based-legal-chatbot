RESPONDENTS' ANNEXURES: NIL //TRUE COPY// P.A TO JUDGE ab Bar 2015/KER/1262 P.UBAID, J. Dated this the 12\" day of January, 2015 ORDER The petitioner herein is the sole accused in C.C. No.315/2014 of the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Thrissur. 2. On the apprehension of arrest and remand to judicial custody on surrender, the petitioner seeks a direction from this Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to the court below to release him on bail, on appropriate conditions. The offences involved are under Sections 406 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code. 3. The learned counsel submits that the petitioner has already settled all the claims with some other persons and earnest efforts are now being made to settle the whole dispute. It is also submitted that the transaction alleged in the final report is in fact a civil transaction having only civil consequences. Anyway, these aspects will have to be looked into by the learned Magistrate when the application for bail is considered. The learned Magistrate who has issued warrant of arrest for proper and legal reasons will have to consider the Dir ee 2015/KER/1262 Crl.M.C No.160 of 2015 2 petitioner's request and pass appropriate orders. I do not think that the learned Magistrate will mechanically remand him to judicial custody without hearing his grievance and without understanding the facts of the case. However, a direction can be given to the court below to dispose of the application without delay. In the result, this Criminal Miscellaneous Case is closed with direction to the court below that if application for bail is filed by the petitioner on surrender in C.C No.315/2014, it shall be judiciously considered, and appropriate orders shall be passed, on the date of surrender itself, however with notice to the other side.
