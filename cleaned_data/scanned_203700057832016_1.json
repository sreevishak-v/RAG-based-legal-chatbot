RESPONDENTS ANNEXURES NIL /TRUE COPY/ PA TO JUDGE sdr/- apes 2018/KER/493 B. KEMAL PASHA, J. Dated this the 5 day of January, 2018 ORDER Petitioners are A2 to A4 in CC No.137/2012 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Adoor, based on Annexure-A2 final report in Crime No.743/2011 of Adoor Police Station, for the offences punishable under Sections 294(b) and 324 read with Section 34 IPC. 2. On going through the contents of the final report, it is evident that the offence under Section 294(b) IPC cannot be attracted. The abusive words allegedly made use of by the petitioners have not been mentioned anywhere in the final report. Therefore, the offence under Section 294(b) IPC is liable to be quashed. 3. Regarding the offence under Section 324 IPC, there is an allegation that injuries were inflicted by beating with a firewood and also by pelting stone. According to the bale Pe 2018/KER/493 Crl.M.C.5783/2016 5. learned counsel for the petitioners, Annexures-A1 and A2 are mere counter cases to the cases registered against the de facto complainant and his associates. Those matters cannot be considered at present. With liberty to the petitioners to take up all these contentions before the trial court at appropriate stage, this Cri.M.C. is disposed of, by making it clear that the offence under Section 294(b) IPC has been quashed. As far as practicable, the court below shall grant exemption to the petitioners from personal appearance. Sd/- (B.KEMAL PASHA, JUDGE) aks/05/01 // True Copy // PS to Judge"
