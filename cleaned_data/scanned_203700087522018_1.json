JUSTICE RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN V TUESDAY ,THE O8TH DAY OF JANUARY 2019 / 18TH POUSHA, 1940 Cri.MC.No. 8752 of 2018 SC NO.530/2009 OF COURT OF ADDITIONAL DISTRICT & SESSIONS FOR THE TRIAL OF CASHES RELATING TO ATROCITIES AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE TOWARDS WOMEN AND CHILDREN AT KOZHIKODE CRIME NO.452/2008 OF MUKKOM POLICE STATION, KOZHIKODE PETITIONER/ACCUSED : KOLAKKODAN JAMALLUDHIN @ JAMAL, AGED 52 YEARS, S/O ABDHUL RAZAK, KOTTUPURATH (HOUSE), CHERUVADI, KODIYATHUR, KOZHIKODE DISTRICT. BY ADV. SRI.MOHANAN V.T.K. RESPONDENT/STATE: STATE OF KERALA, REPRESENTED BY THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR, HIGH COURT OF KERALA,ERNAKULAM-682 031. BY SMT AMBIKA DEVI SPECIAL GOVERNMENT PLEADER THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 08.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Be aeea! Cr1.MC.No. 8752 of 2018 2 201/KERI962 ORDER The petitioner herein is the 4 accused in S.C No.530 of 2009 on the file of the Additional Sessions Judge, Kozhikode, in which case, he along with others are being proceeded against for having committed offence punishable, inter alia, under Sections 366A, 372, 373 and 376(g) of the IPC. He challenges Annexure-G order passed by the learned Sessions Judge in C.M.P. No.481 of 2018, on an application filed by the 6\" accused. 2. TO appreciate the contentions advanced by the petitioner, a brief narration of the events, which led to the filing of C.M.P.No.481 of 2018, would be apposite. 3. The above case relates to multiple acts of gross sexual abuse of a minor girl by a group of persons. As per the charge laid before the Court below, the accused Nos.i and 2 are the mother and step-father respectively of the minor victim, who was aged about 13 years when the incident had taken place. In essence, the allegation against the accused as per the charge is that the 2 accused, being Be aeea! Crl.MC.No. 8752 of 2018 3 2019/KERII62 the step-father, subjected the minor child to rape on numerous occasions during the summer vacation in the year 2007, with the knowledge and consent of the 1* accused. While the minor child was residing with accused Nos. 1 and 2, the child was handed over by them to the 5\" accused, after receiving money. The child was allegedly taken by the 2 accused in a car to Wayanad and she was subjected to penetrative sexual abuse by both the accused Nos.2 and 5. Thereafter, the accused Nos. 1 and 2 are alleged to have handed over the minor child to the 4\" accused, the petitioner herein, after receiving money. The accused Nos.1, 2 and 4 took the child to Ooty in the month of June, 2008, and after confining her in a resort, subjected her to rape. It is also alleged that the petitioner subjected the minor child to rape in the home of the 1* accused at Vallathayippara. Thereafter, the accused Nos.1 and 2 are alleged to have entrusted the child to accused Nos.3, 5 to 7 and 9. They subjected her to rape in the houses belonging to the 1* accused and also in a lodge by name Arora Tower at Kozhikkode, and various other places, including the house of the 6\" and the 9\" accused, and in vehicles. 4. The court charge was framed against all the accused except Be aeea! Cr1.MC.No. 8752 of 2018 4 201/KERI962 the petitioner herein. However, for some obscure reason, the same went unnoticed. 5. While the trial proceedings were pending, a petition was filed by the 6\" accused before the learned Sessions Judge challenging the legality of the charge framed against him. He contended that distinct and separate incidents were clubbed together and as there is no commonality of purpose or continuity in action, the charge framed against him was illegal. The said petition was dismissed by the learned Sessions Judge by order dated 2.3.2016 in C.M.P. No 486 of 2016. 6. The above order was challenged by the 6\" accused before this Court and by order dated 25.07.2018 in Crl.M.C.No.1616 of 2016, his contentions were repelled and the petition was dismissed. Certain observations were made concerning the incorporation of certain details insofar as the accusation against the 6\" accused was concerned. This Court left the matter to the discretion of the trial court to consider whether the charge needs to be modified by adding those details. Even at this point of time, the inadvertent omission to frame the charge was not noticed by anyone except may be by the 6\" accused. Be aeea! Cr1.MC.No. 8752 of 2018 5 201/KERI962 7. Promptly thereafter, the 6\" accused filed C.M.P. No 494 of 2018 pointing out that though specific allegations are leveled against the petitioner, who is the 4\" accused in the charge, the learned Sessions Judge had omitted to frame a charge against him. He also raised various other contentions touching the merits of his case. 8. The learned Sessions Judge by order dated 5.12.2018 allowed the petition holding that due to an inadvertent error, charge was omitted to be framed against the petitioner. In tune with the observation made by this Court with regard to incorporation of certain details concerning the 6\" accused, the learned Sessions Judge proceeded to initiate steps to cure the error. 9. The above order is challenged by the petitioner through this petition filed under Section 482 of the CrP.C. 10. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner contended that the learned Sessions Judge had erred in acting upon a petition filed by a co-accused to proceed to frame a charge against the petitioner. According to the learned counsel, the only alternative before the learned Sessions Judge was to discharge the petitioner. Be aeea! Cr1.MC.No. 8752 of 2018 6 201/KERI962 11. The learned Special Public Prosecutor contended that there is no merit in the submissions advanced. She would refer to the final report and it is contended that serious allegations are leveled against the petitioner herein by the victim and it was due to an inadvertent error that the Court below had omitted to frame a charge against him. It is submitted that the trial has not commenced till date and the court is armed with powers to correct any error in stating the offence or the particulars required to be stated in the charge. The omission to state the offence or those particulars cannot be regarded at any stage of the case as material, more so when the accused has no case that any failure of justice has occasioned. 12. I have considered the submissions advanced and have perused the final report. 13. It appears that the investigation in the instant case was completed and final report was initially laid against accused Nos.1, 2, 3,6, 7,8 &9 on 8.1.2019. When the same was laid, the investigation against the petitioner and two others was being proceeded with. Later, a final report was laid before the jurisdictional Court as against the Besse fal Paley bese Cr1.MC.No. 8752 of 2018 7 201/KERI962 petitioner. The first report was returned with a direction to submit it along with the final report against the 4\" accused. As such, final report against accused Nos. 1 to 9, except the 5 accused was submitted before court on 19.2.2009. The final report against the 5 accused was thereafter submitted before the learned Magistrate on 6.4.2009. The accused were committed to the Court of Session by a common committal order dated 14.8.2009. However, when charge was framed on 15.10.2009, though in the cause title the name of the petitioner is also mentioned, the court below omitted to state the particulars as to time, place and person insofar as the petitioner is concerned. This omission was noted only when the 6 accused brought this fact to the notice of the trial court. 14. The object of framing a charge is to enable the accused to have a clear idea of what he is being tried and for the essential facts that he has to meet. The charge must contain the particulars of date, time, place and person against whom the offence was committed as are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged. In the instant case, it is evident that it was due to an inadvertent error that the charge was omitted to be framed Pastel Be aeea! Cr1.MC.No. 8752 of 2018 8 201/KERI962 against the petitioner It is not an error which is not susceptible to correction. Section 216 of the Code gives ample power to the Courts to alter or amend the charge at any time before the Judgment is pronounced. Even during trial, if the trial court on a broad probabilities of the case based upon total effect of the evidence and documents produced is satisfied that any addition or alteration of the charge is necessary, it is free to do so and there cannot be any legal bar to appropriately act as the exigencies of the case warrant or necessitate. In the instant case, the trial has not even commenced. 15. In that view of the matter, I find no illegality or irregularity in the order passed by the learned Sessions Judge. However, as the specific contention of the petitioner is that he was not granted an opportunity to advance his submissions, the learned Sessions Judge shall afford the petitioner a pre-charge hearing as provided under Chapter XVIII of the CrP.C. so that any question of prejudice being caused can be averted. 16. The petitioner shall appear before the court below on 10.01.2019 and the court shall proceed with the trial in accordance oan Cr1.MC.No. 8752 of 2018 9 201/KERI962 with law. The learned Sessions Judge shall also endeavor to expedite the trial proceedings and take the matter to its logical conclusion as more than a decade has elapsed after registration of the crime. This petition will stand disposed of with the above directions. SD/- RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN V., JUDGE IAP //TRUE COPY// P.A.
