CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 18.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: 2024/KER/6397 CRL.MC NO. 26 OF 2024 2 BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J. Dated this the 18\" day of January, 2024 ORDER Petitioners have invoked the jurisdiction under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 to quash all proceedings against them. 2. Petitioners are accused Nos. 1 to 3 in C.C. No.234 of 2020 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrates Court, Payyannur arising out of Crime No.456 of 2019 of Pariyaram Police Station, Kannur, registered for the offences under Sections 341, 323, 324 and 294(b) of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. 2* respondent is the defacto complainant. 3. According to the prosecution, the accused had on 02-10-2019, scolded the defacto complainant using abusive language and thereby committed the offences alleged. 4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned counsel for the respondents, apart from the 2024/KER/6397 CRL.MC NO. 26 OF 2024 3 learned Public Prosecutor. 5. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the matter has been settled and hence the proceedings against the petitioners ought to be quashed. It was also submitted that, considering the nature of offences alleged, no purpose would be served by continuing the proceedings. 6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and Another [((2012) 10 SCC 303], the Apex Court has held that in appropriate cases, the High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. This view was reiterated in Narinder Singh and Others v. State of Punjab and Another [(2014) 6 SCC 466] and Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State of Jharkhand and Another [(2014) 9 SCC 653]. 7. Ihave perused Annexure-A-2 affidavit filed by the 24 respondent. The learned Public Prosecutor has submitted that upon verification, it is understood that the affidavit is genuine, and the defacto complainant stands by the contents thereof. I am satisfied that the matter has been settled and no public interest is involved in this case. Bell Spe eke BIS aao 2024/KER/6397 CRL.MC NO. 26 OF 2024 4 There is no impediment for granting the prayer for quashing. The continuance of the proceedings will only be an exercise in futility. 8. Accordingly, all proceedings against the petitioners in C.C. No.234 of 2020 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrates Court, Payyannur arising out of Crime No.456 of 2019 of Pariyaram Police Station, Kannur are quashed. This Crl.M.C is allowed as above.
