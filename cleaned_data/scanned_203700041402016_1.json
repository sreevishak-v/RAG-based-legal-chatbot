ANNEXURE A2 TRUE COPY OF THE AFFIDAVIT SWORN IN BY RESPONDENT NO.1 RESPONDENT(S) ANNEXURES: NIL ITRUE COPY/ P.A.TO JUDGE sts 2016/KER/33660 RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN, V., J. Dated this the 1% day of August, 2016 ORDER 1.The petitioners herein are the accused Nos. 1 and 2 in C.C.No.3003 of 2013 of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class-I, Hosdurg. They are charged with for having committed offence punishable under Section 506(i) read with section 34 of the IPC. The 1* respondent is the victim. 2.The instant petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure banking on the ratio of the Judgment rendered by the Apex Court in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab ( 2012 (4) KLT 108) and a series of other cases which include Narinder Singh and others v. State of Punjab and Another [2014) 6 SCC 466] and Bn apa 2016/KER/33660 Cri.M.C. No.4140 of 2016 -2- Yogendra Yadav _ and others V_ State of Jharkhand (2014 (9) SCC 653 ) with a prayer to quash the above proceeding. 3.The sole ground is that the Apex Court in the above judgments have delineated the circumstances and the cases in which inherent powers under Section 482 can be invoked de hors section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for recognizing out of court settlement for the purpose of quashing criminal proceedings. It is prayed that powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure be invoked to quash the criminal proceedings . 4.It is submitted that the parties have reached an out of court settlement and there is no acrimony between them at present. All the disputes have been amicably resolved and they desire to live in peace and harmony. The 1* respondent has sworn to an affidavit wherein he asserts Bn apa 2016/KER/33660 Cri.M.C. No.4140 of 2016 -3- that he has no objection in terminating the proceedings. 5.The prosecution allegation is that on 10.8.2013 at about 4.00 p.m., the petitioners had criminally intimidated the 1** respondent and thus committed the offence. 6.The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submits that no other cases are reported against the petitioners. 7.1 have given my anxious consideration to the submissions made across the bar and I have also gone through the materials on record. 8.The victim has sworn to an affidavit wherein it is asserted that he has no objection in allowing the petition and in quashing the proceedings as all the disputed between the parties have been resolved and the parties are living in peace and harmony. The pendency of the Criminal proceeding will act as a hindrance to the peace and harmony which prevail between the parties. Bn apa 2016/KER/33660 Cri.M.C. No.4140 of 2016 -4- 9.It appears to me that the offence is entirely personal in nature and do not affect public peace or tranquility. It is also felt that quashing of proceedings on account of compromise would bring about peace. In a case such as the instant one, even if the prosecution is allowed to continue, it would not serve any purpose as the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak. It can only result in putting the de facto complainant and the accused to unwanted oppression and prejudice. Settlement will augur well for the interest of the community and will enable the parties to live in peace and harmony. 10.1 am of the view that this Court is well justified in quashing the impugned proceedings as the instant case falls within the matrix of guidelines issued by the Apex Court in Gian Singh (Supra) and the other cases referred to above. ne a poe ape 2016/KER/33660 Cri.M.C. No.4140 of 2016 -5- In the result, this petition is allowed. All further proceedings against the petitioners, who are the accused Nos.1 and 2 in C.C.No.3003 of 2013 of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class-I, Hosdurg, shall stand quashed.
