ANNEXURE B THE AFFIDAVIT SWORN IN BY THE 2ND RESPONDENT HEREIN/DEFACTO COMPLAINANT DT. 18/4/2016 RESPONDENT (S)' ANNEXURES NIL. / TRUE COPY / P.S. TO JUDGE PI Peas RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.Y, J. ELS Cri.M.C.No. 2636 of 2016 Dated this the 01* day of August, 2016 ORDER 1.The petitioners are the accused Nos. 1 and 2 in C.C.No.194 of 2000 on the files of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class, Kodungallur. They are charged for having committed offence punishable under Sections 420, 427 and Section 34 of the IPC. The respondent No. 2 is the de facto complainant, who has lodged the complaint for and on behalf of the 3 respondent. 2.The instant petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure banking on the ratio of the Judgment rendered by the Apex Court in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab ( 2012 (4) KLT 108) and a series of other cases which include Narinder Singh and others v. State of Punjab and Another (2014) 6 SCC 466) and Yogendra Yadav and others V_ State _ of Jharkhand (2014 (9) SCC 653 ) with a prayer to quash the above proceeding. 3.The sole ground is that the Apex Court in the above Pee 2016/KER/33656 Crl.M.C.No. 2636 of 2016 ; judgments have delineated the circumstances and the cases in which inherent powers under Section 482 can be invoked de hors section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for recognizing out of court settlement for the purpose of quashing criminal proceedings. It is prayed that powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure be invoked to quash the criminal proceedings. 4. The prosecution allegation is that the first accused had availed a loan of Rs.25,000/- from the Pappinivattom Service Co-operative Bank of which the 2 respondent is the Secretary. The property having an extent of 19.5 cents was mortgaged. It is alleged that later the accused had extracted earth from the mortgaged property and thus caused loss to the _ defacto complainant. 5.The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submits that no other cases are reported against the petitioners. 6.1 have given my anxious consideration to the Pee 2016/KER/33656 Crl.M.C.No. 2636 of 2016 3 submissions made across the bar and I have also gone through the materials on record. 7.The 2 respondent has sworn to an affidavit wherein it is asserted that he has no objection in allowing the petition and in quashing the proceedings as all the disputed between the parties have been resolved. All financial transactions between the 3% respondent and the petitioners herein have been settled. 8.It appears to me that the offence is entirely personal in nature and do not affect public peace or tranquility. It is also felt that quashing of proceedings on account of compromise would bring about peace. In a case such as the instant one, even if the prosecution is allowed to continue, it would not serve any purpose as the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak. It can only result in putting the de facto complainant and the accused to unwanted oppression and _ prejudice. Settlement will augur well for the interest of the community and will enable the parties to live in peace Dae a pide 2016/KER/33656 Crl.M.C.No. 2636 of 2016 4 and harmony. 9.1 am of the view that this Court is well justified in quashing the impugned proceedings as the instant case falls within the matrix of guidelines issued by the Apex Court in Gian Singh (Supra) and the other cases referred to above. In the result, this petition is allowed. All further proceedings against the petitioners in C.C.No.194 of 2000 on the files of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class, Kodungallur, shall stand quashed. Sd/-RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.YV, Judge Isn"
