ORDER The petitioners herein are three Juveniles in Conflict with Law' facing prosecution with Juvenile Justice Board, Ernakulam in C.C No.1/2015, involving the offences under Section 457, 380 IPC. The first informant on whose complaint the police registered the crime is one Biju Joseph. The petitioners seek orders under Section 482 Cr.P.C quashing the prosecution against them before the Juvenile Justice Board on the ground that they have come to terms amicably with the complainant out of court, and the complainant Biju Joseph has no grievance or complaint now. The complainant Biju Joseph is the second respondent herein. He has filed affidavit to the effect that the has settled the dispute with the petitioners on the request of their parents, and that the whole dispute stands resolved forever. He has no grievance or complaint now. I am well satisfied that the parties have come to terms amicably, and that orders quashing the prosecution is required in the interest of the juveniles facing prosecution. I find that continuance of proceeding before the Juvenile Justice Board in the above situation will not pS sa] ae ops 2015/KER/1523 Cri. M.C No. 208 of 2015 2 serve any purpose, and if trial proceeds it may cause harm and hardship to the juveniles. In the result, this petition is allowed. The prosecution against the petitioners herein before the Juvenile Justice Board, Ernakulam in C.C No.1/2015 will stand quashed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. Accordingly, the petitioners will stand released from such proceeding, and the bail bond, if any, executed their guardians/parents will stand discharged. P.UBAID, JUDGE sab"
