Crl.M.C.No.6328 of 2015 Dated this the 3\" day of August, 2016 ORDER Petitioners are accused Nos.1 and 2 in Crime No.550 of 2014 of Badiyadukka Police Station for offence punishable under section 366 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code. 2. The allegation of the prosecution is that on 24.11.2014 at about 10 a.m. the accused came in a swift car driven by the second petitioner and when it reached the check post, the first petitioner, who was sitting on the rear side of the car, opened the door and asked the second respondent, who was standing on the road side, to enter the car. She was then forcefully taken by hand and pulled into the car by the first petitioner. She was allegedly abducted with the intention of making sex. In the meanwhile, police is stated to have intervened and a complaint was taken from her. Crime was registered and after investigation, final report was laid and the matter is now pending as C.C.No.442 of 2015. 3. The first petitioner herein contended that she was known to him and that, they were voluntarily travelling in a vehicle. It was further contended that certain other persons 2 2016/KER/33896 Crl.M.C.6328/15 2 intervened in the issue and informed the police. To substantiate it, first petitioner herein had produced certain photographs of the second respondent individually as well as jointly with her in a vehicle. 4. The second respondent has now filed an affidavit dated 25.06.2016 swearing that the criminal proceedings were initiated on the basis of a complaint laid by her. The matter is now settled between the parties and due to the intervention of her relatives and other mediators, she has stated that she does not intend to proceed against the petitioners. Evidently, the affidavit has been filed by her after having perused the complaint and the photographs, which have also been produced along with the Crl.M.C. 5. In the light of the above, the second respondent had consciously and knowingly stated that she has no grievance against the petitioners, thereby affecting the substratum of the prosecution case. Learned counsel for the second respondent also endorsed the averments in the affidavit and submitted that in the interest of both sides, the case should be given a decent burial. In the light of the above submissions and the affidavit filed, I feel that the matter can be given a quietus. Biel ape 2016/KER/33896 Crl.M.C.6328/15 3 In the result, Crl.M.C is allowed. Entire proceedings arising from Crime No.550 of 2014 of Badiyadukka Police Station stand quashed. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS Judge Sbna/3/8/16 True Copy / PA to Judge"
