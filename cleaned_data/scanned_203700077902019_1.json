CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 26-11-2020, THE COURT ON 06-01-2021 PASSED THE FOLLOWING: sone Crl.M.C.7790/2019 ; 202 UKER885 ORDER The sole accused in V.C.No.3 of 2019 of Vigilance and Anti- Corruption Bureau, Thiruvananthapuram unit, for offences punishable under section 7(a) of Prevention of Corruption Act and sections 294(b), 323 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code is the petitioner herein. 2. The case of the prosecution is that, petitioner herein was the Sub Inspector of Police, Chirayinkeezhu Police Station on 26.02.2019. On that day, second respondent who was the Secretary of Mamam Chenkulath Mahadeva Temple, Attingal had authorized one Gopakumar to collect one load of river sand for laying in the temple premises, as a part of decorating the temple in connection with the festival. While the said Gopakumar was returning in his lorry to the temple in the morning after collecting river sand, he was intercepted by the petitioner herein alleging that, river sand was being transported without requisite permission or pass. The vehicle was taken to the police station and the driver was detained there. On getting information, second respondent intervened and met the Sub Inspector. He demanded a bribe of Rs.25,000/- for releasing the vehicle. On payment of money, Gopakumar was released. He had also offered to permit the second respondent to take more river sand without any interruption, if the bribe was given. 3. Alleging that the accused had committed the offences sone Crl.M.C.7790/2019 ; 202 UKER885 punishable under the PC Act by demanding and receiving bribe, complaint was submitted to the ADGP Vigilance. Pursuant to it, crime was registered and the investigation is progressing. Petitioner has approached this Court to quash the proceedings, contending that, he has been falsely implicated due to personal enmity and that, he has neither demanded bribe nor received it. A. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and learned Special Government Pleader. Examined the case diary. 5. The alleged incident was on 26.02.2019. The version of the petitioner seems to be that, on 26.02.2016 in the morning, petitioner had intercepted the vehicle which was illicitly carrying river sand. The vehicle was taken to the police station. In the meanwhile, it was informed by the temple authorities that river sand was collected in connection with the festival activities and retention of the vehicle by the accused was likely to cause discord among the devotees. Apprehending that a communal angle was likely to be given, Sub Inspector released the vehicle forthwith. He has not demanded any bribe nor received it, it was claimed. 6. Annexure-I is the copy of the complaint submitted by the second respondent to the rural police Chief. The complaint is dated 28.02.2019. In the above complaint, he has specifically stated that, on getting information that Gopakumar was detained, he went to the police station and met the Sub Inspector. He demanded Rs.25,000/- for releasing the vehicle and for permitting them to take more river sand. Plz Crl.M.C.7790/2019 , 202 UKER885 Accordingly, the second respondent directly gave Rs.25,000/- to the Sub Inspector. A request in writing for permitting him to take more river sand was obtained by the Sub Inspector of Police. 7. Pursuant to the complaint, an enquiry was conducted by the DySP, Attingal. The report of the DySP dated 02.03.2019 submitted to the District Police Chief, Thiruvananthapuram rural was produced along with the Crl.M.C. In that, DySP had recorded that the second respondent herein had reiterated the version in the complaint that, Rs.25,000/- was directly paid by him to the Sub Inspector of Police. However, the version of Gopakumar, was that, after interception of the vehicle, he was informed by the Sub Inspector that the vehicle will be released only on payment of Rs.25,000/- to the Sub Inspector. This was conveyed to the second respondent who came to the police station, got the driver released on bail and while they were waiting outside the police station, Gopakumar got a call from an anonymous number. The person who called him informed him that the call was made as directed by the Sub Inspector. Gopakumar was directed to come to the railway station if the money payable to the Sub Inspector was ready. After collecting money from the second respondent, Gopakumar went to the railway station. One unidentifiable person came in a car, introduced himself as the person send by the Sub Inspector and collected money from him. He further stated that, he could not recollect the number of the vehicle in which that person came. These versions of the second respondent and Gopakumar are seen reiterated by Plz Crl.M.C.7790/2019 ; 202 UKER885 them in their $.161 Cr.P.C statement given to the police. Evidently, the versions of second respondent and Gopakumar as to how the money was given are diametrically opposite. According to the second respondent, it was directly paid by him to the Sub Inspector, whereas according to the Gopakumar, he collected the money from the second respondent, went to the railway station and handed it over to the unknown person. 8. It is seen that, $.164 Cr.P.C statement of the said Gopakumar and second respondent were recorded before the learned Magistrate. At the time of the statement before the Magistrate, second respondent had stated that, he had met the Sub Inspector of Police on the relevant day. On informing him that the river sand was taken for the purpose of the temple, Gopakumar was released by him. Thereafter, one person made a telephone call to Gopakumar, represented himself as the person authorized by the Sub Inspector and demanded money. He has further stated that, Gopakumar entrusted the money to that person. This is contrary to his earlier $.161 Cr.P.C statement given in the complaint. 9, However, Gopakumar, at the time of his statement under S.164 Cr.P.C recorded on 08.05.2019 had stated that, the vehicle which was intercepted by the Sub Inspector was released after the SI was informed that it was meant for the temple. He asserted that, neither the Sub Inspector had demanded the money nor has he paid any amount to the Sub Inspector or to any other person on his behalf. Thus he completely retracted from the statement given under $.161 CrP.C. Hence, no sone Crl.M.C.7790/2019 ; 202 UKER885 credence can be given to the allegation of Gopakumar against the petitioner. Thus both the crucial witnesses have given mutually destructive oral statements. 10. The further version of complainant was that, on that day, for collecting the river sand, he had given Rs.4500/- as value of the river sand and Rs.800/- towards the loading charges. A total sum of Rs.5,300/- was paid by Gopakumar to the persons who had sold the river sand. Prosecution is relying on the expenditure statement of temple to establish that Rs.25,000/- was paid to the petitioner as bribe. The above accounts include an entry of Rs.25,000/- paid to police for releasing the vehicle. However, expenditure statement of the temple on 26.02.2019 seized by the police indicates that a sum of Rs.45,000/- was paid towards the value of river sand and Rs.8,000/- towards the loading expenses and the vehicle expenses at Rs.17,000/-. No explanation is given by Gopakumar or 2 respondent as to how the huge discrepancy arose. Evidently, it seems to be a highly inflated amount and hence the entries seems to be doubtful. 11. The investigating agency has further alleged that the second accused was the person who had called Gopakumar on his mobile, while he was in the police station. According to it, second accused had collected the money from Gopakumar at the Railway station. Investigating agency found that the telephones of second accused and that of Gopakumar were within the Chirayankeezhu tower station during that day. It was also found that second accused was close to Sub coe Crl.M.C.7790/2019 , 202 1/KER/885 Inspector and both had called each other on the relevant day on several occasions. However, when second accused was shown to Gopakumar, he did not identify him and stated that he was not the person who had received the money. The car in which money was handed over has also not been identified. 12. In the light of the specific version of the second respondent and the clear statement tendered by Gopakumar in his $.164 Cr.P.C statement, I feel that, evidence gathered by the prosecution has become extremely shaky. In the absence of convincing evidence regarding the demand for money and payment of it, prosecution may not be able to sustain the case in a court of law, notwithstanding the detailed and meticulous investigation done by the agency till now. Mere suspicion against the petitioner will not be sufficient to prosecute him. Having considered it, I feel that, it may not be safe to direct the accused to face the trial for the above offences in the light of this highly inconsistent evidence collected by the investigating officer touching the crucial aspects. It is true that, there are some materials to suspect the conduct of the petitioner on other aspects than the demand and payment of money. 13. Having considered the entire facts, I am inclined to quash the proceedings considering the quality of materials collected by the prosecution. However, Department will be free to initiate appropriate departmental action, if any, for releasing the vehicle without registering a Biase pir ae Bae Crl.M.C.7790/2019 202 1/KER/885 g crime. In the result, Crl.M.C is allowed. All further proceedings in VC.No.3 of 2019 of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau, Thiruvananthapuram unit against the petitioner will stand quashed.
