Crl.M.C.No.4681 of 2017 Dated this the 6\" day of December, 2017 ORDER Petitioner herein, aggrieved by the dismissal of her application under section 302 Cr.P.C has approached this Court. Petitioner herein is the de facto complainant in C.C.No.1930 of 2015 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kadakkal (Temporary). It appears that, there was a counter case as C.C.No.9 of 2014, in which, CW1 was the de facto complainant. In that case, Annexure-Al application under section 302Cr.P.C was laid on a premise that since CW1 in C.C.No.9 of 2014 was the accused in C.C.No.1930 of 2015 and if it is conducted by the same Assistant Public Prosecutor, there is likelihood of prejudice. 2. Court below, after hearing the petitioner herein and the learned Assistant Public Prosecutor dismissed the application after perusing the files. It was found by the learned magistrate that, Assistant Public Prosecutor of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Punalur was to conduct the prosecution in C.C.No.9 of 2014. Other connected case was conducted by another Public Prosecutor. Court below rightly concluded that, since the case and counter case are handed by different Public Prosecutors, no prejudice will be caused to the victim in the case and there is no likelihood of Bee E] ry 2017/KER/49283 Cril.M.C.4681/17 2 miscarriage of justice. Evidently, the apprehension of the petitioner herein stand allayed by the very fact that two separate Assistant Public Prosecutors are conducting the cases. Having considered this, I find no ground for challenge in the case. Crl.M.C fails and is dismissed. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS Judge Sbna/6/12/17 True Copy / P A to Judge"
