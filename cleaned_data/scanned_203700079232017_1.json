CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 07.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Buel 2 a Bisset: CRL.MC:7923/18 3 2019/KERIA9S ORDER This petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 2. The petitioners herein are the accused Nos.1 and 2 in C.C No.1758 of 2015 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class-II, Kochi involving offences punishable under Sections 498A and 423 r/w. Section 34 of the IPC. The de facto complainant, who is arrayed as the 1* respondent, is the wife of the 1* petitioner herein. The 2\" petitioner is the mother of the 1* petitioner. 3. The instant petition is filed with a prayer to quash the proceedings on the ground of settlement of all disputes. The 1* respondent has filed an affidavit stating that she does not wish to continue with the prosecution proceedings against the petitioners. 4. The learned Public Prosecutor has obtained instructions. He submitted that the statement of the 1 respondent has been recorded and the State has no objection in terminating the proceedings as it involves no public interest. 5. I have considered the submissions advanced. Buel Bisse CRL.MC:7923/18 4 201 /KERMOS 6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303] and in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466], the Apex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. Further in Jitendra Raghuvanshi & Others v. Babita Raghuvanshi & Another [(2013) 4 SCC 58], it was observed that it is the duty of the courts to encourage genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes. If the parties ponder over their faults and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual agreement instead of fighting it out in a court of law, the courts should not hesitate to exercise its powers under Section 482 of the Code. Permitting such proceedings to continue would be nothing, but an abuse of process of court. The interest of justice also require that the proceedings be quashed. Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I am of the considered view that this Court will be well justified in invoking its extraordinary powers under Section 482 of the Code to quash the proceedings. In the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-A final report and all proceedings pursuant thereto against the petitioners Buel CRL.MC:7923/18 5 2019/KERIA9S now pending as C.C No.1758 of 2015 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class-II, Kochi are quashed.
