RESPONDENT'S EXHIBITS: NIL //TRUE COPY// P.A. TO JUDGE STK eset 2018/KER/244 B. SUDHEENDRA KUMAR, J. Crl.M.C. No.4680 of 2016 Dated this the 4\" day of January, 2018 ORDER The petitioners are accused Nos.1 and 2 in C.C.No.122/2016 on the files of the court below. The above case arose out of a private complaint filed by the second respondent herein before the court below alleging the offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (in short, 'the N.I.Act'). 2. The petitioners have filed this Crl.M.C., praying for quashing Annexure-Al complaint and _ further proceedings against the petitioner in the above said case. 3. Heard. 4, The learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted that the petitioners are not the present President and Secretary of V.B. Garden Flat Owners Association and hence, the complaint filed against the petitioners is not maintainable. 5. It is clearly stated in Annexure-Al complaint 2018/KER/244 Cri.M.C. No.4680 of 2016 i 2t that the liability, which resulted in issuing the cheque in question, arose out of the supply of the drinking water to the flat, namely, 'M/s.V.B.Garden'. The water was supplied as per the request of V.B.Garden Flat Owners Association. 6. The provision contained in Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act clearly stipulates that when a company commits an offence, then certain categories of persons in-charge as well as the company would be deemed to be liable for the offence under Section 138 of the N.I.Act. Thus, the statutory intendment is absolutely plain. As is perceptible, the provision makes the functionaries and companies to be liable and that is by deeming fiction. Therefore, if the company commits an offence, the company has to be made as an accused. In explanation to Section 141 of the N.I. Act, company means any body corporate and includes a firm or other association of individuals. Therefore, without the association being made as an accused, the complaint 2018/KER/244 Cri.M.C. No.4680 of 2016 i3G- cannot be maintainable. 7. The 1* and the 2 accused are the present President and the Secretary of V.B.Garden Flat Owners Association, who represent the association. Therefore, the petitioners are not arraigned as accused in their personal capacity. It is also contended in the complaint that the 3% and the 4\" accused were the former President and Secretary of V.B.Garden Flat Owners Association, who executed and issued the cheque in question as they were then in-charge and responsible for the affairs of the Association. It is further alleged that the 1% and the 2\" accused are presently in-charge and responsible for the day-to-day affairs of the Association. It is stated that the 3 and the 4\" accused, in their capacity as the then President and Secretary of the Association, issued the cheque in question. In view of the above averments, | am of the view that the complaint filed is perfectly maintainable. However, whether the petitioners are the present President and the Secretary of the Association or 2018/KER/244 Cri.M.C. No.4680 of 2016 -: 4;- not, can be decided only after taking evidence. Suffice it to say that, having gone through the averments in Annexure-Al complaint, | am_ satisfied that Ext.Al complaint prima facie discloses the ingredients to constitute the offence under Section 138 of the N.|.Act. In the said circumstances, | am not inclined to quash Annexure-Al complaint and further proceedings against the petitioners as sought for. In the result, this Crl.M.C. stands dismissed. However, the petitioners shall be granted exemption from personal appearance before the court below on all posting dates except when their presence is necessary for the progress of the case, if the petitioners file application in this regard before the court below, after their appearance in person before the court, within 30 days from today.
