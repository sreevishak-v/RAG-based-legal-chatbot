Dated this the 3\" day of August, 2016 ORDER The petitioner herein challenges the order of the court below in CMP No.2404/2016 in MC (DV) No.167/2011. The petitioner herein had filed the MC seeking reliefs in the year 2011. Thereafter, it appears that, there was a direction for a time bound disposal of that case. The court was proceeding with the case to be disposed of on or before 14.06.2016, as per the order in MC No.793/2015 dated 09.02.2015 of the Hon'ble High Court. At that time, the petitioner herein filed the amendment application. Hence, the learned Magistrate addressed the High Court to seek extension of time. Even the court below has noted that, several petitions were filed by the petitioner one after another and hence court could not dispose of the case within the time stipulated. The court below holding that the application was highly belated, allowed the application subject to payment of cost of 71,000/- to be paid within 3 days. This is under challenge in this petition. 2. Heard the petitioner in person at length and the learned Public Prosecutor. 3. |The impugned order speaks by itself. Even though the 2016/KER/33889 Crl. M. C. No. 4898 of 2016 2 case was initiated by the party in person in the year 2011, it could not be brought to the logical conclusion, due to various reasons. Even the court below has taken note of the fact that the petitions were being filed one after another, considerably delaying the entire procedure. The petitioner herein cannot now lament of delay after being a party for such delay. On enquiry from the party-in-person itself, it is revealed that, at least six proceedings are pending arising out of matrimonial discord in various courts including two before this Court. 4. The only ground on which the impugned order is challenged is that, she is without any means, she has no employment and that she has no other source of income. Prima facie, the fact that she herself has been contesting the proceedings in various courts and she herself claims to be a B.Sc B.Ed graduate, belies her contention. 5. Having regard to the entire facts and in the interest of justice, | am inclined to take a lenient view and to delete the portion imposing cost only to ensure that the matter is not further delayed under the guise of pendency of this Crl.M.C. 6. Hence, Crl.M.C. is disposed of confirming the impugned Pe a A eee 2016/KER/33889 Cri. M. C. No. 4898 of 2016 3 order however, by directing that the cost as ordered by the court though legally correct, need not be insisted upon. It is made clear that, the petitioner herein shall carry out the amendment in the presence of the Junior Superintendent of that Court within 5 days from today. If this order is not complied with, within 5 days from today, the benefit of amendment will not be available to the petitioner herein. Issue copy forthwith to the petitioner. She shall produce it before the court below within the above 5 days. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE. Pn"
