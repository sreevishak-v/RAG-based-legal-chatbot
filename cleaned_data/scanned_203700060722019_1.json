CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 05- 12-2019, THE COURT ON 06-01-2020 PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Giga 2020/KER/81 Cr1.M.C.No.6072/2019 2 R.NARAYANA PISHARADI, J 2K 2K OK 2K 2K 2K 2K OK 2K OK 2K 2K OK 2K OK 2K 2k OK ok 2K OK 2K Ok Crl.M.C.No.6072 of 2019 Dated this the 6\" day of January, 2020 ORDER The petitioners are the first and the second accused in the case registered as O.R.No.3/2019 of the Mankulam Forest Range Office. 2. The offences alleged against the petitioners are under Sections 27(1)(a), 27(1)(e)(i) and 27(1)(e)(iv) of the Kerala Forest Act, 1961. 3. The prosecution case is as follows: On 26.06.2019, when the Section Forest Officer conducted inspection of the Kallar Section of the reserve forest with forest officials, he found the bamboo and the undergrowth there being cut and destroyed from an area of half acres of forest. Then they heard sound from the nearby place and when they reached there, they saw accused 3 2020/KER/81 Cr1.M.C.No.6072/2019 3 to 7 cutting and destroying the bamboo and the undergrowth there. The statements of the aforesaid persons revealed that they were employed by the first and the second accused to do the work. 4. This petition is filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C for quashing the proceedings against the petitioners in the case registered as O.R.No.3/2019 in relation to the aforesaid incident. 5. Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned Public Prosecutor. 6. The plea of the petitioners is as follows: The petitioners are in absolute possession of 2 Acres and 47 cents of land in Mankulam Village. The aforesaid land has been in their absolute possession since the year 1995. They had cultivated the aforesaid land with black pepper, arecanut, coconut trees, mango trees etc. There are also two houses situated in the aforesaid land. The petitioners, along with some other persons, had filed W.P.(C) No.14674/2007 before this Court claiming benefit of the Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 2005 and the Kerala Stay of Eviction Proceedings Act, 2005 seeking a 2020/KER/81 Cr1.M.C.No.6072/2019 1 declaration that they are eligible and entitled to get certificates of title to the property mentioned above. The aforesaid writ petition was disposed of by this Court as per Annexure-3 judgment by directing the petitioners to raise their claims before the concerned authority. It was also ordered that status quo as on the date of judgment shall continue. The petitioners have filed application before the Forest Settlement Officer, Mankulam and the Revenue Divisional Officer, Devikulam for getting certificates of title in respect of their land. When the revenue authorities came to the property of the petitioners, the officials of Mankulam Forest Range did not permit them to survey the said property. The Revenue Divisional Officer had informed the petitioners to clear the bushes and shrubs for conducting survey. The petitioners engaged their workers for clearing the grass, bushes and shrubs. The workers so engaged by the petitioners are implicated in the case registered by the forest officials. The petitioners have not committed any offence alleged against them. 7. Learned counsel for the petitioners has contended that Annexure-3 judgment of this Court would show that the 2020/KER/81 Cr1.M.C.No.6072/2019 5 petitioners are in possession of the land in question and that it is not a forest area. Learned counsel for the petitioners would also invite the attention of this Court to the direction made by this Court in Annexure-3 judgment that status quo shall continue in relation to the land. 8. It is true that there is a direction in Annexure-3 judgment that the petitioners can approach the concerned authority raising their claim and then the concerned authority shall adjudicate the claim and pass orders and until such time, status quo as on the date of the judgment will continue. However, it is to be noted that, the direction in Annexure-3 judgment that status quo will continue, is applicable to the petitioners also. 9. It is admitted in the petition that the petitioners had employed accused 3 to 7 in the case to clear the grass, shrubs and bushes in the disputed land. However, there is a specific recital in the spot mahazar prepared by the Section Forest Officer that the workers of the petitioners had cut the bamboo in the disputed land. Learned counsel for the petitioners would submit 2020/KER/81 Cr1.M.C.No.6072/2019 , that they have not cut any bamboo from the land in question. However, in a petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C, this Court cannot decide such disputed facts. 10. The offences alleged against the petitioners are under Sections 27(1) (a), 27(1)(e)(i) and 27(1)(e)(iv) of the Kerala Forest Act. Section 27(1) (a) of the Act prescribes the punishment for committing any act prohibited by Section 7 of the Act. Section 7 of the Act provides that, during the interval between the publication of the notification under Section 4 and the date fixed by the notification under Section 19, no right shall be acquired in or over the land included in such notification under Section 4 except under a grant or contract in writing made or entered into by, or on behalf of, the Government, or by, or on behalf of, some person in whom such right, or power to create the same was vested when the notification under Section 4 was published, or by succession from such person; and no clearings shall be made on such land, nor shall any person cut, collect, or remove any forest produce not shall set fire to such land or kindle or leave burning any fire in such manner as to endanger 2020/KER/81 Cr1.M.C.No.6072/2019 ; the same. In the instant case, admittedly, there is a notification issued by the government under Section 4 of the Act on 16.05.2007 in respect of the land in dispute proposing to constitute it as reserve forest. 11. Section 27(1)(e)(i) of the Act presrbies the punishment for a person, who, in a Reserved Forest or in a land proposed to be constituted a Reserved Forest cultivates or clears or breaks up any land for cultivation or for any other purpose or puts up any shed or other structures or plant trees. Section 27(1)(e)(iv) of the Act presrbies the punishment for a person, who trespasses upon such land. 12. It is evident from the aforesaid provisions that commission of any prohibited act even in a land proposed to be declared as a reserved forest would attract the offences mentioned above. 13. Prima facie, there are materials to show that the petitioners had cut and destroyed the bamboo as well as the undergrowth from the disputed land. Whether the disputed land is forest area declared as a reserve forest or proposed to be 2020/KER/81 Cr1.M.C.No.6072/2019 ; declared as a reserved forest and whether it is a land in the actual possession of the petitioners or not and whether the petitioners have got any right to be in possession of such land etc. are matters which cannot be considered and decided in this petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. 14. It is well settled that, in a petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C for quashing preliminary report of charge, this Court shall not embark upon the validity and reliability of the evidence available. Factual disputes cannot be decided in a petition filed under Section 482 CrP.C. All that the Court shall examine is whether there are allegations in the first information report or the complaint which form the basis to constitute the ingredients of the offences alleged against the accused. 15. In the instant case, prima facie, the occurrence report and the mahazar prepared by the forest officers reveal the necessary basic ingredients of the offences alleged against the petitioners. Therefore, the prayer in the petition for quashing the proceedings against the petitioners cannot be allowed. The petition is liable to be dismissed. Feel 2020/KER/81 Cr1.M.C.No.6072/2019 9 Consequently, the petition is dismissed.
