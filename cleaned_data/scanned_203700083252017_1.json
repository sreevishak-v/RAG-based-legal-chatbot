ANNEXURE A2 THE ORDER PASSED BY THE LEARNED JUDICIAL FIRST CLASS MAGISTRATE COURT, KARUNAGAPPALLY IN CMP NO.3270/2017 DATED 05/10/2017. RESPONDENT (S)' EXHIBITS :- NIL //TRUE COPY// P.A. TO JUDGE 2017/KER/49571 P.UBAID, J. Dated this the 7\" day of December 2017 ORDER The petitioner claims to be the registered owner of the motorcycle No.KL-02-AR-9235. On 17.9.2017 at about 7.30 p.m., a small quantity of 20 gms of ganja was seized from the possession of the petitioner by the Excise Inspector of the Karunagappally Excise Range. The petitioner's motorcycle was also seized by the Excise Inspector at that time. Later, the motorcycle was released to the petitioner under Section 451 Cr.P.C. by the learned Judicial First Class Magistrate, Karunagappally on certain conditions as per the order in CMP.3270/2017 dated 5.10.2017. The petitioner is aggrieved by the condition directing deposit of a cash security of %31,500/-, and the said condition is sought to be set aside. 2. On hearing both sides, and on a perusal of the materials, I find nothing to show that the vehicle was in fact used for the transportation of ganja. Just because it is the vehicle on which the accused travelled, it cannot be confiscated under the law. The small quantity of ganja was seized from the 2017/KER/49571 Crl.M.C. No.8325 of 2017 Qe possession of the accused. It was not concealed any where on the vehicle, and the vehicle was not in any manner used for the transportation of ganja. Any way, proceedings are now going on, rightly or wrongly. 3. Inthe above circumstances, where the very seizure of the vehicle was quite unnecessary, I feel it appropriate to set aside the condition directing cash security for the interim custody of the vehicle under Section 451 Cr.P.C. The other conditions imposed by the court below will suffice to cause production of the vehicle, as and when required. In the result, this petition is allowed. The impugned condition directing cash security of %31,500/- will stand set aside. Sd/- P.UBAID JUDGE //True copy// P.A. To Judge Jvt/7.12.2017"
