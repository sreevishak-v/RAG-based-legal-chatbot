CHALY, J. Dated this the 1* day of August, 2016 JUDGMENT Petitioner herein has availed an agricultural loan from the 4\" respondent bank. Petitioner could not repay the loan due to failure of crops. Thereupon, petitioner approached the Farmers' Debt Relief Commission and secured Ext.P1 order. In terms of Ext.P1, evident from Ext.P2 demand draft, petitioner has remitted Rs.50,000/- to the 4\" respondent bank. The grievance voiced by the petitioner in this writ petition is that, the respondent bank is not returning the original title deed of the petitioner stating that, petitioner has not cleared the dues towards the bank. According to the petitioner, the above stand adopted by respondents 4 and 5 is against the final order passed by the Kerala State Farmers' Debt Relief Commission. It is in this backdrop, this writ petition is filed. 2. Fourth respondent has filed a counter affidavit refuting the allegations and claims and demands made by the BIR h 2016/KER/33743 W.P.(C). No.23366 of 2013 2 petitioner. It is contended that, the loan account can be closed on making payment of Rs.67,510/- viz., Rs.38,320/- towards the principal amount and Rs.28,190/- towards interest, apart from the interest accrued till date. It is also contended that, the bank has never taken a stand that, it is not bound by Ext.P1 award. There is no reason for the bank to challenge Ext.P1 as well. The relief claimed cannot be granted. The 4 respondent has already clarified the position by its letter dated 31.1.2014 addressed to the 3 respondent before the petitioner has filed the complaint. The true copy of the said letter is produced as Ext.R4(a). Therefore, it is contended by the 4\" respondent that, petitioner is not entitled to get any relief in this writ petition. 3. Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, learned Government Pleader, learned counsel appearing for respondents 4 and 5 and perused the pleadings and documents on record. 4. The prime contention advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner is based on Section 5(4) of the Kerala Farmers Debt Relief Commission Act which reads thus: Eaves 2016/KER/33743 W.P.(C). No.23366 of 2013 3 That an award passed by the Commission under clause (d) of sub-section (1) shall be final and shall not be called in question in any court. Section 5(d) enables the Commission to adjudicate disputes between the farmers described in clause (b) and creditors, other than institutional creditors, and to pass awards which shall be binding on both parties. Learned counsel has also invited my attention to sub-section(3) of Section 5 which is a non-obstante clause which says that notwithstanding anything contained in any other provisions of this Act, any debt relief granted to a farmer by way of waiver of principal, interest and penal interest, if any shall not exceed seventy five per cent, if such debt is fifty thousand rupees or less, and fifty percent, if such debt exceeds fifty thousand rupees, arrived at after settlement or rupees one lakh whichever is less. Therefore, According to the learned counsel for the petitioner, Ext.P1 order passed by the Farmers Debt relief Commission has become final. Neither the petitioner nor the 4\" respondent did not challenge the BIR h 2016/KER/33743 W.P.(C). No.23366 of 2013 4 said order. It is seen from Ext.P2 that, petitioner has complied with the direction contained in Ext.P1 order by making a payment of Rs.50,000/-. Therefore, according to the petitioner, on payment of the said amount, the 4 respondent ought to have returned the title deed of the property mortgaged by the petitioner since the entire debt due as per Ext.P1 order has been remitted by the petitioner. It is also found that, since the 4\" respondent did not return the title deed, petitioner has approached the Munsiff Court, Ettumanoor. However, the Munsiff Court has dismissed the suit filed by the petitioner as per Ext.P5 judgment holding that, the Munsiff Court does not have the power to entertain the suit of said nature since there is a prohibition created under Section 69 of the Kerala Co-operative Societies Act. 5. On the other hand, learned counsel for the 4 respondent submitted that as per Ext.P1 order, the Debt Relief Commission has considered the dues as on the said date. Subsequently interest has fallen due to the already remaining principal amount and therefore, the petitioner is BIR h 2016/KER/33743 W.P.(C). No.23366 of 2013 5 bound to pay altogether an amount of Rs.67,510/- and on payment of which alone, the 4\" respondent is liable to return the title deed of the property of the petitioner. 6. Taking into account the respective submissions and totality of the circumstances involved in the writ petition, Iam of the considered opinion that, Ext.P1 has become final and as provided under Section 5(4) of the Farmers' Debt Relief Commission Act, the order passed by the Commission is final and binding on the respective parties. If at all the respondents had any case that, Ext.P1 order is only with respect to the loan outstanding as on the said date of the order, definitely there would have been a finding accordingly in Ext.P1 order. The 4\" respondent has also not sought any clarification in tune with Ext.R4(a) filed along with the counter affidavit to the effect that, till such time the amounts claimed in Ext.R4(a) is due, 4\" respondent is not bound to return the title deed to the petitioner in terms of rule 17 of the Rules provided under the Act. Therefore, in my considered opinion, at this belated point of time, 4\" Dee pee 2016/KER/33743 W.P.(C). No.23366 of 2013 6 respondent cannot attack Ext.P1 order passed by the Farmers' Debt Relief Commission in any manner. 7. Upshot of the above discussion is that, petitioner is entitled to succeed in the writ petition and accordingly there will be a direction to the 4\" and 5\" respondents to return the title deeds of the property of the petitioner bearing No.3037/1968 and 3004/1974 within three weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment. Writ petition is allowed accordingly. Sd/- SHAJI P. CHALY JUDGE smv 01.08.2016"
