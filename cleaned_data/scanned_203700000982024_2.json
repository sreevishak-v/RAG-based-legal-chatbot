Crl.M.C.No.98 of 2024 Dated this the 22\" day of January 2024 ORDER Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C to quash all proceedings against him. 2. Petitioner is the sole accused in Crime No.2314/2023 of Palarivattom Police Station, registered for the offences under Sections 406 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The 3 respondent is the defacto complainant. 3. According to the prosecution, on 06.10.2023 the defacto complainant went for an Ayurvedic treatment and the accused failed to provide the treatment or return the money and thereby committed the offences alleged. 4. Heard the learned Counsel for the petitioner and the learned Counsel for the respondent apart from the learned Public Prosecutor. 5. The learned Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the matter has been settled and hence the proceedings against the petitioner ought to be quashed. It was also submitted that, considering the nature of offences alleged, no purpose would be served by continuing the proceedings. 6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303], the Apex Court has held that in appropriate cases, the High Court can Bupa Be ane 2024/KER/6445 CRL.MC NO.98 OF 2024 3 take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. This view was reiterated in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466] and Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State of Jharkhand and Another [(2014) 9 SCC 653]. 7. | have perused Annexure A2 affidavit filed by the 3\" respondent. The learned Public Prosecutor has submitted that upon verification, it is understood that the affidavit is genuine, and the defacto complainant stands by the contens thereof. I am satisfied that the matter has been settled and no public interest is involved in this case. There is no impediment for granting the prayer for quashing. The continuance of the proceedings will only be an exercise in futility. 8. Accordingly, all proceedings against the petitioner in Crime No.2314/2023 of Palarivattom Police Station are quashed. This Crl.M.C is allowed.
