BY ADV. SRI.M.SREEKUMAR RESPONDENT (S) /STATE. : STATE OF KERALA, REPRESENTED BY THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR, HIGH COURT OF KERALA, ERNAKULAM.682031. BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR SRI E.C.BINEESH THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 04-10-2016, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: K.V. nS 2016/KER/42489 SUNIL THOMAS, J. Dated this the 4\" day of October, 2016 ORDER The petitioner herein is the 1* accused in S.C. No.1075/2010 of 1* Additional Assistant Sessions Court, Thiruvananthapuram, who stands indicted for offences punishable under Sections 498A, 306 read with 34 of IPC. The matter is now pending before the 4\" Additional Sessions Court, Thiruvananthapuram as_ S.C. No.100/2014. The charge was read over on 20.09.2016 and thereafter, the matter was scheduled for trial from 17.10.2016 to 19.10.2016. 2. The grievance of the petitioner herein is that, the counsel for the petitioner is engaged in other pre-fixed matters and hence he is not in a position to conduct the trial on those dates. It was submitted that, the matter was brought to the notice of the court below which was turned down and the court proceeded to post the case on 17.10.2016. According to the petitioner, he had engaged a lawyer about 4 years back and at this stage change of the lawyer is not possible. Learned counsel seeks appropriate reliefs invoking Section 482 Cr.P.C. nS 2016/KER/42489 Cri. M. C. No. 6581 of 2016 2 3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor. 4. The grievance of the petitioner is based on the inconvenience of the lawyer who is engaged in other trial fixed on those dates. Essentially scheduling a matter by a trial court is dependent on the pendency of cases, whether the case is ripe and other priorities including the availability time. When the court exercise that discretion it may not be proper on the part of the High Court to exercise Section 482 Cr.P.C. to upset the schedule. 5. Having regard to these, | am not inclined to interfere with the schedule now fixed by the court below. However, if the petitioner has a genuine grievance, he may move the court below with an appropriate application based on the available records establishing, the inconvenience, so that the court can evaluate the available materials and pass a considered order. Crl.M.C. is disposed of. Sd/- : SUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE. n"
