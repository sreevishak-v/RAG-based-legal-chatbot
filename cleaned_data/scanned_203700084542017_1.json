PA TO JUDGE SUNIL THOMAS, J. 2017/KER/49780 Crl.M.C.No.8454 of 2017 Dated this the 8 day of December, 2017 ORDER The petitioner sought anticipatory bail in Crime No.311/2017 of Valancheri Police Station for offences punishable under sections 341, 448, 323, 354 and 506(1) read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. 2. The allegation of the prosecution was that on 28.10.2017 at 21.15 hours, the accused trespassed into the house of the defacto complainant restrained her, her mother and grand mother. Thereafter, they were beaten up. There is a further allegation that the third accused tore her nightly and molested her. When the anticipatory bail application came up before the learned Sessions Judge, the learned Sessions Judge noticed that the accused 1 to 4 attacked the defacto complainant and others since she had _ claimed Rs.4,75,000/- as maintenance granted by the Family Court. It appears that the petitioners are the husband and in-laws of the defacto complainant. Having considered the entire facts, 2017/KER/49780 Crl.M.C.No.8454 of 2017 2 the learned Judge by order dated 18.11.2017, which is produced as Annexure-A, granted bail, inter alia, on a condition that he shall remit 50% of the arrears of the maintenance if any before the Family Court and produce the receipt before the investigating officer before executing the bond. That portion of the order is under challenge in the present proceedings. 3. After hearing the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor though the intention of the court below in imposing such a condition that may appear to be prima facie appreciable, legally it does not appear to be sustainable. Granting of bail, should not be dependant on a condition of deposit of the portion of the money in a different proceedings between parties. It was submitted by the learned counsel for the first petitioner that the total amount due is only Rs.2,43,000/- out of he has deposited a sum of Rs.1,02,000/-. A statement which has been filed by the learned counsel for the petitioner to that effect. Without Eevee Bi Geis i ees 2017/KER/49780 Crl.M.C.No.8454 of 2017 3 going into the dispute as to how much amount is due and the amount deposited, I am inclined to interfere with the condition No.2 issued by the court below. Hence, Crl.M.C will stand allowed and the petitioner herein shall comply with the Annexure-Al order except condition No.2, which shall not be insisted upon. The petitioner shall comply with all other conditions than condition No.2. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE R.AV //True Copy// PA to Judge"
