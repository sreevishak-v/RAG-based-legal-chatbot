The petitioners are alleged to have committed the offences punishable under Sections 296(b), 126(2), 115(2) and 117(2) r/w Section 3(5)of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and Crime No.190/2025 of Criminal M.C.No.614/2025 1/2 Kallambalam Police Station is registered against the petitioners, arraying them as accused. 3. Heard. On a perusal of the report submitted by the Investigating Officer, it is found that all the offences alleged against the petitioners are bailable. As per section 482 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the condition precedent for invoking the powers provided under the said provision is that the petitioner apprehends that he might be arrested on accusation of having committed a non-bailable offence. In this circumstance, the application cannot be entertained. In the result, the petition is dismissed as not maintainable, without prejudice to the right of the petitioners to take bail from the Jurisdictional Court. Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and pronounced by me in Open Court on this the 3\" day of March, 2025.
