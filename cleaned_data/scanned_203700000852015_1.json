ANNEXURE 3: COPY OF THE AFFIDAVIT SWORN BY THE 2ND RESPONDENT REGARDING THE COMPROMISE DATED 1.11.2014 RESPONDENT'S ANNEXURES : NIL //TRUE COPY// P.A TO JUDGE ab Biehl Capea 2015/KER/783 P.UBAID, J. Dated this the 8 day of January, 2015 ORDER The petitioners herein are the four accused in C.C. No.689/2011 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court I, Kollam. Crime in the said case was registered under Sections 143, 147, 341, 323 and 324 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code, on the complaint of one Praveen. The petitioners now seek orders quashing the prosecution as against them on the ground that they and the defacto complainant have amicably settled the dispute out of court. The defacto complainant Praveen is the second respondent in this proceeding. He has filed affidavit to the effect that he has settled the whole dispute with the accused, and he has no complaint or grievance now. I am well satisfied that there is a real and genuine settlement between the parties, and I find that continuance of prosecution in such a situation will not serve any purpose, other than wasting the precious time of the court. The petitioners seek orders under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure because composition as such is not possible. Biieiaael Capea 2015/KER/783 Crl.M.C No.85 of 2015 2 In the result, this Criminal Miscellaneous Case is allowed. The prosecution against the petitioners herein in C.C No.689/2011 before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court I, Kollam, will stand quashed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Accordingly, the petitioners will stand released from prosecution, and the bail bond, if any, executed by them will stand discharged. P.UBAID JUDGE ab"
