HASHIM ALTHAF OTHER PRESENT: PP T.R.RENJITH THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 08.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: ie CRL.M.C.NO.5584 OF 2020 ; 202UKER/I361 ORDER Dated this the 8th day of January 2021 Petitioners are accused Nos.1 to 7 in Crime No.183/2019 registered at the Kuruppanpadi Police Station, Ernakulam for offences punishable under Sections 341, 323, 294(b), 143, 147, 149 of IPC, now pending as C.C.No.132/2019 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-III, Perumbavoor. The de facto complainants, at whose instance the crime was registered, are arrayed as the 27 and 3** respondents. Annexure-A3 and Annexure-A3 (a) affidavits have been filed by 2 and 3** respondents stating that the dispute, which was the reason for the incident and registration of the crime, have been resolved amicably and they have no subsisting grievance against ie CRL.M.C.NO.5584 OF 2020 ; 2021/KER/1361 the petitioners. 2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also, who, on instructions, submits that the petitioners have no criminal antecedents. 3. Having considered the gravity of the offences alleged, nature of the injury caused and having perused the affidavits filed by the 2 and 3** respondent, the contents of which are submitted to be true and voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled and no public interest is involved in this matter. Moreover, in view of the settlement, possibility of the criminal proceedings ending in conviction is remote. As such, continuance of the proceedings will amount to an abuse of process of court and hence, in view of the legal position set out by the Honourable Supreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh irae CRL.M.C.NO.5584 OF 2020 . 202 1U/KER/1361 v. State of Punjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is no impediment in granting the relief sought. In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. The proceedings in C.C.No.132/2019 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-III, Perumbavoor is quashed.
