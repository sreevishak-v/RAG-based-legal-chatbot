ANNEXURE-A2: THE TRUE COPY OF THE 23.12.2015 IN CRL.M.C. NO.8031/2015 OF THIS HON'BLE COURT. RESPONDENT (S)' EXHIBITS NIL /TRUE COPY/ PS TO JUDGE. Plsipias 2016/KER/33876 SUNIL THOMAS, J. Crl.M.C.No.4267 of 2016 Dated this the 3\" day of August, 2016 ORDER The petitioner herein stands accused in Crime No.417/2014 of Thiruvalla police station for offences punishable under Sections 8 & 12 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act,2012. 2. Considering the fact that the petitioner belongs to West Bengal, he was granted bail by Annexure Al order dated 31/3/2014 subject to several conditions inter alia that he shall execute a bond for a sum of Rs.3,00,000/- with two sureties each. Thereafter, he approached this Court by filing Cri.M.C.No.8031/2015 contending that the condition imposed by that Court was too onerous and sought for relaxation of the condition. By Annexure A2, this court modified the condition No. 1 in Annexure Al with regard to one surety, inter alia, by directing that any resident of Kerala be a relative or not, can be accepted by the court, if that surety is solvent to the extent of Rs. 3 Lakhs fixed by the trial court. 3. The petitioner herein has again approached this court contending that even after the modified order passed by this Plsipias 2016/KER/33876 Cri.M.C.No.4267/2016 2 Court on 23/12/2015, still the petitioner could not find two sureties who are willing to offer themselves as sureties for the bond amount of Rs.3 Lakhs. 4. It is evident that in spite of a favourable order, the petitioner herein could not obtain sureties for execution of bond of Rs. 3 Lakhs. It seems that the above condition has become unworkable as far as the petitioner herein is concerned. Hence, I feel that a lenient view is liable to be taken and the bond amount ordered to be executed by the sureties is slashed down to Rs. One Lakhs each. All other conditions will remain. In the event of the petitioner herein again finding difficulty in executing a bond as above, the court below shall expedite the trial having regard to the fact that the petitioner herein is under trial. Crl.M.C.is disposed of with the above directions. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS Judge dpk /true copy/ PS to Judge. Ips Be 2016/KER/33876 Crl.M.C.No.4267/2016 3"
