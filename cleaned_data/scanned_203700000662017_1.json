SRI.ENOCH DAVID SIMON JOEL RESPONDENT (S) : STATE OF KERALA REPRESENTED BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR HIGH COURT OF KERALA, ERNAKULAM BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR: SRI T R RANJITH THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 05-01-2017, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: oe 2017/KER/462 SUNIL THOMAS, J. Crl.M.C.No.66 of 2017 Dated this the 5\" day of January, 2017 ORDER Petitioners are accused Nos.1 to 3 and 6 in C.C.No.612 of 2009 of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Thiruvananthapuram for offences punishable under sections 143, 147, 149, 283, 294(b), 332, 353 of the Indian Penal Code. 2. Petitioners appeared before the court below through the counsel in the above crime. Thereafter, they were either appearing personally or were being represented by the counsel. The matter stood posted to 16.02.2016, on which day, petitioners were absent. Hence, court below issued non bailable warrant against the petitioners. Bail bond was also cancelled. 3. Petitioners, contending that due to an inadvertent communication gap with the counsel in informing about the case remained absent and that, there was no willful latches on their side have approached this Court seeking reliefs. It is submitted that petitioners are ready to surrender before the magistrate and to seek fresh bail. They apprehend that since the non bailable warrant is pending, application for bail is not likely to be taken up on the same a 2017/KER/462 Crl.M.C.66/17 2 day of surrender itself. A. Having considered the entire facts, I feel that since the petitioners have been appearing promptly before the court earlier, some leniency can be shown to the petitioners herein. This is especially in the background that they offered to appear before the court below and to participate in the future proceedings. In the result, Crl.M.C is disposed of directing the petitioners herein to appear before the jurisdictional court within ten days from today and to seek bail. In the event of any application for bail being filed, court below shall take it up on the same day itself and pass appropriate orders in the light of what is stated above. Warrant issued by the court below will be kept in abeyance till the appearance of the petitioners within the above stipulated period. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS Judge Sbna/5/1/17 True Copy / P A to Judge"
