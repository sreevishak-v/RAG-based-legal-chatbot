ANNEXURE ITI TRUE COPY OF THE AADHAR CARD OF THE PETITIONER. ANNEXURE IIT TRUE COPY OF THE TREATMENT RECORD OF THE PETITIONER. ANNEXURE IV AFFIDAVIT SWORN BY THE 2ND RESPONDENT DATED 02.08.2017. RESPONDENT (S)' EXHIBITS : NIL /TRUE COPY/ P. A. TO JUDGE Pn a 2017/KER/49553 SUNIL THOMAS, J. Dated this the 7 day of December, 2017 ORDER The petitioner stands arrayed as the sole accused in Crime No.955/2017 of Puthoor Police Station, Kollam District for offences punishable under Sections 354, 354 (A) (i) (ii) (ili) (iv), 506(i) and 509 of IPC. The allegation of the de facto complainant, who is arrayed as the 2 respondent herein is that after the marriage of the 2\" respondent with the son of the petitioner herein on 25.08.2013, the petitioner used to sexually harass her. It is alleged that the petitioner used to make sexual advances towards her. On the basis of the complaint laid, crime was registered and the investigation is progressing. 2. In the meanwhile, the petitioner has approached this Court to quash the proceedings on a premise that the dispute arose from a matrimonial discord between the 2\"? respondent and her husband, who is the son of the petitioner herein. It is submitted that matrimonial disputes were sorted out and after realizing that the complaint was laid under the strained relationship, an affidavit has been filed. a 2017/KER/49553 Cri. M. C. No. 6245 of 2017 2 3. The learned Senior counsel for the 2\" respondent and the the learned counsel for the petitioner invited my attention to Annexure IV affidavit affirmed by the 2 respondent. At paragraph 4 of the affidavit she has asserted that there were some dispute between herself and her husband and the father-in- law, without ascertaining the facts, blindly supported his son. In such circumstance being frustrated, she was forced to lay a complaint. It was also stated that the disputes have now been sorted out between the parties and application for divorce is filed. Learned counsel for the petitioner invited my attention to a complaint, which the 2 respondent laid before the SHO of Puthoor on 20.06.2017. A copy of that complaint which was obtained by the petitioner herein under the RTI Act was placed before me at the time of hearing. In the above complaint she has only referred to physical harassment by the petitioner herein though there is a vague reference that the father-in-law had caught hold of her. She has stated that she suppressed it to maintain the matrimonial relationship. However, Annexure | FIS indicates more serious allegations which are not seen disclosed in the complaint. 4. Parties are closely related. It is seen that matrimonial a 2017/KER/49553 Cri. M. C. No. 6245 of 2017 3 relationship is between the son of the petitioner and 2\" respondent. Hence there is reasonable chance of 2\" respondent having set up a baseless allegation. This is reiterated by the complaint dated 20.06.2017, in which the serious allegations are conspicuously absent. Even the FIS relates to incidents that happened much earlier. Having considered these facts, the settlement arrived at between the parties and fact that the petitioner is a 71 year old man, | am inclined to invoke the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to ensure that the cordial relationship between the parties continue and the dispute being purely personal, family issue. Hence, Crl.M.C. is allowed. All further proceedings in Crime No.955/2017 of Puthoor Police Station, Kollam District stand quashed. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE. Pn"
