No.523/2025 (Crime No.150/2025 of Aruvikkara Police Station) Petitioner/Accused No.8:- Sudha Devi.S, aged 55 years, W/o late M Mohankumar, KrishnaKripa, Mundela P.O, Aruvikkara, Thiruvananthapuram-695543 By Advocates:-Sonay John, Soniya.S, Jobin J Abraham, R.B. Rahul Raj and Rohit.R Counter Petitioners:- 1. State of Kerala 2. The Inspector of Police, Aruvikkara Police Station, Thiruvananthapuram By Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumary This petition came up for hearing on 25/02/2025 and the court on 28/02/2025 passed the following : ORDER This is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail. 2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable under Sections 409 and 420, r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, and Crime Criminal M.C.No.523/2025 1/6 No. 150/2025 of Aruvikkara Police Station is registered against the petitioner/ 8\" accused. 3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- The accused Nos. 1 to 16, who were the staff of Rajiv Gandhi Residents Welfare Co-operative Society situated in Nedumangadu Taluk, in furtherance of their common intention to obtain wrongful gain and to cause wrongful loss to the depositors in the Society, during the period from 01.04.2021 to 31.05.2024, committed misappropriation in the deposits, and obtained a total sum of Rs.24,74,21,480/- from them. 4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The Investigating Officer filed report opposing the anticipatory bail application. Case Diary is produced. 5. Heard. Perused the records. 6. The only point to be considered is, whether an order of anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioner/ 8\" accused. 7. The Point:- The petitioner is the wife of the 1* accused and she is arrayed as the 8\" accused. The 1 accused was the President of Rajiv Gandhi Residents Welfare Co-operative Society. The petitioner / 8\" accused was an employee of Thiruvananthapuram Service Co-operative Society. The defacto Criminal M.C.No.523/2025 2/6 complainant was the Part-Time Administrator of Rajiv Gandhi Residents Welfare Co-operative Society. The prosecution allegation is that, the accused persons have committed misappropriation of around Rs.24,74,21,480/- by taking loan in benami names and by way of advance MDS. The specific allegation against petitioner / 8\" accused is that, she had pledged the property in her name as security for obtaining different loans and MDS. 8. The petitioner submits that, she is working as a Clerk in the Thiruvananthapuram Service Co-operative Bank, and is not having any criminal antecedents. It is submitted that, the husband of the petitioner, M.Mohankumar, who was the President of the Rajiv Gandhi Residents Welfare Co-operative Society, Mundela, and a well-known political figure, committed suicide on 20.11.2024, after being falsely accused of misappropriating funds from the said Society, and since then, the family of the petitioner is under threat from the members of various political parties, and many individuals claim to have deposited exorbitant amounts in the Society and are now targeting the petitioner and her family. It is also submitted that, more than 60 F.I.Rs have been registered against the office bearers of the Society based on various complaints, however, the petitioner was never named as an accused in any of those F.I-Rs., since she did not hold any post in the said Society. The petitioner submitted that, thereafter, on Criminal M.C.No.523/2025 3/6 06.02.2025, the Aruvikkara Police registered an F.I.R. against the petitioner and 15 others, including her late husband, alleging misappropriation of over Rs. 24 Crores from the Society, and that was due to political pressure with the sole intention of harassing the petitioner and her family. She further submitted that, the essential ingredients required to establish the offence under Section 420 IPC are absent in this case, since there was no intention to deceive anyone. 9. The allegation against the petitioner is not grave. The allegation against the petitioner is misappropriation of amount deposited by the depositors. On perusal of the Case Diary, it is seen that, when a search was conducted in the Nedumangadu Employees Service Co-operative Bank, where the husband of the petitioner was the President, some documents in the name of the petitioner and agreements were seized. No other materials are placed against the petitioner. The petitioners counsel contended that, no property was in the name of the petitioner. Even if some documents were found in the name of the petitioner, the relevance of the same in the implication of the crime and the dishonest intention of the petitioner is a matter of evidence. The exact role of the petitioner is not brought out by the prosecution. It appears that there is no prima facie case against the petitioner. It would be a travesty of justice, if the petitioner is put behind the bars, Criminal M.C.No.523/2025 4/6 if she has not committed any offence. No criminal antecedents of the petitioner is brought to the notice of this court. 10. In view of my discussion above, it appears that there is no impediment in granting a pre-arrest bail to the petitioner. Considering all these aspects, it is found that this is a fit case where a pre-arrest bail can be granted to the petitioner. In the result, the petition is allowed on the following conditions:- (1) In the event of arrest, the petitioner/ 8\" accused shall be released on bail on her executing bond for Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) with two solvent sureties for the like sum each to the satisfaction of the arresting officer/Investigating Officer, as the case may be. (2) Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer between 10 a.m. and 11 am. on every Wednesday for a period of 3 (three) months or till the filing of the final report, whichever is earlier. (3) Petitioner shall also appear before the Investigating Officer as and when required. (4) Petitioner shall not commit any offence while on bail. (5) Petitioner shall not attempt to contact the defacto complainant or any of the prosecution witnesses, directly or through any Criminal M.C.No.523/2025 5/6 other person, or in any other way try to tamper with the evidence or influence any witnesses or other persons related to the investigation. In case of any violation of the above conditions or misuse of liberty, the prosecution or the defacto complainant is at liberty to approach jurisdictional court for cancellation of bail.
