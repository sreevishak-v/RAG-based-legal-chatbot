Dated this the 6 day of December, 2017 ORDER The petitioners herein challenged Annexures Al & A4 FIRs and Annexure A5 final report laid in the above FIRs. The crux of the allegation of the 3 respondent herein was that, on 02.04.2014 at about 2.30 p.m., the accused assaulted the 3 respondent herein and her family members and caused bodily injuries. It was alleged that with the intention of humiliating and downgrading her and outraging her modesty, being a member of a scheduled caste, the petitioners uttered abusive words and committed overt acts. She laid FIS which was registered as FIR No.15/2014 evidenced by Anneuxre 1 for offences punishable under Sections 323, 354 read with Section 34 of IPC. Subsequently, she along with her husband and son filed Annexure 3 petition before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court 1, Changanacherry alleging that though various offences were made out and complaint was laid to the Police, they after registering a crime did not conduct an effective investigation. It was also alleged that the main offence under SC/ST (POA) Act were not incorporated in the FIR. Invoking Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C. 2017/KER/49288 Cri. M. C. No. 5307 of 2017 2 Annexure 3 was referred to the Police, who after registering Annexure 4 FIR No.504/2014 for offences punishable under Sections 141, 149, 294(a),(b), 323, 324, 354, 441 of IPC and Sections 3(1)(x)(xi) and (xv), 3(2)(VIl) 4 of SC/ST POA Act, investigated into the allegations. Later, finding that the place of incident and the subject matter involved in both the FIS were the same, they were clubbed together and report was given to the court. After completion of investigation final report was laid as Annexure 5. 2. The petitioners, contending that two FIRs in relation to the same incident is impermissible, that the learned Magistrate, even after being informed about the registration of crime went on invoking Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C. and ought to have invoked the provision under Section 210 Cr.P.C. and further that on merits the offence under SC/ST (POA) Act was not made out, sought to quash both the FIS and the final report. Learned counsel for the petitioners, relied on the decision reported in Babubhai V. State of Gujarat and Others [(2010) 12 SCC 254] contended that more than one FIR is not permissible and if both the FIRs satisfy the test of sameness, the second FIR is liable to be quashed. On 2017/KER/49288 Cri. M. C. No. 5307 of 2017 3 the other hand, learned counsel for the 3\" respondent contended that though Annexure Al FIR was laid, the investigating agency did not incorporate the relevant offences that were made out in the FIS and did not conduct proper investigation. Hence, the 3% respondent was justified in invoking the jurisdiction of the learned Magistrate and the Magistrate was perfectly justified in invoking Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. To buttress the argument, the learned counsel relied on the decision reported in Antony V. State of Kerala [2001 (3) KLT 1 (SC)]. 3. Annexure 5 final report itself shows that after the registration of the second FIR, on finding that the allegations related to the same incident, both were clubbed together and a single investigation was conducted. It ended in Annexure 5 final report. In Babubhai's case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court had specifically held that there cannot be more than one FIR in relation to the same cognizable offence. However, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that, in the case of a subsequent FIR, the Court has to examine the facts and circumstances giving rise to both the FIRs and the test of sameness is to be applied to find out whether both the FIRs related to the same incident in respect of 2017/KER/49288 Cri. M. C. No. 5307 of 2017 4 Same occurrence or are in regard to the incidents which were two or more parts of the same transaction. 4. A perusal of Annexure 1 show that it related to offences punishable under Sections 323, 354 and 34 IPC. The allegations in the second FIS as well as in the private complaint were on a different footing, though it related to the same incident. To that extent, it cannot be said that there was sameness of FIRs in both cases. In the above circumstance, the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Antony's case appear to be more applicable to the facts of this case. Evidently, in the case at hand, there was no fresh investigation pursuant to the second FIR. In fact there was only single investigation after the registration of both the crimes. 5. It was vehemently contended by the learned counsel for the petitioners that the offence under the SC/ST (POA) Act was not made out and that the predominant motive involved was the property dispute. It was contended that the allegations raised against the accused can only constitute, if at all, an offence under Section 354 IPC and not under Section 3 of the SC/ST (POA) Act. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the 3 respondent 2017/KER/49288 Cri. M. C. No. 5307 of 2017 5 relied on the decision reported in Manju Devi V. Onkarjit Singh Ahluwalia alias Omkarjeet Singh and Others (2017 Crl.L.]. 2879), wherein, the Hon'ble Supreme Court had made the clear distinction between an offence under Section 354 IPC and one under Section 3 of SC/ST (POA) Act at paragraphs 14 & 15. According to the Hon'ble Supreme Court when caste name is used, that stands on a different footing from a mere offence under Section 354 IPC. According to the Hon'ble Supreme Court it involves an element of insulting the member of that community. Of course, this is a matter to be established in the course of evidence. According to the learned counsel for the petitioners, 5 witnesses have been arrayed to establish the factual allegations. Definitely the evidence of the witnesses has to stand the test of cross examination. At this stage prima facie it cannot be said that the ingredients of SC/ST (POA) Act is not made out and hence liable to be quashed, at the initial stage itself. 6. Having considered these, | find no merit in the contention set up by the petitioners and the Crl.M.C. is liable to dismissed. However, the petitioners will be entitled to raise all their objections before the court below and also urge the 2017/KER/49288 Cri. M. C. No. 5307 of 2017 6 contentions raised here also. It is made clear that no finding is arrived at regarding the allegations made by the petitioners herein and whatever conclusions mentioned above are only for the limited purpose of considering whether the provision under Section 482 Cr.P.C. is liable to be invoked at this stage. Learned counsel for the petitioners at this stage submitted that personal exemption of the petitioners may be permitted. If appropriate application is filed, the court below may consider the applications in accordance with law. Crl.M.C. is dismissed as above. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE. Pn"
