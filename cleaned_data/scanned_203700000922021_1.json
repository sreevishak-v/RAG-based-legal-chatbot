The vehicle was seized by the 3? respondent alleging violation of the provisions of the Kerala Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 2015 and the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. After seizure, the petitioner's vehicle was produced before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court (Temporary), south Paravur.

The BIPREe CR.M.C.NO.92 OF 2021 ; 202 U/KERIISE petitioner complied with the conditions and the vehicle was released. 2. This Crl.M.C is filed aggrieved by condition No.4(7)in Annexure Al order, directing the original documents produced before the court to be retained in court custody and to issue true certified copies of those documents to the petitioner. Annexure A2 is a similar order passed by this Court whereby, conditions akin to condition No.4(7) in Annexure Al were modified. 3. On the facts of this case and in view of the earlier order passed by this Court under similar circumstances, I am inclined to grant the relief sought.
