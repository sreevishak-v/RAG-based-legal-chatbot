R2 BY SMT V SREEJA-PP THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 05.11.2019, THE COURT ON 06.01.2020 PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Biigall bie Crl.MC.No.3318 OF 2018 2020/KERIS 2 R. NARAYANA PISHARADI, J Cril.M.C No. 3318 of 2018 ORDER The petitioner is the sole accused in the case C.C No. 901/2015 on the file of the Court of the Judicial First Class Magistrate, Chittur. 2. The prosecution case is that on 15.02.2015, at about 19:30 hours, the petitioner/accused hit on the face of the de facto complainant with a hammer causing fracture to the bones of his nose and jaw and thereby the petitioner committed an offence punishable under Section 326 IPC. 3. The case against the petitioner was registered as Crime No. 196/2015 of Chittur Police Station on the basis of the statement given to the police by the de facto complainant. After completing the investigation, final report was filed against the petitioner for an offence punishable under Section 326 IPC and the learned Magistrate has taken cognizance of the offence. 4. This petition is filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C for quashing the proceedings against the petitioner in the case on the ground that he is totally innocent. bie Crl.MC.No.3318 OF 2018 2020/KERIS 3 5. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor and also the first respondent/de facto complainant. 6. The allegations against the petitioner in the chargesheet, prima facie, disclose the commission of an offence punishable under Section 326 IPC by him. 7. The witness list filed by the prosecution along with the chargesheet shows that, apart from the de facto complainant/injured, seven other eye-witnesses are cited by the prosecution to prove the alleged incident. Further, there is also medical evidence to be adduced to prove the injuries sustained by the de facto complainant. The hammer alleged to have been used by the petitioner for committing the offence has also been recovered and produced before the trial court. 8. Whether the hammer recovered by the police is a dangerous weapon or not, whether the injuries sustained by the de facto complainant could have been caused by that hammer etc. are matters of evidence. 9. The plea of the petitioner that it was the de facto complainant and his relatives who attacked him and that he had acted only in self defence is also a plea to be raised before the trial court and to be proved by him before that court. Crl.MC.No.3318 OF 2018 2020/KERIS 4 10. In the aforesaid circumstances, I find that there are no sufficient grounds to quash the chargesheet filed against the petitioner or the proceedings initiated against him on the basis of the chargesheet. Consequently, the petition is dismissed. Sd/-R.
