The petitioner rely on Section 102(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure to contend that the respondents 2 to 4 are duty bound to report the seizure to the jurisdictional Magistrate Court, failing which the petitioner will be denied an opportunity to move for interim custody under Section Crl.MC.No.5820 OF 2020 (F) Be. 202 1/KER/T387 451 CrPC. 2. l heard the learned Public Prosecutor also. The learned Public Prosecutor submits that the vehicle was seized by the 3 respondent as directed by the 4 respondent and handed over to the Police for custody. I find merit in the contention that, having seized the vehicle, the respondents 2 to 4 are bound to report the seizure to the jurisdictional Magistrate Court. Accordingly, the Crl.M.C is disposed of with the following directions; (i) The competent among respondents 2 to 4 shall report seizure of the vehicle bearing registration No.KL-40-D-2221 covered by Annexure-I to the jurisdictional Magistrate Court within one week of receipt of a copy of a copy of this judgment.
