C.S. HRITHWIK (PP) THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 05.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Peers 2024/KER/631 CRL.MC NO. 73 OF 2024 2 BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J eer eee ORDER Petitioner is indicted as the 9\" accused in Crime No.1371 of 2023 of Payyannur Police Station, Kannur, alleging offences punishable under Sections 406, 420, 120B r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. 2. Prosecution case is that petitioner herein, along with other accused, had availed a loan from the 3 respondent Company pursuant to a conspiracy to cause unlawful loss to the complainant and unlawful gain to the accused, cheated the complainant of a large amount of money, and thereby committed the offences alleged. 3. Sri.M.Sasindran, the learned counsel for the petitioner, submitted that there is absolutely no allegation against the petitioner so as to rope him as an accused. However, for reasons unknown to the petitioner, he has been falsely implicated as an accused in the crime. BURA Tal eomaae eee oer 2024/KER/631 CRL.MC NO. 73 OF 2024 3 4. Having heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the learned Public Prosecutor, I am of the view that the FIR in Crime No.1371/2023 was registered only on 02.11.2023 and_ the investigation is continuing. At this stage, it is not proper for this Court to interdict the investigation. Time and again, the courts have held that recourse to Section 482 to quash the FIR must be resorted to only in exceptional circumstances. 5. In the decision in State of Haryana and others v. Bhajan Lal and others (1992) Suppl 1 SCC 335, and Shambhu Kharwar v. State of Uttar Pradesh AIR 2022 SC 3901, the Supreme Court has held that the courts cannot enter into the merits of the allegations or trench upon the power of the investigating agency to investigate into allegations. In view of the above, I find no merit in this Crl.M.C., and the same is dismissed. sd/- BECHU KURIAN THOMAS JUDGE AMV/05/01/2024 Dera pec Ered nie ee Eee 2024/KER/631 CRL.MC NO. 73 OF 2024 4 APPENDIX OF CRL.MC 73/2024 PETITIONER ANNEXURES ANNEXURE ATI A TRUE COPY OF THE FIR IN CRIME NO.1371/2023 OF PAYYANNUR POLICE STATION, KANNUR DISTRICT ANNEXURE AIT A TRUE COPY OF THE APPLICATION FORM SUBMITTED BY THE PETITIONER TO THE 3RD RESPONDENT BANK (NO.MUALC98980) ANNEXURE AIII A TRUE COPY OF THE STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT OF THE PETITIONER IN THE HDFC BANK, FOR THE PERIOD FROM 01.05.2023 TO 31.10.2023 ANNEXURE AIV A TRUE COPY OF THE COMPLAINT DATED 13-11-2023 FILED BY THE PETITIONER WITH THE SUB INSPECTOR OF POLICE CHANDERA ANNEXURE AV A TRUE COPY OF THE RECEIPT DATED 13-11-2023 ISSUED BY THE S.H.0.CHANDERA ACKNOWLEDGING THE ANNEXURE AIV COMPLAINT ANNEXURE AVI A TRUE COPY OF THE APPLICATION SUBMITTED BY THE PETITIONER FOR VISA FOR LONG STAY IN BELGIUM TRUE COPY"
