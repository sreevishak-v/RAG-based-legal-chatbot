CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 04.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Crl1.MC.No.7200 OF 2017 2 202 1/KER ORDER A temporary gate installed obstructing the way claimed by the accused was removed by him without causing any destruction to the property. It is alleged that it was removed violating the interim order of injunction granted by a civil court. A removal of obstructing structure over a way claimed by the accused may not always constitute a criminal offence, unless the same is coupled with any kind of destruction. Violation of the interim order of injunction, if any should be addressed under Order 39 Rule 2 A C.P.C. Hence the crime registered on the allegation of Section 447 and 427 IPC based on a civil dispute cannot be sustained. Hence the same is quashed. Crl1l.M.C. is allowed accordingly. Sd/- P.
