Thankuttan residing at Thiruvathira Bhavan Thrippadapuram Kulathoor P.O Thiruvananthapuram 2. Vishnu residing at Thiruvathira Bhavan Thrippadapuram Kulathoor P.O Thiruvananthapuram By Advocates:- M Anil Prasad Counter Petitioners :- 1) Station House Officer Kazhakuttom Police Station 2) State of Kerala By Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumari This Criminal M.C. is coming on for hearing on 04.03.2025 and the court on 05.03.2025 passed the following : ORDER This is an application filed by accused Nos. 1 and 2 in the above crime under Section 483 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking regular bail. 2 2. The petitioners/ accused Nos. 1 and 2 are alleged to have committed the offences punishable under Sections 296(b), 115(2), 118(1) and 109(1), r/w Section 3(5) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. 3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- The 3\" accused and the defcto complainant are husband and wife. The friend of the defacto complainant sent some private photos and videos of the 3\" accused, while she was abroad, to the defacto complainant, which he forwarded to the wife of the 2 accused, and thereafter, the defacto complainant filed a divorce petition against the 3 accused. Due to that animosity, on 19.01.2025 at about 11.15 p.m., the 3 accused called the defacto complainant over phone to come to a place near the Library at Thrippadapuram Temple, and when the defacto complainant reached there, the 3 accused quarreled with him, and at that time, the 2\"! accused slapped on the left cheek of the defacto complainant, and the 1* accused abused and threatened him, and by using a chopper, hacked him on his left hip, causing an injury, and the 2\" accused exhorted to kill him. Thereafter, accused Nos. 2 and 3 restrained the defacto complainant and the 1* accused hacked him above the left hip, causing a deep injury. 4. Reportedly, the 1* petitioner / 1 accused was arrested on 27.01.2025 and the 2 petitioner / 2\" accused was arrested on 20.01.2025 and they are in judicial custody since then. 3 5. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The Investigating Officer filed report opposing the bail application. 6. Heard. Perused the records. 7. The only point to be considered is, whether regular bail can be granted to the petitioners/ accused Nos. 1 and 2. 8. The Point:- The 1\" petitioner / 1\" accused is the father of the 2\" petitioner / 2 accused and the 3 accused. Allegedly, accused Nos. 1 and 2 had assaulted the defacto complainant, and the 1* accused had stabbed him, using a chopper. The marital problems between the defacto complainant and the 3\" accused is the motive of the alleged assault. 9. According to the petitioners, they are absolutely innocent of the allegations levelled against them and they were arrayed as accused on the basis of the allegations of the defacto complainant, solely to wreck vengeance against the petitioners due to personal and matrimonial disputes. It is submitted that, the 1* petitioner is the father-in-law and the 2 petitioner is the brother-in-law of the defacto complainant, and the 3 accused is the legally wedded wife of the defacto complainant, and when she questioned the illicit relationship of the defacto complainant with other women, their relationship got strained, and the defacto complainant demanded divorce from the 3 accused. It is also submitted that, thereafter, the defacto complainant used to visit her home and 4 started threatening her after consuming alcohol, and none of the accused met the defacto complainant on the alleged date of incident. 10. The magnitude of the offence alleged is grave. Apparently, there is marital dispute between the 3\" accused and the defacto complainant. It is seen from the First Information Statement given by the defacto complainant that both of them were living separately for the past three years and that a mutual divorce petition is pending before the court. Going by the First Information Statement, it is seen that the 3\" accused had called over phone the defacto complainant and asked him to come to a place to talk something and when he reached the said place, the petitioners/accused Nos. 1 and 2 also came to the spot and there was some altercation between the two, and consequently, the alleged assault occurred. It is stated that the defacto complainant had sustained deep injuries and he was taken to Medical College Hospital. The discharge summary of the defacto complainant/victim appended along with the report shows that, he had sustained severe injuries, including fracture to rib, incised wound over left lumbar region, and incised wound over left flank. So there are corresponding injuries. It is stated in the report that the chopper used for the commission of the offence was recovered. So, the prosecution has made out a prima facie case against the petitioners and regarding the involvement of the petitioners in the alleged offence. The investigation in this case is progressing. The 1 petitioner / 1\" accused is in custody only for a period of 37 days and the 2\" petitioner / 2\" 5 accused is in custody only for a period of 44 days. It is stated in the report that, the 1* petitioner is involved in eight other crimes and the 2\" petitioner is involved in two other crimes. So the criminal antecedents of the petitioners is noted. It is stated in the report that, the 3% accused is yet to be arrested and her mobile phone is to be recovered. So, if the petitioners are released on bail, it may hinder the arrest of the 3\" accused, and they are likely to influence or intimidate the defacto complainant and other witnesses and tamper with the evidence. So, the investigation will be adversely affected. The chance of absconding also cannot be ruled out. Considering the afore aspects, including the gravity of the offence, this court is not inclined to release the petitioners on bail at this stage. In the result, this petition is dismissed. Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and pronounced by me in Open Court on this the 5\" day of March, 2025. NAZEERA S.
