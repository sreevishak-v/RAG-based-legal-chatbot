No.571/2025 (Crime No.166/2025 of Balaramapuram Police Station) Petitioner/Accused :- Maheshkumar.T, aged 55 years, S/o Thankappan Nair, residing at Sivakripa, Anthiyoor, Pathiriyodu, Kottukal P.O, Balaramapuram, Thiruvananthapuram District By Advocates:-Mariapuram C. Sreekumar, Adharsh Sreekumar, Jijith.J and Akshay T.H Counter Petitioners/Respondents:- 1. Station House Officer, Balaramapuram Police Station 2. State of Kerala By Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumary This petition came up for hearing on 25/02/2025 and the court on 28/02/2025 passed the following : ORDER This is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail. 2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable under Sections 296(b), 126(2), 351(3), 118(1) and 110 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, and Crime No. 166/2025 of Balaramapuram Police Station is registered against the petitioner arraying him as the accused. Criminal M.C.No.571/2025 1/5 3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- On 04.02.2025 at about 7.40 a.m., while the defacto complainant was driving his autorickshaw along the Thembamuttom-Villikulam Road, and when the vehicle reached near Karathala Temple, the accused, who was riding a scooter along the said road, wrongfully restrained the defacto complainant, uttered abusive words against him, and thereafter, hacked him, using a knife, on his forehead, nose and right knee, causing injuries. 4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The Investigating Officer filed report opposing the anticipatory bail application. 5. Heard. Perused the records. 6. | The only point to be considered is, whether an order of anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioner/ accused. 7. The Point:- The petitioner/accused was running a stationery store, and the defacto complainant was a regular customer in that store. It is alleged that, in view of some dispute between the two, in relation to the accounts maintained in the stationery store regarding the purchase of provisions made by the defacto complainant, the petitioner/accused had assaulted the defacto complainant, using a knife. 8. According to the petitioner, he is absolutely innocent of the Criminal M.C.No.571/2025 2/5 allegations levelled against him and he has been falsely implicated in this case. It is submitted that, the petitioner is conducting a stationery store business, and the defacto complainant, who is a regular customer in his shop, used to purchase stationary items, on credit basis, and while so, on 03.02.2025, the defacto complainant misbehaved with the lady staff of the shop and abused her and when the petitioner questioned the same, on 04.02.2025, the defacto complainant, under the influence of alcohol, chased and attacked the petitioner while he was returning home, and he sustained injuries in the said incident and he took treatment from Family Health Centre, Balaramapuram. 9. There is serious allegation as against the petitioner. Going by the First Information Statement given by the defacto complainant, it is seen that, the defacto complainant had purchased some stationery goods from the shop of the accused and some amount was due from the defacto complainant, and later, he had paid some amount, and there was a dispute between the two in not entering the same, and thereafter, due to that animosity, the petitioner had attacked the defacto complainant while the defacto complainant was going in his autorickshaw. In the body note appended to the First Information Statement, it is stated that, the wound of the defacto complainant over his forehead, nose and right leg were seen dressed. The case of the petitioner is that, when the petitioner questioned the Criminal M.C.No.571/2025 3/5 misbehavior of the defacto complainant with the lady staff of his shop, the defacto complainant had, in fact, attacked the petitioner, and that the petitioner sustained injuries, and he was treated at Family Health Centre, Balaramapuram. Along with the bail application, he had produced a prescription slip from Family Health Centre, Balaramapuram. Apparently, there is some dispute between the two in view of the purchase of stationery from the shop of the petitioner. In view of the disparity between the two, an exaggeration of the case cannot be ruled out. No material is produced by the prosecution, apart from the First Information Report, to show that, the allegation against the petitioner carries some weight. It would be a travesty of justice, if the petitioner is put behind the bars, if actually he has not committed the offence. No criminal antecedents of the petitioner is brought to the notice of this court. 10. In view of my discussion above, it appears that there is no impediment in granting a pre-arrest bail to the petitioner. Considering all these aspects, it is found that this is a fit case where a pre-arrest bail can be granted to the petitioner. In the result, the petition is allowed on the following conditions:- (1) In the event of arrest, the petitioner/ accused shall be released on bail on his executing bond for Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) with two solvent sureties for the like sum Criminal M.C.No.571/2025 4/5 each to the satisfaction of the arresting officer/Investigating Officer, as the case may be. (2) Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer between 10 a.m. and 11 am. on every Wednesday for a period of 3 (three) months or till the filing of the final report, whichever is earlier. (3) Petitioner shall also appear before the Investigating Officer as and when required. (4) Petitioner shall not commit any offence while on bail. (5) Petitioner shall not attempt to contact the defacto complainant or any of the prosecution witnesses, directly or through any other person, or in any other way try to tamper with the evidence or influence any witnesses or other persons related to the investigation. In case of any violation of the above conditions or misuse of liberty, the prosecution or the defacto complainant is at liberty to approach jurisdictional court for cancellation of bail.
