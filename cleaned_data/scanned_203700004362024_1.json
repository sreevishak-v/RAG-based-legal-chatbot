CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 18.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Bee Bisa 2024/KER/4961 CRL.MC NO. 436 OF 2024 2 BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J. ~ GrLLM.C.No.436 of 2024 Dated this the 18\" day of January, 2024 ORDER Petitioner challenges the order dated 08.12.2023 in Crl.M.P.No.4085 of 2023 in C.C.No.991 of 2019 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrates Court, Ambalapuzha. According to the petitioner, an application filed under Section 311 of Cr.P.C. seeking to cross-examine PW2 was rejected by the learned Magistrate. The reason for filing such application was on account of the fact that petitioners counsel could not cross-examine the witness on the date fixed since the counsel was suffering from throat pain. 2. I have heard Sri.C.R.Sanish, the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as Sri.M.C.Ashi, the learned Public Prosecutor. 3. In the impugned order, the learned Magistrate has specifically mentioned the various dates to which the case was adjourned for cross- examination of the witness. However, on all those occasions, for some reason or the other, cross-examination was not carried out and on 25.08.2023, when the witness appeared for cross-examination, the counsel was not ready due to throat pain. The learned Magistrate after noticing that the application for adjournment did not specify the actual date on which the counsel was suffering from throat pain, refused to rely upon the said application and declined to recall the witness. Bee Bisa 2024/KER/4961 CRL.MC NO. 436 OF 2024 3 4. Ona consideration of the contentions advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the learned Public Prosecutor and on a perusal of the impugned order, this Court is of the opinion that even though the reasons given by the learned Magistrate cannot be found fault with considering the circumstance that PW2 has not been cross- examined, in order to enable a fair trial to be carried out, one more opportunity can be granted to the petitioner to cross-examine the witness. The inability to cross-examine a witness due to an illness of the counsel for a party cannot be a reason to recall a witness, as alternative measures ought to have been adopted by the party as well as the counsel, especially since repeated postings had been given by the learned Magistrate in the instant case. 5. However, adopting a lenient view, this Court sets aside the impugned order and direct the learned Magistrate to recall PW2 in C.C.No.991 of 2019 on a date convenient to the court as a last opportunity. If on the said date so fixed by the learned Magistrate, petitioner fails to cross-examine the witness, necessarily further such opportunities need not be granted. With the above observation, this Crl.M.C.is allowed setting aside the impugned order dated 08.12.2023.
