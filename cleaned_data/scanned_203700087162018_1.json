The petitioner seeks for quashing the proceedings in C.C. No.718 of 2001, on the ground that, the issue involved therein has been amicably settled among the defacto complainant and himself. On 19.12.2018, this Court had directed the petitioner to surrender before the court concerned, which has been in seizin of the same and to pay the amount covered by the bond executed by him, if he was released on bail by the investigating officer during investigation. This Court had also directed to grant him bail in the event of filing of an application by him seeking for the same, without insisting for sureties. 3. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that he had surrendered before the court and bail was granted to him. A memo is also submitted across the bar by the learned counsel for the petitioner, which was issued by Peal Crl.MC.No. 8716 of 2018 3 2019 1KERIIS? the Junior Superintendent of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Ottappalam dated 27.12.2018.

The learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the case has now been removed from the Long Pending Register and renumbered as C.C. No.1086 of 2018. According to the learned counsel, the matter has been settled among the defacto complainant and the petitioner and swearing to those aspects an affidavit has been filed by the defacto complainant. The affidavit is produced along with the petition as Annexure- III and it is stated therein that, the issues involved in the case have been amicably settled among the defacto complaint himself and the petitioner. Therefore, he has no objection in recording the case as settled and quashing the proceedings in Crime No.36 of 2001, which is pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Ottappalam now as C.C.No.1086 of 2018 (originally as C.C.No.718 of 2001).
