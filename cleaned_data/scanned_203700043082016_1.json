Dated this the 7\" day of December 2017 ORDER The petitioner seeks orders quashing the proceedings in CR 72/2016 of the Excise Range, Thiruvananthapuram. Due to the stay granted by this Court, investigation stands stalled. The petitioner's grievance is that the respondent has unnecessarily registered a crime under Section 55(i) of the Kerala Abkari Act (for short, the Act'), and if at all the facts are admitted, it is at the best only a violation of the licence conditions, punishable only under Section 56(b) of the Act. 2. The prosecution case is that some quantity of Indian Made Foreign Liquor was seen kept at the premises of the petitioner for illicit sale. Let the Investigating Officer make a thorough investigation, and conclude what exactly is the offence involved. Let it be thoroughly examined and concluded whether this is only a case of innocent possession of Indian Made Foreign Liquor within permitted limits, or whether there are materials to substantiate the allegations under Section 55(i) of the Act. Any way, let the investigation progress, and let a final report be ae Biseanee 2017/KER/49546 Crl.M.C. No.4308 of 2016 1 2i- filed by the Excise Inspector. If the petitioner is in any manner aggrieved by the final report, he can pursue appropriate remedies under the law. Thus, giving liberty to the petitioner to challenge the final report appropriately, in case it goes against him, or to his prejudice, or if he is so advised, this Crl.M.C. is disposed of. In the interest of justice, I direct the Investigating Officer to submit final report within three months, if possible. Sd/- P.UBAID JUDGE /[TRUE COPY// P.A. TO JUDGE Jvt/7.12.2017"
