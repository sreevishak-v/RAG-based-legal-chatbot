CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 22.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: 2024/KER/4665 CRL.MC_ 86/2024 2 BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J ee ee ORDER Petitioners are the accused in Crime No.589/2023 of Palode Police Station, alleging offences punishable under Sections 3, 25(IB)(a) of the Arms Act, 1959, apart from 8(1) and (2) of the Abkari Act, 1967. 2. While granting bail to the petitioners in Crl.M.C.982/2023, the learned Sessions Judge imposed certain conditions. Thereafter, petitioners approached this Court in Crl.M.C.No.4965/2023 seeking modification of the conditions imposed and by order dated 03.07.2023, this Court modified the conditions and directed that petitioners obtain permission from the Jurisdictional Court, if they intent to go abroad. 3. However, when petitioners approached the learned Magistrate seeking permission to travel abroad that petition was dismissed, pointing out that the Magistrate court lacked Pe BSR aat 2024/KER/4665 CRL.MC 86/2024 3 jurisdiction. Subsequently, petitioners once again approached this Court through Crl.M.C.No.6057/2023 and by order dated 04.08.2023, it was held that the Magistrate was not justified in dismissing the application, as the final report had not yet been laid. 4. Pursuant to the above judgment, petitioners filed Crl.M.P.No.4243/23 seeking permission to travel abroad. However, by the impugned order dated 08.08.2023, permission was granted to go abroad only for a period of six months. 5. Sri.A.Rajasimhan, the learned counsel for the petitioners, contended that the order granting permission to travel abroad only for six months causes serious prejudice to the petitioner as they had already been employed abroad even at the time of registration of the crime. It was submitted that permission ought to be granted for a minimum period of five years to reside abroad. 6. Sri.Noushad K.A., the learned Public Prosecutor, on the other hand, submitted that pursuant to the impugned order, Pe BSR aat 2024/KER/4665 CRL.MC 86/2024 4 petitioners have already traveled abroad and that no prejudice would be caused to them as they can appear and seek extension of the period stipulated, especially since the final report is about to be filed before the Court. 7. A perusal of the impugned order reveals that the court has already granted permission to the petitioners to go abroad, as they have been employed in Qatar for the last 12 years. Conditions have been imposed that petitioners should appear before the court as and when required. Since the said conditions are sufficient for the time being to ensure that the petitioners will appear before the court, I am of the view that, taking into reckoning employment of the petitioners in Qatar, the permission for six months is too meagre and can cause prejudice. Considering the entire circumstances, permission for two years would be a reasonable period. 8. In the above circumstances, a period of six months granted to the petitioners to go abroad shall stand modified to two years from 08.08.2023. 9. It is made clear that all other conditions imposed by the reo) Epes apt 2024/KER/4665 CRL.MC 86/2024 5 learned Magistrate shall continue. Any further extension of time can be sought for, from the jurisdictional court in accordance with law. The Crl.M.C.is disposed of. sd/- BECHU KURIAN THOMAS JUDGE AMV/22/01/2024 pe ct Be et 2024/KER/4665 CRL.MC 86/2024 6 APPENDIX OF CRL.MC 86/2024 PETITIONER ANNEXURES ANNEXURE At TRUE COPY OF THE FIR NO. 589 OF 2023 OF PALODE POLICE STATION ANNEXURE A2 TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER IN CRLMC NO. 982 OF 2023 OF SESSIONS COURT, THIRUVANANTHAPURAM DATED 29-4-2023 ANNEXURE A3 TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER IN CRLMC NO. 984 OF 2023 OF SESSIONS COURT, THIRUVANANTHAPURAM DATED 29-4-2023 ANNEXURE A4 TRUE COPY OF THE INDIAN PASSPORT OF THE 1ST PETITIONER BEARING NO. $1211698 ANNEXURE A5 TRUE COPY OF THE 1ST PETITIONER'S RESIDENCY PERMIT ISSUED BY THE STATE OF QATAR ANNEXURE A6 TRUE COPY OF THE 1ST PETITIONER'S DIGITALLY ATTESTED ELECTRONIC LABOR CONTRACT DATED 29-1-2022 ANNEXURE A7 TRUE COPY OF THE LETTER DATED 9-5-2023 ISSUED BY THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE 1ST PETITIONER'S COMPANY ANNEXURE A8 TRUE COPY OF THE RESIDENCY PERMIT OF 1ST PETITIONER'S WIFE NEERAJA VISHNU ISSUED BY THE STATE OF QATAR ANNEXURE AQ TRUE COPY OF THE RESIDENCY PERMIT OF 1ST PETITIONER'S ELDER DAUGHTER SAHASRA VISHNU NEERAJA ISSUED BY THE STATE OF QATAR ANNEXURE A10 TRUE COPY OF THE RESIDENCY PERMIT OF THE 1ST PETITIONER'S YOUNGER DAUGHTER SANIDHYA VISHNU NEERAJA ISSUED BY THE STATE OF QATAR ANNEXURE A114 TRUE COPY OF THE INDIAN PASSPORT OF THE 2ND PETITIONER BEARING NO. $7249211 ANNEXURE A1i2 TRUE COPY OF THE 2ND' PETITIONER'S RESIDENCY PERMIT ISSUED BY THE STATE OF QATAR ANNEXURE A13 TRUE COPY OF THE 2ND PETITIONER'S DIGITALLY ATTESTED ELECTRONIC LABOR CONTRACT DATED 2-4-2023 ANNEXURE A14 TRUE COPY OF THE LETTER DATED 9-5-2023 THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE 2ND ie Be aes oH 2024/KER/4665 CRL.MC 86/2024 7 PETITIONER'S COMPANY ANNEXURE A15 TRUE COPY OF THE COMMON ORDER DATED 3-7-2023 IN CRLMC NO. 4964/2023 AND 4965/2023 OF THIS HON'BLE COURT ANNEXURE A16 TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER DATED 26-7-2023 IN CRLMP NO. 4243 OF 2023 OF THE JUDICIAL FIRST CLASS MAGISTRATE COURT FOR THE TRIAL OF FOREST OFFENCES, NEDUMANGAD ANNEXURE A117 TRUE COPY OF THE COMMON ORDER DATED 4-8-2023 IN CRLMC NO. 6057 OF 2023 AND 6049 OF 2023 OF THIS HON'BLE COURT ANNEXURE A118 TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER DATED 8-8-2023 IN CRLMP NO. 4243 OF 2023 OF THE JUDICIAL FIRST CLASS MAGISTRATE COURT FOR THE TRIAL OF FOREST OFFENCES, NEDUMANGAD TRUE COPY"
