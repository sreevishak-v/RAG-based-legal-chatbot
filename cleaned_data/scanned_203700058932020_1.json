Petitioners are the accused Nos.1 to 5 in Crime No.1175 of 2020 of Quilandy Police Station registered for the offences punishable under Sections 406, 498(A)and 34 of Indian Penal Code. 3. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners have submitted that the first petitioner, who is the first accused has married the defacto complainant and they resided together as husband and wife for sometime. But due to the difference of opinion, they separated and subsequently their marriage has been dissolved by a decree of divorce by the Family Court, Vadakara in O.P.No.482 of 2020. 4.

Therefore, it is quite unnecessary to proceed with the case registered against the petitioners on some misunderstanding by the defacto complainant. 5. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners, respondent as well the learned Public Prosecutor. 6. The learned Public Prosecutor has also submitted that the entire dispute between the parties have been amicably settled and as such the defacto complainant has no grievance or complaints against these petitioners. 7. On going through the- entire records produced by the petitioners as well on hearing both sides, I find that no fruitful purpose is likely to be served by pursuing the matter against these petitioners. Moreover, no public interest is involved in the case and there is no _ legal impediment in granting the prayer as sought for by the petitioners. As, the entire dispute has been Bera Se es E Cr1.MC.No.5893 OF 2020 2021/KER/368 5 amicably settled the request to quash the FIR registered against these petitioners can be allowed as prayed for by the petitioners.
