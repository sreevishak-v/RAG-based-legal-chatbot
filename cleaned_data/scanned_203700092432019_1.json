PUBLIC PROSECUTOR THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 09.01.2020, ALONG WITH Crl.MC.9243/2019(E), THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: ae Crl.M.Cs 9243/2019 & 9244/2019 ; 2020/KER/LIS4 COMMON ORDERS (Crl.M.C.s 9243 of 2019 & 9244 of 2019) Dated this the 9th day of January, 2020 The petitioner is aggrieved by the dismissal of this application under Section 451 Cr.P.C for release of a sum of Rs.21,25,000/-(Rupees Twenty one lakh Twenty five thousand only) and Rs.5,43,000/- (Rupees Five lakh forty three thousand only) respectively seized by the Investigating Officer in Crime No.877 of 2019 of Adimaly Police Station. The petitioner is the defacto complainant in a complaint alleging offence under Section 395 IPC. The petitioner filed an application before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Adimaly for release of the amount. But the application was rejected on the ground that considering the nature of the offence and the fact that it has exclusively triable by the Court of Sessions, and that Income Tax Authorities have been intimidate regarding the seizure and therefore, clearance from the department has also to be obtained, and hence the amount could not be released to the petitioner. By sik el i a oe Crl.M.Cs 9243/2019 & 9244/2019 2020/KER/LIS4 4 2. The reasons stated by the learned Magistrate for not releasing the amount to the petitioner appears to be reasonable. But however, being such a huge amount it is always appropriate that it may be deposited in the fixed deposit earning interest, and therefore the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Adimaly, is directed to deposit the amount in an interest bearing deposit in a nationalised bank. Crl.M.Cs are disposed of as above.
