CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 19.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: er 2024/KER/5276 CRL.MC NO. 43 OF 2024 3 BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J. ~ CrLM.C.No.43 of 2024 Dated this the 19\" day of January, 2024 ORDER Petitioners have invoked the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C to quash all proceedings against them. 2. Petitioners are accused 1 to 3 in Crime No.1064 of 2023 of Mannancherry Police Station, Alappuzha, registered for the offences under Sections 294(b), 341, 323, 324, 394 and 506 r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The 2\" respondent is the defacto complainant. 3. According to the prosecution, on 11.11.2023, the accused had assaulted the defacto complainant and took away an amount of Rs.7,500/- and food packets from the defacto complainant after abusing him and thereby committed the offences alleged. 4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned counsel for the respondent, apart from the learned Public Prosecutor. 5. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the matter has been settled and hence the proceedings against the petitioners ought to be quashed. It was also submitted that, considering the nature of offences alleged, no purpose would be served by continuing the proceedings. 6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and Another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], the Apex Court has held that in appropriate cases, the High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. This view was reiterated in Elz ae 2024/KER/5276 CRL.MC NO. 43 OF 2024 4 Narinder Singh and Others v. State of Punjab and Another [(2014) 6 SCC 466] and Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State of Jharkhand and Another [(2014) 9 SCC 653]. 7. I have perused Annexure-A2 affidavit filed by the 2\"? respondent. The learned Public Prosecutor has submitted that upon verification, it is understood that the affidavit is genuine, and the defacto complainant stands by the contents thereof. I am satisfied that the matter has been settled and no public interest is involved in this case. There is no impediment for granting the prayer for quashing. The continuance of the proceedings will only be an exercise in futility. 8. Accordingly, all proceedings against the _ petitioners in Crime No.1064 of 2023 of Mannancherry Police Station, Alappuzha are quashed. This Crl.M.C is allowed as above.
