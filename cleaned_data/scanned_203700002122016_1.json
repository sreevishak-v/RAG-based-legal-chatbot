What is under challenge is the validity of the analysis report of the food involved in C.C. No.567/2011 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-l, Aluva. 3. Relying on the decision reported in Pepsico India Holdings Pvt. Ltd. v. Food Inspector and another[2010 (4) KLT 706 (SC)j, this Court in Gopalakrishnan v. Food Inspector[2013 (3) KLT 455] had held that the provisions under Section 23(1A)(ee) and (hh) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act are mandatory and the same are applicable to all the food items. Bl ts [a] 2018/KER/700 CRL.M.C.No. 212 of 2016 aoe 4. The question involved in this case is the non compliance of the mandatory provisions contained under Section 23(1A)(ee) and (hh) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act. As there was a divergent view in the matter, the decision in Gopalakrishnan(supra) along with the other decisions of the learned Single Judges were referred to the Division Bench. The Division Bench of this Court in Crl.R.P. No.1814/2002 considered the said question and has disposed of the matter through order dated 17.11.2015, thereby upholding the view taken by this Court in Gopalakrishnan(supra). 5. Matters being so, the continued prosecution of the petitioners in C.C. No.567/2011 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-l, Aluva, are illegal and no purpose would be served in proceeding with the matter any further. The matters involved in the said case are quite unnecessary in view of the decisions noted supra and, therefore, the same are liable to be quashed. BES h 4 a 2018/KER/700 CRL.M.C.No. 212 of 2016 -30- In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure A complaint and all further proceedings initiated against the petitioners in C.C. No.567/2011 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-l, Aluva, are hereby quashed. Sd/- B. KEMAL PASHA, JUDGE. ul/- [True copy] P.S. to Judge."
