TO JUDGE bp Bleed 2016/KER/33670 RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.Y, J Dated this the 1* day of August, 2016 ORDER 1.A complaint was filed by the Food Inspector, Thalassery against the petitioner and two _ others alleging commission of offence punishable under sections 16(1)(a)(i) read with section 7(1) and 2(1)(a) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954. The petitioner is the owner of a grocery shop of which the 1st accused in the said complaint was a salesman. 2.The prosecution allegation is that the Food Inspector had purchased 450 grams of coffee, which when sent to the public analyst, was found adulterated. The 34 accused in the aforesaid complaint was_ the manufacturer of the food item. The case was Bleed 2016/KER/33670 Crl.M.C.4855/2016 2 proceeded with and by Annexure-A judgment dated 11.10.1985, the learned Magistrate had extended the benefit of doubt to the manufacturer and convicted the 1st accused, who was the salesman of the shop. The petitioner was not available for trial. The case against him was split up and refilled. 3.Challenging the finding of guilt, the ist accused salesman had preferred an appeal before the learned Sessions Judge as Crl.Appeal No.290 of 1985. As per judgment dated 31.3.1990, the said appeal was dismissed and the findings of the learned Magistrate was confirmed. Against the above finding, the 1: accused had approached this Court by ffiling Crl.Revision Petition No.386 of 1990. As per judgment dated 18.9.1992, this Court held that the salesman was entitled to the benefit of warranty and acquitted the said accused. The said judgment has become Bleed 2016/KER/33670 Crl.M.C.4855/2016 3 final. 4.It is submitted by the learned counsel that the petitioner, who is arrayed as the 24 accused, was out of country in connection with his employment. The case against him was initially split up and re-filed as 276 of 1985. Thereafter it was transferred to the long pending register and it is presently numbered as L.P.C. No.86 of 2001. According to the learned counsel in view of Annexure-B judgment of this Court, acquitting the salesman of the shop, the proceedings against the petitioner herein, who is the owner of the grocery shop is nothing but an empty formality. It is further pointed out that no purpose will be served by directing the petitioner to undergo the ordeal of trial. 5.The learned counsel would also submit relying on the ratio of the judgment of the Apex Court in Pepsico India Holdings Pvt. Ltd. v. Food Inspector and another meena 2016/KER/33670 Crl.M.C.4855/2016 4 [2010 (4) KLT 706 (SC)] and that of a Division Bench of this Court in Rasheed N.K. W Food Inspector, Thalasserry (2016 (1) KLD 704) to contend that Section 23(1A)(ee) and (hh) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act are mandatory, and any prosecution instituted under the Act, in violation of the said provisions cannot be sustained. It is forcefully urged that method of analysis is not a validated one as prescribed under S.23 (1A)(hh) and the laboratory where the analysis was conducted was not a defined one for such examination under S.23(1A)(ee) of the Act. 6.Heard the submissions of the learned counsel as well as the Public Prosecutor. 7.1t is discernible from Annexure-B judgment that the ist accused who was the salesman of the said shop room was granted the benefit of warranty and was acquitted by this Court. The petitioner being the owner of the meena 2016/KER/33670 Crl.M.C.4855/2016 5 grocery shop is entitled to avail the benefit of the said finding as well. 8.More over, the Division Bench in Rasheed N.K. ( Supra), after interpreting the various provisions of the PFA Act , 1957, in line with the pronouncement of the Apex Court in Pepsico Case (Supra), has held that in order for the Analyst report to become the basis for launching a prosecution, the analysis of the food has to be conducted in a laboratory defined under S.23(1A)(ee) of the Act. In the case on hand the report is dated 10.2.1983 which in other words means that the laboratory where the analysis was conducted could not have been a defined lab. If that be the case the taking of cognizance on the basis of the said report cannot be sustained. In the above facts and circumstances, I am of the view that the continuation of proceedings as against the petitioner is nothing but an abuse of the process of law. Benesteta] 2016/KER/33670 Crl.M.C.4855/2016 6 Accordingly, this petition is allowed. All further proceedings against the petitioner in L.P.C.No.86 of 2001 on the file of the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Thalassery, will stand quashed. Sd/- RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.Y.
