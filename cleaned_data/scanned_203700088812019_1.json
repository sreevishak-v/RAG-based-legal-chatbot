BY ADV. SRI.T.RAJESH SRI.C.S.HRITHWIK SR PP THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 09.01.2020, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: oy 2020/KER/1122 Crl.MC.No.8881 OF 2019 (A) 2 ORDER Dated this the 9th day of January 2020 The petitioners are aggrieved by the impugned order of the Special Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ernakulam, at Annexure B, wherein exercising jurisdiction under Section 14 of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (herein after referred to as \"the Act') on petition filed by the secured creditor the respondent herein, appointing Paul Varghese as Commissioner to take delivery of the secured assets scheduled with the petition. 2. The petitioners are aggrieved for the reason that Section 14 of the Act does not empower the Chief Judicial Magistrate to appoint an Advocate Commissioner to take possession of the secured assets. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners reads out IR] ops 4 Te 2020/KER/1122 Crl.MC.No.8881 OF 2019 (A) 3 Section 14(1) 3*4 proviso, wherein it is stated that, the District Magistrate or the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate may authorize any officer subordinate to him take possession of such assets and documents relating thereto. 3. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that, an Advocate cannot be appointed as a Commissioner since the Advocate is not an officer subordinate to the Magistrate. 4. The learned counsel appearing for the respondent drew the attention of this Court to the decision Muhammed Ashraf v. Union of India 2008(4) KLT 1, wherein, the Division Bench of this Court has held thus; With regard to the argument that a Commissioner cannot be appointed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate as part of giving assistance in taking possession of the secured assets while rendering assistance to the secured creditor to get possession of the secured assets, we are of the view that it is not necessary Pigs el ops i Te 2020/KER/1122 Cr1.MC.No.8881 OF 2019 (A) 4 that the District Magistrate or the Chief Judicial Magistrate should go personally and take possession. S.14(2) of the Securitisation Act provides that the Magistrate can order even police assistance and use all necessary powers in taking possession of the secured assets. The Division Bench relied on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sakiri Vasu _v. State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors. (2008 (1) KLT 724 (SC). 5. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that what the Division Bench is ordered, is that a Commission can be issued but an Advocate Commission cannot be issued, because an Advocate is not subordinate to the Magistrate. 6. A reading of the Section clearly indicates that, the Magistrate is authorized to = Bien 2020/KER/1122 Crl.MC.No.8881 OF 2019 (A) 5 appoint an officer subordinate to him to take possession of the secured property. When an Advocate is appointed as a Commissioner, he becomes an officer of the court and subordinate to the Magistrate. A reading of the Section and the precedent on the point would very clearly indicate that, the Magistrate has power to appoint a commissioner, and definitely an Advocate as a Commissioner for identification of the secured assets and taking possession of the secured assets. The objection raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner is puerile and therefore sustainable. The Crl.M.C is therefore dismissed.
