This case is instituted upon the Final Report filed by the Sub Inspector of Police, Sreekaryam Police Station in Crime No. 52/2023 for the offences punishable under Sections 294(b), 323, 341 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred to as the IPC). 2. The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: Due to the prior animosity towards the Informant, the Accused persons in furtherance of their common intention, wrongfully restrained the Informant inside St. Pauls Lutheran church, Gandhipuram at 9.30 am on 14.01.2023, uttered obscene words to him and voluntarily caused hurt to the Informant. Thereby the Accused are alleged to have committed offences punishable under Sections 294(b), 323, 341 r/w 34 of the IPC. 3. The cognizance was taken on the basis of Final Report in respect of the aforesaid offences. On issuance of process, the Accused entered appearance before this Court. They were enlarged on bail. They were represented by a Counsel of their own choice. Copies of all relevant Prosecution records were furnished to them. After hearing both parties and on perusing relevant records, the particulars 3 of the offences punishable under Sections 294(b), 323, 341 r/w 34 of IPC was read over and explained to them, to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. 4. From the side of Prosecution CW1 alone was examined as PW1 and Exhibit P1 was marked. The remaining witnesses were given up by the Learned APP as the material witness, the injured himself had turned hostile to the case of Prosecution. Since no incriminating circumstances arose from the deposition of the witness and materials on record, the examination of the Accused under Section 313(1)(b) of the CrPC was dispensed with. No Defence evidence was also adduced. 5. Heard both sides and perused the documents. The following points arise for consideration: (a) Have the Accused persons, in furtherance of their common intention, uttered obscene words to PW1 and thereby committed the offence punishable under section 294 (b) r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged? (b) Have the Accused persons, in furtherance of their common intention, voluntarily caused hurt to PW1 and thereby committed offence punishable under Section 323 r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged? (c) Have the Accused persons, in furtherance of their common intention, wrongfully restrained PWI1 and thereby committed offence punishable under Section 341 r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged? (d) If so, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded? 6. Points (a) to (c): These points are considered together for the sake of brevity and for avoiding repetition. PW1 deposed that the incident occurred 14.01.2023 at 9.30 at St. Pauls Lutheran church, Gandhipuram. He was restrained and assaulted by few persons on his way to the Church. They pushed and punched him. He did not sustain 4 serious injuries. He had gone for treatment initially to the Health Centre and thereafter to the Medical College. He deposed that he gave Exhibit P1 Statement to the police. He categorically denied the Accused having assaulted, restrained him, or uttered obscene words to him. On specific question put forth by the Learned APP, he deposed that the Accused are the relatives of his wife and that they have settled the matter between them and accordingly filed a Compounding Petition before this Court. On perusal of the evidence led by the Prosecution and the materials on record, it is clear from the testimony of PW1 that there is no evidence to support the Prosecution case. PW1 admits having sustained injuries but there is no whisper that that it was the Accused persons who had allegedly assaulted and restrained him or showered obscene words on him. In the aforesaid circumstances, the remaining witness was given up by the Prosecution as no purpose would be served in examining them. Neither the ingredients of the alleged offences, nor the involvement of the Accused persons brought out in the evidence adduced by the Prosecution. Furthermore, the as is evident from the deposition of PW1, the parties on account of their settlement had filed Compounding Petition as CMP 3984/2024, and the same was dismissed by this Court as alleged offences included commission of non-compoundable offence. Thus, this Court is of the view that the Prosecution has miserably failed to prove the involvement of this Accused persons in the above Crime beyond reasonable doubt. This Court finds that the Prosecution has failed to prove the case against the Accused and therefore, Points (a) to (c) are found in favour of the Accused. 7. Point (d): In light of finding in the foregoing points, this point does not arise for consideration. 8. In the result, the 1, 2? and 3% Accused are found not guilty of having committed the offences punishable under Sections 294(b), 323, 341 r/w 34 of the 5 IPC. They are acquitted of the aforesaid offences under Section 255(1) of the CrPC. Their bail bond stands cancelled and they are set at liberty.
