It is unnecessary to go into the facts and details of the case for the simple reason that the petitioner has impleaded the defacto complaint/victim as _ the first respondent who has entered appearance through a counsel and the learned counsel appearing for the second respondent has accepted that the affidavit filed along with this petition is one sworn to by the first respondent herself Bh Ents ape 2014/KER/235 CrI.M.C. No.70/2014 -2- and she stands by the statements contained therein. 4. On going through the said affidavit, it is seen that the parties have settled all their differences and issues between them and no further grievance remains to be redressed. It is also pointed out in the affidavit that the defacto complainant is not interested in prosecuting the matter further. 5. In the light of the stand taken by the defacto complainant, it is felt that continuance of the proceedings will only be an exercise in futility. Hence, this petition is allowed. All further proceedings in C.C. 1977 of 2013 pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-l, Kasaragod including the final report based on which cognizance was taken shall stand quashed and the petitioner shall stand discharged.
