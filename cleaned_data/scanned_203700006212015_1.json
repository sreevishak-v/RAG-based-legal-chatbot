Dated this the 5% day of May, 2015 ORDER The petitioner seeks orders quashing the F.I.R and further proceedings in Crime No.374/2014 of the Upputhara Police Station, Idukki registered under Sections 452, 354(A)(1), 354(A)(2) and 354(B) of the Indian Penal Code on the complaint of one Sumi. Orders are sought on the ground of amicable settlement of the whole dispute between the accused and the de facto complainant out of court. The de facto complainant Sumi is the 2? respondent in this proceeding brought under Section 482. of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He has filed affidavit to the effect that he has settled the whole dispute with the accused and he has no grievance or complaint 2. In so many decisions, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that even in cases involving non-compoundable offences, the High Court can quash the prosecution; be it at the crime stage or at the trial stage or even at the appellate or revisional stage; if the parties have really settled the whole dispute, or if continuance of the prosecution will not serve any Pieper) 2015/KER/17571 Crl.M.C No.621 of 2015 2 purpose. Here, IJ find a real case of settlement between the parties, and I also find that continuance of prosecution in such a situation will not serve any purpose other than wasting the precious time of the court, when the case ultimately comes before the court. In the result, this petition is allowed. The F.I.R and further proceedings in crime No.374/2014 of the Upputhara Police Station, Idukki will stand quashed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. P.UBAID JUDGE ab"
