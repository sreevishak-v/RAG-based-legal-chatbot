    "full_text": "IN THE COURT OF THE SESSIONS JUDGE, THIRUVANANTHAPURAM PRESENT : SMT. NAZEERA. S, SESSIONS JUDGE Tuesday, the 4\" day of March, 2025/ 13\" day of Phalguna, 1946 CRIMINAL M.C. No.620/2025 (Crime No.127/2025 of Vattiyoorkkavu Police Station) Petitioner/Accused_No.3:- Siva K.S, aged 19 years, S/o Krishna Swami, KPNRA 130, TC.10/2186, Kanjirampara P.O, Thiruvananthapuram 695030 By Advocate:-Nithin Santosh Respondent:- State of Kerala represented by the Sub Inspector of Police, Vattiyoorkavu Police Station By Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumary This petition came up for hearing on 03/03/2025 and the court on 04/03/2025 passed the following : ORDER This is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail. 2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable under Sections 126(2), 115(2), 117(2) and 118(2), r/w Section 3(5) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, and Crime No. 127/2025 of Vattiyoorkavu Police Station is registered against the petitioner arraying him as the 3 accused. Criminal M.C.No.620/2025 1/5 3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- On 07.02.2025 at about 9.45 p.m., inside Surendra Bar, situated at Manchadimoodu, Vattiyoorkavu, a wordy altercation occurred between the husband of the defacto complainant and accused Nos.1 and 2, and thereafter, accused Nos.1 and 2 fisted and beat on the face of the victim, pulled him down and kicked him repeatedly. When the victim went out of the Bar, accused Nos.1 and 2 along with the 3 accused wrongfully restrained him, and at that time, the 1* accused fisted on the face of the victim repeatedly, using an iron bangle, causing fracture to his nasal bone. When the victim fell down, accused Nos. 2 to 6 beat, fisted and kicked on various parts of his body. 4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The Investigating Officer filed report opposing the pre-arrest bail application. 5. Heard. Perused the records. 6. The only point to be considered is, whether pre-arrest bail can be granted to the petitioner/ 3 accused. 7. The Point:- The defacto complainant is the wife of the victim. The petitioner/ 3 accused along with the other accused are alleged to have attacked the victim, and the petitioner / 3\" accused had restrained the victim to help the 1* accused to attack him, using an iron bangle, causing injuries, and the petitioner Criminal M.C.No.620/2025 2/5 had beaten, fisted and kicked the victim. The alleged incident has happened inside and outside a Bar, and the motive for the incident is the enmity that arose, when a wordy altercation occurred between the victim and the accused persons. 8. According to the petitioner, he is innocent of the allegations levelled against him. It is submitted by the petitioner that, he is the friend of the 1* accused, and on 07.02.2025, while the petitioner along with his friends were taking food in front of Surendra Bar, they saw a scuffle in front of the Bar, assaulting the husband of the defacto complainant by the 1* and 2\" accused in the crime. It is also submitted that, when the local people gathered there, the assailants moved away from there, and thereafter, the 1* accused falsely implicated the petitioner in the present crime. 9. There is serious allegation as against the petitioner. It is seen from the report filed by the Investigating Officer that, the petitioner/ 3\"! accused had restrained the victim and aided 1* accused to hit on the face of the victim, using an iron bangle, causing serious injuries, and he along with the other accused had beaten, fisted and kicked the victim. In the accident register-cum-wound certificate appended with the report filed by the Investigating Officer, it is seen that, the victim sustained comminuted fracture of frontal process of maxilla, displaced fracture of right nasal bone and undisplaced fracture of left nasal bone. Criminal M.C.No.620/2025 3/5 It is stated in the report that the wound certificate and the treatment certificate of the victim were obtained. It is also stated in the report that the recovery of the weapon used for the commission of the offence is to be effected. It is reported that the petitioner is implicated in this crime on verification of CCTV footage. So, the prosecution has made out a prima facie case against the petitioner/ 3 accused and regarding the involvement of the petitioner in the alleged offence. The investigation is progressing. It is stated in the report that the petitioner is involved in two other crimes. Considering the facts stated in the report to the effect that the petitioner is involved in the offence, it appears that exceptional jurisdiction to grant a pre-arrest bail cannot be exercised in this case. 10. In Jai Prakash Singh v. State of Bihar and Another (2012 (4) SCC 379), the Honble Apex court has held that, an order of pre-arrest bail being an extra ordinary privilege, should be granted only in exceptional cases. It is settled in law that arrest should be the last option and it should be restricted to cases where arrest is imperative in the facts and circumstances of a case and consistent view is that the grant of anticipatory bail shall be restricted to exceptional circumstances. So it is clear that the power to grant anticipatory bail under section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita is an exceptional power and should be exercised only in exceptional cases and not as a matter of course. Its object is to Criminal M.C.No.620/2025 4/5 ensure that a person should not be harassed or humiliated in order to satisfy the grudge or personal vendetta of the complainant. [Reliance placed on the decision rendered by the Honble Apex Court in HDFC Bank Limited v. J.J. Mannan and Another (2010 (1) SCC 679); Srikant Upadhyay v. State of Bihar (2024 KHC Online 6137)]. In the case at hand, I find no exceptional circumstance to exercise the exceptional power of granting anticipatory bail. 11. Considering the serious allegation against the petitioner and gravity of the offence, it appears that granting the petitioner with an order of anticipatory bail will adversely affect the investigation. If an order of anticipatory bail is granted he is likely to influence the witnesses and tamper with the evidence. Considering all these aspects, this court is not inclined to grant an order of pre-arrest bail to the petitioner. In the result, this petition is dismissed. Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and pronounced by me in Open Court on this the 4\" day of March, 2025.
