Karthika S Varma Judicial I Class Magistrate-I, Thiruvananthapuram Monday, the 11\" day of November, 2024 Calendar Case No. 1032/2016 (Sreekaryam Police Station Crime 596/2016) Complainant State represented by the Sub Inspector, Sreekaryam Police station in Cr.No.596/2016 (By Smt.

The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: Due to that animosity towards the Informant not having given the Accused persons Rs. 500/- (Rupees Five Hundred Only) for consuming alcohol, the Accused persons, in furtherance of their common intention, on 10.05.2016 at about 6.00 pm at the road side near Kallampally Junction in Ulloor Village voluntarily caused hurt to the Informant. The 1* Accused uttered obscene words against the Informant hit on his left forehead and various parts of his body and kicked him down. The 2 Accused kicked on his back and punched on his chest. When the Informant attempted to run away from there, the Accused persons wrongfully restrained him and physically assaulted him. Thereby the Accused are alleged to have committed the above mentioned offences. 3 3. The cognizance was taken on the basis of Final Report in respect of the offences under Sections 294(b),341,323 r/w34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. On issuance of process, the Accused persons entered appearance. They were enlarged on bail. They were represented by a Counsel of their own choice. Copies of all relevant Prosecution records were furnished to them. After hearing both parties and on perusing relevant records, particulars of the offences under Sections 294(b),341,323 r/w34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 was read over and explained to them, to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. 4. From the side of Prosecution CW1 and CW7 was examined as PW1 and PW2 respectively and Exhibits P1 to P4 were marked and Exhibit P5 was marked subject to proof. The presence of CWs 2 to 4 could not be procured by the Prosecution, despite steps having been issued against them. The Learned Assistant Public Prosecutor gave up the CWs 5 and 6, as the Injured himself turned hostile to the Prosecution and Prosecution evidence was closed. Since no incriminating circumstances arose against the Accused persons from the deposition of the witnesses, their examination under Section 313 (1)(b) of the CrPC was dispensed with. No evidence was adduced from the side of the Defence. 5. Heard both sides and perused the documents. The following points arise for consideration. (a) Have the Accused Persons in furtherance of their common intention on uttered obscene words to PW1 and thereby committed offence punishable under Section 294(b) r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged? (b) Have the Accused Persons in furtherance of their common intention on the wrongfully restrained PW1 and thereby committed offence punishable under Section 341 r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged? 4 (c) Have the Accused Persons in furtherance of their common intention, on the voluntarily caused hurt to PW1 and thereby committed the offence punishable under section 323 r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged (d) If so, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded? 6. Points (a) to (c): These points are considered together for the sake of brevity and for avoiding repetition. PW1 denied having statement to police to the effect that he sustained injury in the incident and that he had gone to the hospital at the instance of the police officials alone. However, he admitted his signature in Exhibit P1 Statement. PW2 deposed that he was the Sation House Officer, Sreekaryam police station during the relevant period of time. He recorded statement of PW1. On the basis of Ext P1 FIS, he registered First Information Report for the offences under sections 294(b), 34, 323 and 34 of the IPC. Exhibit P1(a) is the body note of the PW1. Exhibit P2 is the Scene Mahazar prepared by him. Exhibits P3, P3(a) are the bail bonds of the Accused persons and. Exhibit P4 is the Address Report of the Accused persons. Exhibit P5 (subject to proof) is the Wound Certificate of PW1. He denied that deposition of PW1 that he had not given Exhibit P1 Statement. To the suggestion put by the Learned Counsel for the 1* Accused, PW2 admitted that the Accused persons were not made to be identified by the witnesses. I have carefully considered the evidence adduced by the Prosecution and the materials on record, as well as the submissions of the Learned APP and the Leaned Counsel for the Accused. Although there is body note of the Injured, wound certificate etc., it is pertinent to note that PW1, the injured is having no case that the Accused persons have assaulted him. PW1 even denied having given statement to the police. The 5 wound certificate cannot be considered as the same is not proved and the doctor who had examined PW1 has not appeared before this Court. The occurrence witness did not turn up before this Court and the Prosecution failed to procure their presence. Hence, remaining witnesses were given up by the Prosecution as no purpose would be served in examining them, when the Injured herself has no case supporting the Prosecution. The materials on record when considered in light of the deposition of PW1, cuts to the root of the Prosecution case as there is nothing to implicate the involvement of the Accused persons in the alleged crime. These points are thus answered in favour of the Accused persons. 8. Point (d): In light of finding in the foregoing points, this point does not arise for consideration. In the result, Accused Nos 1 and 2 are found not guilty of having committed the offences punishable under Sections 294(b),341,323 r/w34 of the IPC. They are acquitted of the aforesaid offences under Section 248(1) of the CrPC. Their bail bonds stand cancelled and they are set at liberty.
