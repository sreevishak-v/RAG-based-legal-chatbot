CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 04.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: op a 2024/KER/407 CRL.MC NO. 33 OF 2024 2 BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J. ~ CrLLM.C.No.33 of 2024 Dated this the 4\" day of January, 2024 ORDER Petitioner challenges Annexure Al order issued by the Sub Divisional Magistrate, Fort Kochi under Section 111 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short, 'the Cr.P.C.'). As per the impugned order, the learned Sub Divisional Magistrate recorded that he is prima facie convinced that the petitioner herein causes threat to the public peace and tranquility and security proceedings under Section 107 of the Cr.P.C. are liable to be initiated against him. 2. Sri.M.A.Ahammad Saheer, the learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently contended that the procedure carried out by the learned Sub Divisional Magistrate is wrong in law especially since except one case, all other cases referred to in Annexure Al have either been compounded or settled and therefore those cases cannot be relied upon to invoke proceedings under Section 107 of the Cr.P.C. or issue an order under Section 111 of the Cr.P.C. It is further submitted that the report of the Investigating Officer to the learned Sub Divisional Magistrate was on 12.03.2022 while the impugned order was issued only on 20.05.2023. 3. I have heard Sri.M.A.Ahammad Saheer, the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as Sri.C.S.Hrithwik, the learned Public Prosecutor. BREN: 2024/KER/407 CRL.MC NO. 33 OF 2024 3 4. The impugned order is issued under Section 111 of the Cr.P.C. The said order is only the beginning of an enquiry proceeding under Section 116 of the Cr.P.C. Petitioner will have all the opportunity to controvert the prima facie observations of the learned Sub Divisional Magistrate as recorded in Annexure Al in the enquiry proceedings. Further, it is noticed that the impugned order is issued on 20.05.2023 while this Crl.M.C.is filed after almost 7 months, though the petitioner has a case that the order was served on him only recently. 5. Be that as it may, as the order under Section 111 of the Cr.P.C. is subject to an enquiry proceedings to be carried out under Section 116 of the Cr.P.C., this Court is of the view that petitioner has sufficient remedy available under law to bring to the notice of the learned Magistrate the entire contention that he intends to take. 6. Since the petitioner has an effective opportunity as per the provisions of Section 116 of the Cr.P.C., there is no merit in this Crl.M.C. and the same is dismissed. The contentions raised by the petitioner in this Crl.M.C. are kept open to be raised before the learned Sub Divisional Magistrate during the enquiry proceedings.
