Criminal M.C.No. 650/2025 Crime No 89/2025 of Pothencode Police Station, Pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court -I Attingal Petitioner/Accused No. 1 :- Sreekumaran Nair aged 55 years S/o. Prabhakaran Pillai Kizhakkathil Puthan Veedu Ayirooppara Kattayikonam P.O Pothencode Thiruvananthapuram By Advocate:- VS Vineeth Kumar Counter Petitioner :- Station House Officer Pothencode Police Station By Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumari This Criminal M.C. is coming on for hearing on 03.03.2025 and the court on 04.03.2025 passed the following :: ORDER This is the 2 application filed by the sole accused in the above crime under Section 483 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking regular bail. 2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable under Sections 62 of 64(1), 74, 127(2) and 332(b) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. 3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- On 19.01.2025 at 5.30 p.m., the accused, trespassed into the rented apartment of the defacto complainant bearing door No. 614/1, situated at Kattayikonam in Ayirooppara 2 Village, and thereafter, locked the room, while the defacto complainant was inside the room. Thereafter, the accused grabbed the defacto complainant from behind, closed her mouth, fisted on her back and attempted to commit rape upon her. When the defacto complainant cried aloud, the neighbours came there, and at that time, the accused escaped from there. 4. Reportedly, the petitioner/accused was arrested on 20.01.2025 and he is in custody since then. 5. The earlier bail application filed by the petitioner was dismissed by this Court as per Order dated 14.02.2025 in Criminal M.C.No. 394/2025. 6. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The Investigating Officer filed report opposing the bail application. 7. Heard. Perused the records. 8. The only point to be considered is, whether regular bail can be granted to the petitioner/accused. 9. The Point:- The defacto complainant and the petitioner are totally strangers. As per the allegations, the petitioner/accused trespassed into the residence of the defacto complainant and attempted to commit rape upon her. 10. According to the petitioner, he is innocent of the allegations levelled against him and the registration of this crime is a corollary of strained relationship between the petitioner and the local leaders of ruling party. It is submitted that, while going through the First Information Statement given by 3 the defacto complainant, it is seen that the ingredients of the offences punishable u/ss. 74, 62 of 64, 127(2) and 332(b) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita are absent in this case. 11. The magnitude of the offence alleged is grave. However, it is seen from the report filed by the Investigating Officer that the CCTV footages were collected, the dresses worn by the accused were seized, the scene mahazar was prepared, and the statement of the victim under Section 183 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita was recorded. It is also stated in the report that the report of medico-legal examination of the victim was obtained. It appears that major part of the Investigation is over. The petitioner/ accused is in judicial custody for a period of 44 days. So even if the petitioner is released on bail, there is nothing much, which will adversely affect the investigation. No criminal antecedents of the petitioner is brought to the notice of this court. Considering all the afore aspects, I am of the view that, the petitioner/accused can be enlarged on bail subject to conditions. In the result, the petition is allowed and the petitioner/ accused is granted bail on the following conditions:- (1) Petitioner/accused shall execute bail bond for Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) with two solvent sureties for the like sum each to the satisfaction of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Attingal. 4 (2) Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer on every Monday between 10 a.m. and 12 noon for a period of 3 (three) months or till the final report is filed, whichever is earlier. (3) Petitioner shall not enter into the limits of the Police Station, where the victim resides, except for complying with the orders of this court, till the final report is filed. (4) Petitioner shall not commit any offence while on bail. (5) Petitioner shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade them from disclosing such facts to the court or to any police officer or tamper with evidence. (6) Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer as and when required by the Investigating Officer. (7) Petitioner shall fully co-operate with the investigation. In case of any violation of the above conditions or misuse of liberty, the prosecution or the defacto complainant is at liberty to approach jurisdictional court for cancellation of bail. Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and pronounced by me in Open Court on this the 4\" day of March, 2025. NAZEERA S.
