RESPONDENTS EXHIBITS NIL ff TRUE COPY // PA. TO JUDGE SD 2015/KER/786 P. UBAID, J. Dated this the 8\" day of January, 2015 ORDER The petitioners herein are the eight accused _ in S.C.No.131/2013 of the Court of Session, Kalpetta. Crime in this case was registered under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 294(b), 324, 427, 308 and 506 IPC read with Section 149 IPC, on the complaint of one Junaise, that the petitioners assaulted him and his friends Ajnas, Sainul Abid, Mujeeb Rahman and Muhammed Shafi, as part of a criminal design made by them, and inflicted injuries on their body with weapons with the knowledge of consequence that the injuries may cause death. The petitioners now seek orders quashing the prosecution, on the ground that they and the injured persons including the first informant have come to terms amicably out of court. The first informant, Junaise is the 2\" respondent herein, and the other persons who sustained injuries are the respondent Nos. 3 to 6. The respondents 2 to 6 have filed affidavit to the effect that they have settled the whole dispute with the accused, and they have 2015/KER/786 CrlM.C.. No. 91/2015 2 no grievance or complaint. I am well satisfied that there is a real and genuine settlement between the parties, and I also find that Section 308 IPC was in fact incorporated by the police on the basis of a purely hypothetical statement. This is a simple case of assault in which the respondents sustained some simple injuries. Any way, the dispute now stands settled. It is definite that continuance of prosecution will not serve any purpose in the above circumstances, because nobody will support the prosecution, if the case goes to trial. In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed. The prosecution in S.C.No.131/2013 of the Court of Session, Kalpetta as against the petitioners 2 to 8, and in C.P.No.3/2013 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Mananthavady as against the first petitioner herein, will stand quashed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. Accordingly, the petitioners will stand released from prosecution. The bail bond, if any, executed by them will stand discharged. Sd/- P. UBAID, JUDGE sd"
