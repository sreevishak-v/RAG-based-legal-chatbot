Criminal M.C.No. 612/2025 ( Crime No. 157/2025 of Medical College Police Station, pending before Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Thiruvananthapuram. ) Petitioner/Accused__:- Muhammad Yasin aged 23 years S/o. Maheen, TC 68/2622(1) Neelattinkara (KNRA 78 A) Kamaleswaram Manacaud P.O Manacaud Village Muttathara Ward Thiruvananthapuram 695009 By Advocate:- G Nissar Respondent _:- State of Kerala represented by the Inspector of Police, Medical College Police Station By Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumari This Criminal M.C. is coming on for hearing on 28.02.2025 and the court on 01.03.2025 passed the following : ORDER This is an application filed by the sole accused in the above crime under Section 483 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking regular bail. 2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable under Sections 115(2), 324(4) and 69 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. 2 3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- The accused, who got acquaintance with the defacto complainant, on 08.05.2023, took the defacto complainant to Vitara Rooms Lodge, Kumarapuram, and under the false promise of marriage, had sexual intercourse with her. Thereafter, on several occasions, at various places, till 26.01.2025, under the false promise of marriage, the accused had sexual intercourse with the defacto complainant. It is also alleged that, the accused voluntarily caused hurt to the defacto complainant saying various reasons, and on 25.01.2025, at Pop Town Hotel, the accused destroyed the mobile phone of the defacto complainant, and he withdrew from the promise of marriage. 4. Reportedly, the petitioner/accused was arrested on 01.02.2025 and he is in custody since then. 5. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The Investigating Officer filed report opposing the bail application. 6. Heard. Perused the records. 7. The only point to be considered is, whether regular bail can be granted to the petitioner/accused. 8. The Point:- The prosecution alleges that, the petitioner/accused, under a false promise of marriage, had sexual intercourse with the defacto complainant, on several occasions, at different places, and thereafter, withdrew 3 from the promise of marriage. It is also alleged that, the accused physically tortured the defacto complainant and destroyed her mobile phone. 9. According to the petitioner, he is innocent of the allegations levelled against him. It is submitted that, though the petitioner had acquaintance with the defacto complainant, there was no physical relationship, and the intention of the defacto complainant is to blackmail him. The petitioner submitted that, during his custody period, from 01.02.2025 onwards, the defacto complainant approached the parents of the petitioner several days and stated that she is going to get the F.I.R. quashed from the Honble High Court of Kerala, otherwise, the petitioner will not get bail and he will be in custody for years, and she demanded huge amount from them. 10. There is serious allegation as against the petitioner. However, it is seen from the First Information Statement that, there was an informal engagement between the defacto complainant and the petitioner, and photo- shoot was taken. So, it is indicative of the fact that there was no dishonest intention from the part of the petitioner at the inception of their relationship or at the time of the alleged commission of offence. It is seen that, the 183 statement of the defacto complainant was already recorded and that the investigation has progressed much. The petitioner/ accused is in judicial custody for a period of 28 days. It appears that further detention of the 4 petitioner is not warranted for the purpose of investigation. So even if the petitioner/accused is released on bail, there is nothing much, which will adversely affect the investigation. No criminal antecedents of the petitioner/accused is brought to the notice of this court. Considering the period of detention already undergone by the petitioner and the stage of investigation, I am of the view that, the petitioner/accused can be enlarged on bail subject to conditions. In the result, the petition is allowed and the petitioner/ accused is granted bail on the following conditions:- (1) Petitioner/accused shall execute bail bond for Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) with two solvent sureties for the like sum each to the satisfaction of the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Thiruvananthapuram. (2) Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer on every Wednesday between 10 a.m. and 12 noon for a period of 3 (three) months or till the final report is filed, whichever is earlier. (3) Petitioner shall not commit any offence while on bail. (4) Petitioner shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade them from disclosing such facts to the court or to any police officer or tamper with evidence. 5 (5) Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer as and when required by the Investigating Officer. (6) Petitioner shall fully co-operate with the investigation. In case of any violation of the above conditions or misuse of liberty, the prosecution or the defacto complainant is at liberty to approach jurisdictional court for cancellation of bail.
