CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 07.01.2019, ALONG WITH Cr1.MC.8849/2017, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: ee Crl.MC.No. 8849 & 8851 of 2017 201KERII6 3 ORDER The petitioner faces prosecution proceedings in two cases pending before the Judicial Magistrate of the First Class-II, Thrissur. In C.C.No0.4503 of 2014, the de facto complainant is his wife. In the said case, he is being proceeded against for having committed offence punishable under Section 498A of the IPC. In C.C.No.4230 of 2014, the de facto complainant is his daughter and he is accused of having committed offence punishable under Sections 323, 354A, 506(i) and 509 of the IPC. Both these cases are sought to be quashed by these petitions filed under Section 482 of the CrP.C. 2. I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, the learned counsel appearing for the respective de facto complainants in both cases, who have been arrayed as the 2\" respondent in these proceedings, and the learned Public Prosecutor. 3. The learned counsel appearing for both sides submitted that the entire disputes were referred to the Ernakulam Mediation Centre and the parties were able to arrive at a settlement. As per the terms, the petitioner had agreed to pay Rs.28,00,000/- to his wife and Rs.20,00,000/- to his daughter. The de facto complainants had agreed to hand over the title deeds of the residential home and the keys of Crl.MC.No. 8849 & 8851 of 2017 201KERII6 4 the building. 4. When the case was taken up today, the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has handed over two demand drafts for the agreed amount and the learned counsel appearing for the respondents have handed over the documents as well as the keys. It is submitted by the learned counsel appearing for both sides that the entire disputes having been settled, the continuance of proceedings against the petitioner is an abuse of process. 5. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted that the statement of the de facto complainant has been recorded and she has stated in clear terms that she has no subsisting grievance. 6. Ihave considered the submissions advanced. 6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303] and in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466], the Apex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. Further in Jitendra_Raghuvanshi_& Others v. Babita Raghuvanshi & Another [(2013) 4 SCC 58], it was observed that it is the duty of the courts to encourage genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes. If the parties ponder over their faults and terminate their disputes Crl.MC.No. 8849 & 8851 of 2017 201KERII6 5 amicably by mutual agreement instead of fighting it out in a court of law, the courts should not hesitate to exercise its powers under Section 482 of the Code. Permitting such proceedings to continue would be nothing, but an abuse of process of court. The interest of justice also require that the proceedings be quashed. 7. Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I am of the considered view that this Court will be well justified in invoking its extraordinary powers under Section 482 of the Code to quash the proceedings. In the result, these petitions will stand allowed. Annexure-Al final reports in both cases and all proceedings pursuant thereto against the petitioner now pending as C.C. Nos.4230/2014 and C.C.No. 4503/2014 on the file of Judicial Magistrate of First Class-II, Thrissur are quashed. Sd/- RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN V., JUDGE //TRUE COPY// P.A.
