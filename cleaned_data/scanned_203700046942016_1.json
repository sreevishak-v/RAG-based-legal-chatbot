PA.TO JUDGE Msd. eS D01GIKERIE3886 RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN V., J. Cri. M.C. No.4694 of 2016 Dated this the 3 day of August, 2016 ORDER 1.The petitioner herein is the 1 accused in S.C. No.180 of 2015 of the Additional Sessions Court, (Fast Track) III, Manjeri. He is charged for having committed offence punishable under Sections 341, 324 and 307 read with Section 34 of I.P.C. 2.As directed by this Court by Annexure-A2 order, the petitioner had surrendered before the learned Magistrate and he was granted bail subject to conditions. Among other conditions , the petitioner was also directed to produce his passport before the court below. 3.The petitioner is running a grocery business in the United Arab Emirates and in the said circumstances, 2016/KER/33886 Crl. M.C. No.4694 of 2016 -2- he filed an application before the learned Sessions Judge seeking release of the passport to travel abroad for a period of six months. The said application was allowed in part . The conditions imposed are extracted below for easy reference. 2. The passport produced by the petitioner in the above case is released to him for a period of 6 months from today, on executing a bond for the same with two solvent sureties for an amount of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees two lakhs only) each. 3. The passport shall be released to the petitioner on executing a bond as aforementioned and getting a proper acknowledge for the same. 4. It is directed that, the accused No.1/petitioner shall not leave the territory of India by using the existing passport or with the renewed passport, without the consent of this Court. 5. The petitioner is directed to produce the renewed passport before this Court within 10 days from the date of receipt of the same _ from the competent authorities. Blick 2016/KER/33886 Cri. M.C. No.4694 of 2016 -3- 4.Heard the learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner and learned Public Prosecutor. 5.The petitioner, it appears, is aggrieved by some of the passing references made by the _ learned Additional Sessions Judge in the impugned order. It is observed by the court below that the petitioner cannot be permitted to go abroad as he did seek to modify the conditions imposed by the Magistrate. It is also submitted that the directions that the petitioner should execute a bond for two solvent sureties for an amount of Rs.2 lakhs surety is onerous. The learned counsel prays that the petitioner be permitted to travel abroad for a period of six months at least in order to enable him to take care of his business abroad. Much reliance is placed by the learned Counsel on the order of this Court in S.K.Asok Kumar V State of Kerala 2009 (2) KLT 712 to advance his contentions. Blick 2016/KER/33886 Cri. M.C. No.4694 of 2016 -4- 6.The learned Public Prosecutor on the other hand, submitted that the petitioner is involved in a grave offence and it was after considering the various inputs that the learned Additional Sessions Judge had imposed the aforesaid conditions. It is submitted that the petitioner can always approach the learned Sessions Judge and seek permission to travel abroad and nothing in the Annexure A5 order prevents him from doing the same. 7.1 have considered the rival submissions. The likelihood of the case coming up for trial in the near future is very remote. The period sought for by the petitioner to travel abroad is for 6 months. The mere fact that the petitioner had not challenged the order passed by the learned Magistrate is not sufficient reason to deny him permission to travel abroad. However, the bond amount imposed by the Court below cannot be said to be onerous. 2016/KER/33886 Crl. M.C. No.4694 of 2016 -5- 8.Having regard to the facts and circumstances, I direct the learned Sessions Judge to_- grant permission to the petitioner to travel abroad for a period of six months. The petitioner shall execute the necessary bond before the Court below for the amount ordered and the court may also impose necessary conditions to ensure his presence before the court at the stage of trial. Petition is allowed as above. Sd/- RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN V. JUDGE SKV"
