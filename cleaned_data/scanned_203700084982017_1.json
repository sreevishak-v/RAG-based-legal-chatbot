Having considered the above facts and the nature of allegations which discloses only a personal dispute between the parties and also considering the fact that, there is nothing on record to show that the petitioner herein is involved in any other crime, I am inclined to invoke the jurisdiction under section 482 Cr.P.C to quash the criminal proceedings to meet the ends of justice. In the result, Crl.M.C is allowed. All further proceedings arising from Crime No.450 of 2017 of Vadanappally Police Station will stand quashed.
