CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 08.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: ape 2024/KER/1574 Crl.M.C. NO.108 OF 2024 2 ORDER Dated this the 8\" day of January , 2024 This Crl.M.C., under Section 482 of Cr.P.C., is filed by the first accused in C.C.No.1404 of 2016, on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-III, Thiruvananthapuram, to direct the Magistrate to recall the arrest warrant pending against him and to release the petitioner on bail, in the event of his appearance/surrender before that court. 2. The petitioner herein is alleged to have committed offences punishable under Sections 354, 451, 323 and 506(ii) r/w Section 34 of IPC. He got anticipatory bail from this Court as early as on 23.06.2016. But it seems that, he did not appear before the Investigating Officer, to execute the bond as directed by this Court, in the order dated 23.06.2016. Now he is intending to surrender before the learned Magistrate and his request is to direct the Magistrate to recall the warrant and to release apa 2024/KERIN574 Cri.M.C. NO.108 OF 2024 3 him on bail when he surrenders before that court. 3. The case is of the year 2016. The petitioner, after getting anticipatory bail, did not even care to execute the bond, as directed by this Court. His case is that he did not get summons from the court and so he failed to appear before the learned Magistrate. Now this Court is not in a_ position to verify the genuineness of his contentions. So, the petitioner can appear/surrender in C.C.No.1404 of 2016 pending before Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-III, Thiruvananthapuram. In case, he makes a application for bail, learned Magistrate has to consider and pass appropriate orders in that petition, on the date of appearance/surrender itself, as far as, possible. With these directions, this Crl.M.C. is disposed of. Sd/- SOPHY THOMAS JUDGE SSK/08/01 ae peat es 2024/KER/1574 Crl.M.C.
