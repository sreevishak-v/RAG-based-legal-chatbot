Petitioner had initially been released on _ bail. However, thereafter he absconded and due to his failure to appear before the Court, bail already granted, was cancelled and a non bailable warrant has been issued apart from steps initiated under Section 82 and 83 of Cr.P.C. 3. Sri.Suresh B.S., the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner is willing to appear before the Trial court and seek bail. However, he apprehend that he may be remanded to custody before considering his bail application. 4. Sri.C.S.Hrithwik, the learned Public Prosecutor, opposed the Bier each Se | aes oH 2024/KER/627 CRL.MC NO. 65 OF 2024 3 contentions and submitted that the non bailable warrant issued to the petitioner is to secure his presence before the trial court. 5. Since the petitioner has undertaken that he will appear before the trial court without fail, I am of the view that an opportunity ought to be granted to the petitioner. 6. Therefore, if the petitioner appears before the trial court on or before 16.01.2024 and applies for recall of warrant and for grant of bail, those applications shall be considered by the learned Magistrate on the same day itself. To enable the petitioner to appear before the learned Magistrate, coercive proceedings pursuant to the non bailable warrant issued in C.C.No.207/2019 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Ernakulam shall be kept in abeyance till 16.01.2024. This Crl.M.C. is disposed of. sd/- BECHU KURIAN THOMAS JUDGE AMV/06/01/2024 Ps) Soe Else 2024/KER/627 CRL.MC NO. 65 OF 2024 4 APPENDIX OF CRL.MC 65/2024 PETITIONER ANNEXURES ANNEXURE Ai THE COPY OF THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT CARD ISSUED THE GENERAL HOSPITAL ERNAKULAM ON 05.07.2021 ANNEXURE A2 THE COPY OF THE MEDICAL CERTIFICATE ISSUED BY THE RENAI MEDICITY HOSPITAL ERNAKULAM DATED 07.04.2022 ANNEXURE A3 THE COPY OF THE ADVISED ON DISCHARGED SIGNED BY THE LEAD CONSULTANT NEUROSURGEON AT RENAL MEDICITY DATED 13.7.2021 ANNEXURE A4.
