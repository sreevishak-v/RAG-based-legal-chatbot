RESPONDENT'S EXHIBITS NIL R.AV TRUE COPY/ PATO JUDGE 2017/KER/1507 SUNIL THOMAS, J. ~ Cri.M.(C).No.2641 of 2016 Dated this the 11\" day of January, 2017 ORDER The petitioner herein is the accused No.2 in Crime No.407/2011 of Nadapuram Police Station in SC.No.1104 of 2014 on the files of the Assistant Sessions Court, Vatakara for offence punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 323, 326, 427, 308 r/w Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code. 2. According to the prosecution, on 21.08.2011 the petitioner along with several other persons formed into an unlawful assembly and in furtherance of their common object attacked the defacto complainant and others. The first accused was pulled out of his car and hit on the head with a stick. Crime was registered and after investigation, final report was laid. All other accused except the petitioner herein and accused No.2 faced the trial before the court below. By Annexure-A3 judgment all the accused who faced the trial were acquitted. 2017/KER/1507 Cri.M.(C).No.2641 of 2016 2 Contending that the petitioner herein is entitled for the benefit of acquittal arrived at by the Sessions Court in Annexure-A3 and that the substratum of the case is broken in the light of the above finding, the petitioner seeks to quash the proceedings. 3. Opposing the application the learned Public Prosecutor submitted that the petitioner is involved in few other cases. It was further pointed out that the petitioner herein remained absent for a long period and he is trying to get a benefit of acquittal by the co-accused who faced the trial. The learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned counsel for the second respondent-defacto complainant submitted that, they have resolved their disputes evidenced by Annexure-A5 affidavit. It was further pointed out that there were series of incident and all the persons in the locality were roped in several cases. Other cases in which the petitioner herein is involved are the cases registered on the same day as a sequel to the main case. I find some substance in that contention. It is pertinent to note that in Annexure-A3 2017/KER/1507 Cri.M.(C).No.2641 of 2016 3 judgment, the court below had clearly arrived at a finding that all the material witnesses failed to support the prosecution and had not identified the accused. In the light of above, I find that no purpose will be served by prosecuting the petitioner herein, which can only result in manifest injustice and mere waste of time. There is no likelihood of the care ending in a successful conviction. Though the allegation against the accused is serious insofar as Sections 308 and 326 IPC are attributed. There is no clear material to establish offence under Section 308 of IPC. Hence I am inclined to allow the Crl.M.C and all the further proceedings SC.No.1104/2014 on the files of the Assistant Sessions Court, Vatakara as against the petitioner herein stands quashed.
