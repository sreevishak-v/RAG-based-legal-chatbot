Criminal M.C.No. 652/2025 Crime No 47/2025 of Pallickal Police Station, Pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court -II Attingal Petitioner/Accused _:- Babu aged 61 years S/o. Bhargavan BB Bhvan Near Pakalkuri LPS Pallickal Village Thiruvananthapuram By Advocate:- ZareenaR Counter Petitioner :- Sub Inspector of Police Pallickal Police Station By Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumari This Criminal M.C. is coming on for hearing on 03.03.2025 and the court on 04.03.2025 passed the following :: ORDER This is an application filed by the sole accused in the above crime under Section 483 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking regular bail. 2. The petitioner/accused is alleged to have committed the offences punishable under Sections 296(b), 118(1), 126(2), 124(1) and 109(1) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. 3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- The accused is the husband of the defacto complainant. On 30.01.2023, the accused attempted 2 to commit murder of the defacto complainant and her daughter by pouring petrol over their body and by setting them fire. A case was registered in this regard as Crime No. 105/2023 of Pallickal Police Station, registered for the offences punishable u/ss. 294(b), 506, 511 of 436 and 308 of Indian Penal Code. Due to this animosity, on 10.01.2025 at about 7 p.m., the accused entered into the hall room of the house of the victim, situated in Pallickal Village and uttered abusive words against her, caught hold of her hair and forcefully poured acid into her mouth. As a result, the acid fell on the face, lips, nose and back of the victim, causing grievous burn injuries. 4. Reportedly, the petitioner/ accused was arrested on 11.01.2025 and he is in custody since then. 5. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The Investigating Officer filed report opposing the bail application. 6. Heard. Perused the records. 7. The only point to be considered is, whether regular bail can be granted to the petitioner/ accused. 8. The Point:- The petitioner/accused is the husband of the defacto complainant. It is alleged that, the petiitoner/accused had attempted to cause death of his wife by pouring acid. The motive for the alleged incident is the animosity that arose when the defacto complainant filed a complaint before the police when the accused attempted to kill her and her daughter. 3 9. According to the petitioner, he is innocent of the allegations levelled against him. It is submitted by the petitioner that, the injuries are simple in nature and it only attracts the offences punishable u/ss. 118(1) and 124(2) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, and Section 109(1) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita is not attracted in this case. 10. The magnitude of the offence alleged is grave. Allegedly, the petitioner/accused had poured acid into the mouth of his wife/defacto complainant. Reportedly, the defacto complainant/victim had sustained burn injuries in the incident. The certificate of examination by the Medical Officer shows that burns are seen on the right upper chest and axilla. It is seen that the dying declaration of the victim was also recorded from Medical College Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram. So the prosecution has made out the prima facie case against the petitioner and the involvement of the petitioner / accused in the alleged offence. The learned Public Prosecutor strongly opposed the bail application stating that the petitioner is having great animosity against the defacto complainant and he is following her to do away her, and so releasing the petitioner on bail would be a threat to the defacto complainant. In the dying declaration appended along with the report, it is seen that the victim had given statement to that effect. It is stated in the report that the petitioner is involved in five other crimes. The investigation in this case is progressing. The petitioner / accused is in judicial custody only for a period of 52 days. If 4 the petitioner/ accused is released on bail at this stage, he is likely to influence or intimidate the victim and the other witnesses and tamper with the evidence. The chance of absconding also cannot be ruled out. So, the investigation will be adversely affected. Considering all the afore facts, including the gravity of the offence, this court is not inclined to release the petitioner on bail at this stage. In the result, this petition is dismissed.
