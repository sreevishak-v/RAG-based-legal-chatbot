SRI. M.C. ASHI (PP) SRI. VIPIN T. JOSE (FOR RESPONDENT) THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 22.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: BTR aR 2024/KER/5270 CRL.MC 103/2024 3 BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J eee i ee ORDER Petitioners have invoked the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C to quash all proceedings against them. 2. Petitioners are accused Nos. 1 to 9 in C.C.No.317/2020 on the files of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Kasaragod, arising out of Crime No.438/2019 of Badiadkka Police Station registered for the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, and 427 r/w Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The 24 respondent is the defacto complainant. 3. According to the prosecution, accused formed themselves into an unlawful assembly, protested against the Citizenship Amendment Act, and pelted stones on the car of the de facto complainant, causing damage to it, and thereby committed the offences alleged. 4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned BTR aR 2024/KER/5270 CRL.MC_103/2024 4 counsel for the respondent, apart from the learned Public Prosecutor. 5. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the matter has been settled and hence the proceedings against the petitioners ought to be quashed. It was also submitted that, considering the nature of offences alleged, no purpose would be served by continuing the proceedings. 6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and Another |(2012) 10 SCC 303], the Apex Court has held that in appropriate cases, the High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. This view was reiterated in Narinder Singh and Others vy. State of Punjab and Another [(2014) 6 SCC 466] and Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State of Jharkhand and Another [(2014) 9 SCC 653]. 7. 1 have perused Annexure-AlIl affidavit filed by the 27 respondent. The learned Public Prosecutor has submitted that upon verification, it is understood that the affidavit is genuine, and the de facto complainant stands by the contents thereof. I DP. ee 4 2024/KER/5270 CRL.MC 103/2024 5 am satisfied that the matter has been settled and no public interest is involved in this case. There is no impediment for granting the prayer for quashing. The continuance of the proceedings will only be an exercise in futility. 8. Though the learned Public Prosecutor pointed out that accused 3 to 6, 8 and 10 have criminal antecedents against them, I am of the view that considering the nature of the settlement arrived at between the parties, no purpose would be achieved in continuing the prosecution. 9. Accordingly, all proceedings against the petitioners in C.C.No.317/2020 on the files of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Kasaragod, are quashed. This Crl.M.C is allowed as above. sd/- BECHU KURIAN THOMAS JUDGE AMV/22/01/2024 Biel oe. she 2024/KER/S270 CRL.MC_103/2024 6 APPENDIX OF CRL.MC 103/2024 PETITIONER ANNEXURES ANNEXURE AI A TRUE COPY OF THE F.I.R IN CRIME NO. 438 OF 2019 OF BADIADKA POLICE STATION, KASARAGOD ANNEXURE AII CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT IN CRIME NO. 438 OF 2019 OF BADIADKA POLICE STATION, KASARAGOD ANNEXURE AIITI THE AFFIDAVIT SWORN TO BY THE RESPONDENT TRUE COPY"
