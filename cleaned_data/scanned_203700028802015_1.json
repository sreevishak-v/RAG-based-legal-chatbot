TO JUDGE STK eo a 2018/KER/479 B. SUDHEENDRA KUMAR, J. Cri. M.C. No.2880 of 2015 Dated this the 5\" day of January, 2018 ORDER The petitioner is the accused in C.C.No.18/2014 on the files of the court below. The above case arose out of a private complaint filed by the first respondent herein before the court below against the petitioner alleging offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. 2. The case was. originally pending = as S.T.No.21/2010 before the court below. However, thereafter, the case was converted as C.C.No.18/2014 by the court below. The court below also ordered denova trial on the ground that a part of the evidence was recorded by the predecessor of the presiding officer of the court below. 3. The petitioner filed C.M.P.No.62/2014 before the court below praying for sending Ext.P1 cheque for expert opinion for ascertaining as to whether the signature, date, eo a 2018/KER/479 Cri. M.C. No.2880 of 2015 i 2t- name and amount in Ext.P1 were authorised by a single person or not. The court below as per Annexure-G order dated 4.2.2015 dismissed the said C.M.P., against which this Crl.M.C. has been filed. 4. Heard both sides. 5. The petitioner earlier filed C.M.P.No.8/2011, praying for sending Ext.Pl cheque for _ forensic examination of the handing. Even though the said application was allowed initially, the same was subsequently dismissed on the reason that the petitioner did not produce specimen signature. Thereafter, the petitioner filed C.M.P.No.60/2011 for sending Ext.P1 cheque and Ext.P8 letter for expert opinion. The court below allowed the prayer in respect of Ext.P8 letter. However, the court below turned down the prayer with regard to Ext.P1 cheque. Thereafter, the petitioner filed the present petition. eo a 2018/KER/479 Cri. M.C. No.2880 of 2015 i 3ue 6. | have gone through the evidence of PW1. PW1 stated that Ext.P1 was filled up before bringing the same to the complainant and thereafter, the accused put the signature in Ext.P1 cheque in the presence of PW1. The evidence of PW1 is clear that PW1 did not see the accused or any other person filling up the cheque. What PW1 had seen was only affixing the signature in the cheque by the accused. In view of the above evidence of PW1, no purpose will be served even if the present petition is allowed. In the said circumstances, there is no meaning in ascertaining as to whether the signature, date, name and amount in Ext.P1 were written by the same person or not. For the said reason, | am not inclined to set aside the order impugned. Accordingly, this Crl.M.C. stands dismissed. However, | make it clear that if Ext.P8 is not yet sent for expert opinion as per the order of the court below in C.M.P.No.60/2011 in S.T.No.21/2010, the petitioner shall Bare et : BRE; 2018/KER/479 Cri. M.C. No.2880 of 2015 -: 435- be at liberty to file fresh application before the court below for the same. Sd/- B. SUDHEENDRA KUMAR, JUDGE STK /[TRUE COPY// /IP.A. TO JUDGE//"
