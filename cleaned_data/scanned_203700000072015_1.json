M.C No. 7 of 2015 Dated this the 6\" day of January, 2015. ORDER The petitioner herein is the sole accused in C.C No.254/2013 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Malappuram. Crime in the case was registered under Sections 341, 323, 324 and 506(i) IPC on the complaint of one Anwar Sadath. He is the second respondent in this proceeding. The petitioner seeks orders quashing the prosecution on the ground that he and Anwar Sadath have come to terms amicably out of court. The de facto complainant Anwar Sadath has filed affidavit to the effect that he has settled the dispute with the accused, and he has no grievance or complaint. I find that the parties have really come to terms amicably, and continuance of prosecution in such a situation will not serve any purpose, other than wasting the precious time of the court. In the result, this petition is allowed. The prosecution against the petitioner in C.C No.254/2013 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Malappuram will stand quashed under Section 482 aan Pe phates oa 2015/KER/209 Crl. M.C No. 7 of 2015 2 Cr.P.C. Accordingly, he will stand released from prosecution, and the bail bond, if any, executed by him will stand discharged. P.UBAID, JUDGE sab"
