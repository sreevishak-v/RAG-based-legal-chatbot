TO JUDGE bp P.UBAID, J. 2015/KER/210 \"Cr M.C..Mo. 9 OF 2015 Dated this the 6\" day of January, 2015 ORDER The petitioner herein is the original second accused in C.C. No.161/2006 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Hosdurg. Of the ten accused in the case, seven faced trial in C.C. No.161/2006 and obtained a judgment of acquittal when the prosecution failed to procure the presence of the material witnesses during trial. The case against the original accused Nos.2,4 & 5 was split up and refiled as C.C. No.612/2008. Later, the original accused No.5 also got acquittal in C.C. No,612/2008 on 24/1/2011 when the material witness did not support the prosecution. The case against the original accused Nos. 2 & 4 was again split up and refiled. Later, the case against the original 4 accused was quashed by this Court as per the order dated 8/2/2013 in Crl.M.C. No.369/2013. Now, the case against the petitioner is pending as C.C. No.1587/2013. He also seeks orders quashing the prosecution on the ground that he and the de fcto complainant have come to terms amicably out of Court. The de facto 2015/KER/210 CrI.M.C. .No.9 of 2015 22: complainant C.P.Mahamood is the 2 respondent in this proceeding. He has filed affidavit to the effect that he has settled the whole dispute with the accused, and he has no grievance or complaint. The offence involved in this case are under Sections 143,147,148 & 324 read with Section 149 of IPC. Since composition is not possible, orders are sought under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. All the other accused in the crime stand acquitted. In such a situation, continuance of the prosecution, as against the petitioner herein, will not serve any purpose other than wasting the precious time of the court. Nobody will support the prosecution if the case goes to trial. In the result, the Crl.M.C. is allowed. The prosecution against the petitioner in C.C. No.1587/2013 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Hosdurg, will stand quashed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Accordingly, the petitioner will stand released from the prosecution, and the bail bond, if any, executed by him will stand discharged. Sd/- P.UBAID, Judge. dpk /True copy/ PS to Judge.
