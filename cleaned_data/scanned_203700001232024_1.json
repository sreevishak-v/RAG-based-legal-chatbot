According to the petitioner, he stands charge sheeted, along with 3 other accused persons, for offences punishable under Sections 468, 471, 419 and 420 r/w Section 34 of IPC. The crime is of the year 2005 and the defacto complainant is now no more. Moreover, the petitioner and the defacto complainant are relatives and the matter also stands settled. Since he did not get summons from the trial court, he could not appear before the court. Moreover, he was working in Gulf, and so he failed to appear before the court, and so his case was 2024/KER/1255 Crl.M.C. NO.123 OF 2024 3 transferred to long pending register. Now, he wants to surrender before the trial court and his prayer is to direct the Magistrate to release him on bail on the date of surrender itself. Adverting to the facts and circumstances, this Court is inclined to direct the petitioner to surrender before Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Tirur on or before 31.01.2024, and his application for bail, if any, has to be considered by learned Magistrate positively on the date of surrender itself, and learned Magistrate has to pass appropriate orders, taking into account the factual situations pleaded by him. In order to facilitate the petitioner to surrender before the Magistrate court, the non-bailable warrant now pending against the petitioner shall be kept in abeyance till 31.01.2024. With these directions this Crl.M.C. is disposed of. Sd/- SOPHY THOMAS JUDGE SSK/08/01 Blea ae area BA seni 2024/KER/1255 Cr1.M.C.
