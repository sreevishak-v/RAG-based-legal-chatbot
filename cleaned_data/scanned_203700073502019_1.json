CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 06.01.2020, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Crl.MC.No.7350 OF 2019(G) 2 2020/KER/LI7 ORDER Dated this the 6th day of January 2020 Petitioners are accused in C.C No.925/2016 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kalamassery for having allegedly committed offences punishable under Sections 341,332, 294(b), 506(i) r/w Section 34 of IPC. 2. The de facto complainant and injured is the 3\" respondent, who has appeared through counsel and filed affidavit to the effect that the matter has been amicably settled with the petitioners and that he has no grievance against them. Even though Section 332 is incorporated in the final report, it is doubtful whether Section 332 is attracted because there is no allegation to the effect that the injured was in the process of performing his official duty. The mere fact that he was traveling in a police jeep as driver of the jeep, is not sufficient to attract Section 332. A report has been called for from the investigating officer to the effect that the matter has been settled between the parties. Petitioners and the 3 respondent are relatives and Crl.MC.No.7350 OF 2019(G) 3 2020/KER/LI7 the family disputes between them have been settled amicably. No public interest is involved. In the result, the Crl.M.C is allowed and the entire proceedings in C.C. No.925/2016 pending on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kalamassery stands quashed under Section 482 of Cr.P.C and the accused are discharged.
