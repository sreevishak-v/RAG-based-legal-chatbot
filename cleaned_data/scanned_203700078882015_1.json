CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 08.12.2017, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: a 2017/KER/49773 Crl.MC.No. 7888 of 2015 2 MARY JOSEPH, J. ~ CrL.M.C.No.7888 of 2015 Dated this the 8\" day of December, 2017 ORDER The final report filed by the first respondent before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Muvattupuzha (for short the court below), in Crime No. 1575/2014 registered for the offences under Section 341, 420, 427, 448 & 506(i) of the Indian Penal Code is sought to be quashed in this proceedings. Petitioner is the sole accused in the said crime. After taking cognizance of the case, it was numbered as C.C.No. 1215/2015. The case was not proceeded with any further due to the stay of the proceedings by this court. 2. The allegation against the petitioner was that, he had cheated the defacto complainant and wrongfully restrained him from entering into a room bearing No.657/C, which has been taken on rent by him from the petitioner on 14.06.2014. The further allegation was that the petitioner had destroyed the dental equipments kept in the room and also intimidated him by threatening. Based on the allegations, the crime in question was registered. The investigation was proceeded on the basis of the crime so registered and after concluding the investigation, the a 2017/KER/49773 Crl.MC.No. 7888 of 2015 3 final report as Annexure A4 was laid before the court below and that is sought to be quashed by this Crl.M.C. 3. Sri. M.A.Abdul Hakhim, the learned counsel representing the petitioner has submitted that, the action of the first respondent in entertaining Annexure A2 petition, registering Annexure A3 FIR and submitting Annexure A4 Final Report is a clear abuse of the criminal judicial process. According to him, the allegations raised either in Annexure A2 petition or later on by the defacto complainant in the statement given by him under Section 161 CrP.C, do not constitute the ingredients of the offences under Section 341, 420, 427,448 & 506(i) of IPC. It is further contended by the learned counsel that, being an Advocate by profession, he cannot conduct a dental clinic as alleged in Annexure A2 petition. He has also relied on Annexure AQ, the reply issued by the Payipra Grama Panchayath to a querry under the Right to Information Act that no establishment has been functioning in the disputed room since 01.09.2010 and contended on its basis that the allegations of the defacto complainant would not sustain. He has also relied on Annexure Al Commission Report to contend that room No. 657/C was occupied by the petitioner himself and a clinic as alleged was bea 2017/KER/49773 Crl.MC.No. 7888 of 2015 4 not conducted by the defacto complainant at the relevant time when the commission of the offences was allegedly taken place. Raising the contentions as aforesaid, the learned counsel prayed for quashing Annexure A4 Charge Sheet. 4. Sri. A.P.Subash, the learned counsel representing the defacto complainant has submitted on the contrary that, the ingredients of the offences alleged by the prosecution are well attracted from the allegations on hand. According to him, as per the allegations the defacto complainant was restrained from entering into the room, which was occupied by him and that is sufficient to attract the offence under Section 341. It is also contended by the counsel that, since the allegations would disclose that the petitioner had broken the lock and entered into the room occupied by the defacto complainant, the ingredients of the offence under Section 448 would be attracted. It is also contended by the counsel that an element of cheating could well be drawn from the allegations, since the defacto complainant is continuing occupancy of the room taken on rent even after the expiry of the period of lease. He has placed reliance on Annexure Ai to submit that in view of the collusive nature of the suit filed by the petitioner bea 2017/KER/49773 Crl.MC.No. 7888 of 2015 5 against his brother as disclosed from Annexure Ail, the element of cheating would be attracted. The further contention of the learned counsel was that since the dental equipments kept in the room have been allegedly destroyed, the offence under Section 427 is also attracted. The final contention was that since the allegation include the threat to kill against the defacto complainant there is nothing to doubt the sustainability of the offence under Section 506(i) IPC. 5. The learned Public Prosecutor is also heard in the matter. 6. In the matter of the rival contentions advanced by the learned counsel representing the petitioner and the defacto complainant, it is necessary to have a glance at the allegations in Annexure A2 petition, which led to the registration of the crime in question. 7. Going by the contentions in Annexure A2 petition, it is seen that the offences alleged except the one punishable under Section 420 would be prima facie attracted. The allegations as they stand in Annexure A2 petition are extracted herein.

On the basis of the allegations as aforesaid that the crime was registered and investigation was commenced. It is in the course of which, the statement of the defacto complainant was recorded Pa El basa 2017/KER/49773 Crl.MC.No. 7888 of 2015 7 under Section 161 CrP.C., a copy of which statement is made available to the Court. While giving statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C. also the defacto complainant has not deviated from the allegations primarily raised by him in the First Information Statement. What follows therefrom was that consistency is maintained in the version regarding the occurrence as alleged. 8. It is relevant to have a scrutiny of the allegations to see whether the commission of the offence of cheating by the petitioner could prima facie be derived. The pith and substance of the allegations as it stands in the FIS extracted supra. Therefore, this Court needs to venture to see in that backdrop whether the ingredients constituting the offence of cheating could be drawn therefrom. For that purpose, it is apposite to extract Section 415 IPC hereunder: Cheating.- Whoever, by deceiving any person, fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to consent that any person shall retain any property, or intentionally induces the person so deceived to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived, and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body, mine, reputation or property, is said to cheat. 9. It is provided in the definition that in order to attract the offence of cheating, the act must have been done with an intention to bea 2017/KER/49773 Cr1.MC.No. 7888 of 2015 8 deceive and an extraction of something based on that false promise. 10. Ingredients constituting the offence are not derived from the set of allegations as put forth by the defacto complainant either in the FIS lodged to set the law in motion or in the statement recorded under Section 161 CrP.C., to support the allegation of cheating against the petitioner. Therefore, this Court is constrained to take a view that the allegations are insufficient to discern a view that the petitioner had committed an offence of cheating as defined under Section 415 IPC. Therefore, the accused is not liable to be prosecuted under Section 420 IPC. Apart from the offence under Section 420 IPC, all other offences alleged against the petitioner would prima facie sustain. Therefore, the prosecution in respect of all offences except the one under Section 420 IPC is liable to be maintained. In the result, Crl.M.C stands allowed in part and Annexure A4 final report, to the extent it chargesheeting the accused for the offence under Section 420 IPC and further proceedings initiated pursuant to that stands quashed.
