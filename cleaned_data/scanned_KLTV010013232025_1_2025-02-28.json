No.531/2025 (Crime No. 243/2025 of Aryanad Police Station ) Petitioners/Accused Nos.1 to 3:- 1. Binukumar T L, aged 54 years, S/o M Thankappan, Gosalakkunnu, Azhikodu, Karakulam PO, Thiruvananthapuram. 2. Sumayya, aged 38 years, W/o Thaswath, Binubhavan, Manaluvila, Aryanad PO, Thiruvananthapuram. 3. Thaswath, aged 40 years, S/o Thajudheen, Manaluvila, Aryanad PO, Thiruvananthapuram. By Advocates. M A Kasim and Alif KS RESPONDENT:- State of Kerala represented by Station House Officer, Aryanad Police Station. By Public Prosecutor Dr T Geena Kumary This Crl.M.C. came up for hearing on 25/02/2025 and the court on 28-02-2025 passed the following : ORDER This is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail. 2. The petitioners are alleged to have committed the offences punishable under Sections 126(2), 115(2), 118(1) and 351, r/w Section 3(5) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, and Crime No. 243/2025 of Aryanad Police Criminal M.C.No.531/2025 1/6 Station is registered against the petitioners arraying them as accused Nos. 1 to 3. 3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- The defacto complainant is the wife of the 1* accused. During the period from 2021 to February 2024, the defacto complainant rented out the residential building, owned by her husband, situated at Cheriya Aryanad to accused Nos. 2 and 3. When the defacto complainant came to know that, her husband is having illicit relationship with the 2\" accused, she evicted accused Nos. 2 and 3 from the house. The defacto complainant got information that, even after vacating the house, the 2 accused used to come to the said house along with the 1\" accused. On 19.01.2025 at about 1 p.m. the defacto complainant came to the said house and found accused Nos.2 and 3 along with her husband, the 1* accused, in the said house. At that time, the 2\"? accused caught hold of the hair of the defacto complainant and pulled her towards the courtyard, and thereafter, the 1* accused beat her on her left palm, by using a stick, and twisted on her left shoulder, and the 3\" accused threatened her with fear of death. 4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The Investigating Officer filed report opposing the anticipatory bail application. 5. Heard. Perused the records. 6. The only point to be considered is, whether an order of anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioners/accused Nos. 1 to 3. Criminal M.C.No.531/2025 2/6 7. The Point:- The 1* petitioner/ 1* accused is the husband of the defacto complainant. It is alleged that, the petitioners/ accused Nos. 1 to 3 had assaulted the defacto complainant, when she questioned the presence of the 2 accused along with the 1* petitioner / 1 accused. 8. The petitioners submit that, the defacto complainant is the wife of 1* accused and the relationship between them got strained and hence, the 1* accused approached the Family court, Thiruvananthapuram, for divorce and filed O.P.No. 76/2025. It is submitted that, the 3 accused is the husband of the 2 accused, and the alleged illicit relationship between the 1* and 2 accused is a cooked up story, in order to implicate the petitioners in the present case. The petitioners submitted that, there is an inordinate delay of 25 days in lodging the F.I.R., as the alleged incident took place on 19.01.2025, but the information is received in the Police Station only on 13.02.2025. According to the petitioners, they are innocent of the allegations levelled against them. The petitioners have produced a copy of the Original Petition for divorce filed before the Family Court, Nedumangadu, to substantiate their contentions. 9. The magnitude of the offence alleged is grave. The alleged incident occurred in the house owned by the 1* petitioner / 1* accused, which was earlier given for rent to the 2\" accused. Going by the First Information Statement given by the defacto complainant, it is seen that, though the house was leased out to the 2 accused earlier, she was evicted from there in the Criminal M.C.No.531/2025 3/6 month of February 2024, and later, on the alleged date of incident, when the defacto complainant saw her husband along with the 2 accused, she had questioned the same as she had noticed instances of illicit relationship between the two. According to the defacto complainant, the 2\" accused was evicted from the said house in view of the relationship between the two, and even after that, when she noticed that the 1 petitioner and the 2 accused used to come there, she had questioned the same, and thereafter, the petitioners had assaulted the defacto complainant. It is stated in the body note attached to the First Information Statement that the defacto complainant had pain on the left palm. It is stated in the report filed by the Investigating Officer that the stick used for the commission of the offence is recovered. So, the prosecution has made out a prima facie case against the petitioners/ accused Nos. 1 to 3 and regarding the involvement of the petitioners in the alleged offence. It is also stated in the report that the scene plan is to be obtained and the statement of the defacto complainant under Section 183 of BNSS is to be recorded. The investigation is progressing. The learned counsel for the petitioners argued that, this is a false complaint initiated after the matrimonial dispute between the 1* petitioner and his wife. He also submitted that, an Original Petition was filed before the Family Court for dissolution of marriage. The learned Public Prosecutor stated that the Original Petition is filed after the alleged incident. It is seen from the First Information Statement that, on that date, the defacto complainant and the Criminal M.C.No.531/2025 4/6 1* petitioner were living together and that the dispute between them was in fact related to the alleged illicit relationship of the 1\" petitioner with the 2\" accused. So the allegation against the petitioners cannot be considered as a false allegation as there are materials to show the occurrence of the alleged incident. Considering the facts stated in the report to the effect that the petitioners are involved in the offence, it appears that exceptional jurisdiction to grant a pre- arrest bail cannot be exercised in this case. 10. In Jai Prakash Singh v. State of Bihar and Another (2012 (4) SCC 379), the Honble Apex court has held that, an order of pre-arrest bail being an extra ordinary privilege, should be granted only in exceptional cases. It is settled in law that arrest should be the last option and it should be restricted to cases where arrest is imperative in the facts and circumstances of a case and consistent view is that the grant of anticipatory bail shall be restricted to exceptional circumstances. So it is clear that the power to grant anticipatory bail under section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita. is an exceptional power and should be exercised only in exceptional cases and not as a matter of course. Its object is to ensure that a person should not be harassed or humiliated in order to satisfy the grudge or personal vendetta of the complainant. [Reliance placed on the decision rendered by the Honble Apex Court in HDFC Bank Limited v. J.J. Mannan and Another (2010 (1) SCC 679); Srikant Upadhyay v. State of Bihar (2024 KHC Online 6137)]. In the Criminal M.C.No.531/2025 5/6 case at hand, I find no exceptional circumstance to exercise the exceptional power of granting anticipatory bail. 11. Considering the serious allegation against the petitioners and gravity of the offence, it appears that granting the petitioners with an order of anticipatory bail will adversely affect the investigation. If an order of anticipatory bail is granted, they are likely to influence the witnesses and tamper with the evidence. Considering all these aspects, this court is not inclined to grant an order of pre-arrest bail to the petitioners. In the result, this petition is dismissed. Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and pronounced by me in Open Court on this the 28\" day of February, 2025. Sd/- NAZEERA S.
