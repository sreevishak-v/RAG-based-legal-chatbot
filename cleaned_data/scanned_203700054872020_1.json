R2-3 BY ADV. BIJU VARGHESE ABRAHAM SR.PP.C.S.HRITHWIK THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 11.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Crme 5487/2020 > 2021/KER/1701 V.G.ARUN, J. -GrLM.C.NO.5487 of 2020. Dated this the 11\" day of January, 2021. ORDER Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.106 of 2018 registered at the Chirayinkeezhu Police Station for the offence punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 323, 324 & 427 r/w 149 of IPC, now pending as C.C.No.1474 of 2018 of Judicial First Class Magjistrate-III, Attingal. The de facto complainants at whose instance the crime was registered are respondents 2 and 3. Annexure E affidavit has been filed by the 2 respondent, and Annexure F by the 3% respondent stating that the dispute has been settled and that they have no subsisting grievance against the petitioner. 2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also, who, on instructions, submits that the petitioner has no_ criminal antecedents. 3. Having considered the gravity of the offences alleged, nature of the injury caused and having perused the affidavit filed by the respondents 2 and 3, the contents of which are submitted to be true and voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled and that no public interest is involved in this matter. Crme 5487/2020 3 2021/KER/1701 Under normal circumstances, piece-meal quashing of proceedings is not entertained by this court. As far as the instant case is concerned, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that petitioner's employment is at stake, unless and until the proceedings are quashed and certificate to that effect produced before the authorities. Taking the special circumstances and the fact that the allegation is only of an offence under Section 324 IPC, having been committed by the petitioner along with others, the prayer for quashing the proceedings is being entertained. Moreover, in view of the settlement, possibility of the criminal proceedings ending in conviction is remote. As such, continuance of the proceedings will amount to an abuse of process of court and hence, in view of the legal position set out by the Honourable Supreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is no impediment in granting the relief sought. 4. In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. The proceedings in C.C.No.1474 of 2018 of Judicial First Class Magistrate-III, Attingal is quashed.
