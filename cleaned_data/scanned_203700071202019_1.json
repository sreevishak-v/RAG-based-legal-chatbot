OTHER PRESENT: RAMESH CHAND-SR.G.P THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 06.01.2020, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Crl.MC.No.7120 OF 2019 (H) 2 2020/KERID9 ORDER Dated this the 6th day of January 2020 Petitioner is the 4 accused in S.C No.98/2017 on the files of the Additional Sessions Court-II, Manjeri for having allegedly committed offences punishable under Sections 341, 324, 302 and 201 r/w Section 34 of IPC along with some other accused. 2. The petitioner was permitted to go abroad for a period of two years and his passport was released, thereafter he sought extension of further period of six months which also was allowed, but on expiry of that further period of six months, he did not surrender and his prayer for further extension of six months was disallowed by the court vide Annexure A order. Thereafter, the petitioner surrendered his passport and sought further time of six months to go abroad which was disallowed by the court vide Annexure B order on the ground that he committed default of not surrendering his passport after the extended period of six months. The co- accused have been allowed to go abroad vide Annexure C and Crl.MC.No.7120 OF 2019 (H) 3 2020/KERID9 D orders. The petitioner submitted that he is employed abroad and his not reaching there on time will result in loosing of his employment and that the rules pertains to employment is very strict in Saudi Arabia, where he is employed. The petitioner did not appear on time, but nevertheless, subsequently surrendered his passport. It is also pertinent to note that he had applied for an extension of time, when he could not appear within the stipulated time, but that was disallowed by the court. The non-appearance of the petitioner does not appears to be a wanton act of breach. Considering the fact that the trial has not yet began, I am of the opinion that the petitioner can be permitted to go abroad for a further period of four months on certain stringent conditions. He is directed to deposit a sum of Rs.one lakh before the trial court and in case he fails to appear before the stipulated time of four months, the said amount shall be forfeited. On these conditions, the passport of the petitioner shall be released for a period of four months from the date of release of the passport.
