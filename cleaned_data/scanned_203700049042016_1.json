Dated this the 3\" day of August, 2016 ORDER The petitioner herein is the 1* accused in C.C.No.1257/2013 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Paravoor arising from Crime No.71/2001 for offences punishable under Sections 323, 341, 498A and 34 of IPC. 2. The wife of the petitioner herein filed a complaint alleging matrimonial cruelty against the petitioner herein and the in-laws. After investigation, final report was laid and the matter is pending as C.C.No.391/2001. Since the petitioner herein was not available for trial, the other accused faced the trial and they were acquitted. The case against the petitioner herein was split up and is now pending as C.C.No.1257/2013. 3. The petitioner claims that, he was employed abroad and was out of station in connection with his employment. He contends that, he has never ran away from the jurisdiction of the court and is ready and willing to surrender before the competent court. However, his apprehension is that, if an application for bail is filed, it is not likely to be taken up on the same day and he is likely to be remanded. ee 2016/KER/33891 Cri. M. C. No. 4904 of 2016 2 Having regard to the limited prayer now sought, | am inclined to grant the relief to the petitioner. Hence, the Crl.M.C. is disposed of with a direction that in the event of the petitioner herein surrendering before the court below and filing an application for bail, the same shall be considered by the court below on the same day, having regard to the facts of the case. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE. Pn"
