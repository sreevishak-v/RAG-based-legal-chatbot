SRI. S.SAJJU, SR.PP THIS CRIMINAL REVISION PETITION HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 07.01.2020, ALONG WITH Crl.MC.6176/2019(B), THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Bape ial Cr1.M.C No.6176/2019 2020/KERIA35 & Crl.R.P. No.752 of 2019 3 COMMON ORDER Dated this the 7th day of January 2020 Petitioner is the 1% accused in CC No.1211/2018 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-III, Thiruvananthapuram for having allegedly committed offences punishable under Sections 120B, 116, 468 and 511 of 420 IPC r/w Section 34 of IPC. 2. The allegation in brief against the petitioner and other accused is that they had hatched a conspiracy to manipulate the lottery drawing machines of the lottery department of Government of Kerala and that the 2 accused at the instigation of the 1* accused, who is the petitioner herein offered money to the de facto complainant for setting the last three digits of lottery drawing machine in a particular manner, which was already set and thereby attempted manipulating the machine. 3. The petitioner had approached the trial court with CMP No.670/2019 seeking a discharge. The learned Magistrate vide impugned order dated 25.04.2019 at Annexure A5 in Crl.M.C. No.6176/2019 found that the prayer was allowed in part and the Bape ial Cr1.M.C No.6176/2019 2020/KER/35 & Crl1.R.P. No.752 of 2019 4 petitioner was exonerated the offences punishable under Sections 120B and 116 of IPC, whereas charge was directed to be framed under Sections 511 of 420 and 511 of 468 r/w Section 34 of IPC. Aggrieved by the said order of not discharging him completely, the petitioner filed Crl.R.P. No.752/2019 and also filed Crl.M.C No.6176/2019 for quashing the proceedings under Section 482 of CrP.C. Both these petitions were considered together. 4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as also the learned Senior Public Prosecutor in detail and perused the records, I find that the court below was justified in passing the order retaining the case against the petitioner for offences punishable under Sections 511 of 420 and 511 of 468 fr/w Section 34 IPC. At the stage of framing of charge and quashing of proceedings, it is not the appropriate time to either go through the documents or the statements of the witnesses in detail. The specific case against the petitioner is that he had instigated the 2\" accused to manipulate the machine. Whether he actually instigated the 2\"? accused or not is something which is to be proved by the prosecution during the course of evidence. Going by the allegations alone, the offences are Pare hl Cr1.M.C No.6176/2019 2020/KERIA35 & Crl1.R.P. No.752 of 2019 5 attracted. It is not possible for this Court either at the time of framing of charge, or at the time of quashing the proceedings as required under Section 482 of CrP.C., to consider these minute details in the evidence that may be adduced. The statement of the witnesses cannot be gone into detail to conclude regarding the complicity of petitioner. 5. Under the circumstances, I am not convinced by the arguments placed by the learned counsel for the petitioner either to quash the proceedings or to interfere with the impugned order of the Magistrate not discharging the petitioner for offences punishable under Sections 511 of 420 and 511 of 468 r/w Section 34 IPC. In the result, Crl.R.P. No.752/2019 as well as Crl.M.C No.6176/2019 are not sustainable. While dismissing both these petitions, the learned Magistrate is directed to expedite the trial of CC No.1211/2018 for the reason that the petitioner is anxious to prove himself innocent in the matter and actually claims himself to be a whistle blower, than an accused.
