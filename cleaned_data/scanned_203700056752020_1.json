CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 04.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Crl.MC.No.5675 OF 2020 (H) LoB.. 202 /KER/TIA ORDER Dated this the 4th day of January 2021 Petitioners are the accused in Crime No.831/2019 registered at the Nadakkavu Police Station for offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 323, 324 r/w 149 of IPC, now pending as C.C.No.3/2020 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-IV, Kozhikode. The de _ facto complainant and the other persons injured are arrayed as respondents 3 to 5. Annexures-A3 to Ad affidavits have been filed by the said respondents stating that the dispute, which was the reason for the incident and registration of the crime, has been resolved amicably and they no subsisting grievance against the petitioners. Crl1.MC.No.5675 OF 2020 (H) AL, 202UKERILI4 2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also, who, on instructions, submits that the petitioners have no criminal antecedents. 3. Having considered the gravity of the offences alleged, nature of the injury caused and having perused the affidavits filed by respondents 3 to 5, the contents of which are submitted to be true and voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled and no public interest is involved in this matter. The fact that both petitioners as well as the de facto complainants were students is also taken into consideration. Moreover, in view of the settlement, possibility of the criminal proceedings ending in conviction is remote. As such, continuance of the proceedings will amount to an abuse of process of court and hence, in view of the legal position set out by the Honourable Supreme Court in Madan Crl1.MC.No.5675 OF 2020 (H) Be, 202UKERILI4 Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC 982] and Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is no impediment in granting the relief sought. In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. The proceedings in C.C.No.3/2020 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-IV, Kozhikode is quashed.
