Muraleedharan Nair, S/o Vasudevan Pillai, Radhalayam, Valiyayila Thottuvaram, Chirayinkeezhu P.O, Thiruvananthapuram By Advocate:-P.G. Saiju Counter Petitioners:- 1. The Station House Officer, Chirayinkeezhu Police Station 2. State of Kerala By Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumary This petition came up for hearing on 03/03/2025 and the court on 04/03/2025 passed the following : ORDER This is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail. Criminal M.C.No.622/2025 1/7 2. The petitioners are alleged to have committed the offences punishable under Sections 115(2), 118(1), 74, 76 and 324(2), r/w Section 3(5) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, and Crime No. 132/2025 of Chirayinkeezhu Police Station is registered against the petitioners arraying them as accused Nos. 1 and 3. 3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- On 31.01.2025 at about 12 Noon, the 3 accused, who is the neighbour of the defacto complainant, obstructed the way leading to the house of the defacto complainant, by fixing barbed wire fence. When the relative of the defacto complainant Sri.Ramachandran Nair questioned the same, the 4\" accused threw a stone towards him, accused Nos.4 and 5 fisted on his back, the 1% accused kicked him down, the 2\" accused beat him with an iron bucket, and accused Nos.1, 3, 4 and 5 beat him, and when the defacto complainant attempted to prevent the same, the 2 accused caught hold of her hair, and the 1* accused, by using an iron bucket, beat her. At that time, the granddaughter of the defacto complainant came there and helped the defacto complainant to get up, the 2\"! accused caught hold of her hair, and the 1 accused beat and fisted her and tore her dress. In the incident, the relative of the defacto complainant Sri.Ramachandran Nair lost his mobile phone, causing a loss of Rs.1,700/-. Criminal M.C.No.622/2025 2/7 4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The Investigating Officer filed report opposing the anticipatory bail application. 5. Heard. Perused the records. 6. The only point to be considered is, whether an order of anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioners/accused Nos. 1 and 3. 7. The Point: The 2 petitioner/ 3 accused is the uncle of 1* petitioner / 1* accused. The defacto complainant is the neighbour of the petitioners. The petitioners along with the other accused are alleged to have assaulted the defacto complainant, her grand daughter and her relative. The motive alleged is the animosity due to a dispute between the defacto complainant and the petitioners in connection with the pathway, leading to the house of the defacto complainant. 8. The petitioners submitted that, the defacto complainant is residing on the immediate southern side of the property owned by the 2 petitioner, and for the ingress and egress of the defacto complainant and her family members, a pathway having an extent of 3 links is located on the south-eastern side of the said property. It is submitted that, on several times, the defacto complainant and her men tried to extend the width of the pathway, and the defacto complainant also obstructed the construction of boundary wall, separating the pathway and the Criminal M.C.No.622/2025 3/7 property of the 2 petitioner. The petitioners also submitted that, on 30.12.2024, while the family members were engaged in fencing the boundary of the said property, the defacto complainant along with one Ramachandran Nair reached there and threw away the boundary stone and the iron fencing, and attacked the petitioners and they sustained injuries in the incident and took treatment from various hospitals, and thereafter, a false case has been foisted against the petitioners. According to the petitioners, they are innocent of the allegations levelled against them and they have not committed any offence as alleged. 9. There is serious allegation as against the petitioners. However, it is significant to note that the alleged incident occurred in view of a civil dispute. It is seen from the First Information Statement given by the defacto complainant that, on the alleged date of incident, the 3 accused had attempted to construct a fence obstructing the pathway towards the house of the defacto complainant and as per the request of the defacto complainant, the brother of the daughter-in-law of the defacto complainant by name Ramachandran came for her help, and thereafter, the alleged incident occurred. The petitioners counsel submitted that, in fact, the defacto complainant and the other person rushed into the spot, while the 2\" petitioner/ 3 accused and his family members were engaged in fencing their boundary and the petitioners were manhandled by them. According to the Criminal M.C.No.622/2025 Al7 petitioners, the defacto complainant and the said Ramachandran had attacked the petitioners, causing severe injuries to the 1* petitioner and injuries to the 2 petitioner. Along with the bail application, the petitioners had produced their treatment records from Taluk Head Quarters Hospital, Chirayinkeezhu. It is also submitted by the petitioners counsel that, though a complaint was given by the petitioners, it was not registered. The petitioners counsel further submitted that, the defacto complainant had obstructed the construction of boundary wall separating the pathway and their property, and that the 2\" petitioner had filed a caveat petition before the Munsiff Court, Attingal as Caveat No. 3/2025. Apparently, civil disputes are pending between the two. In view of the persisting civil dispute and boundary dispute, it appears that, an exaggeration of the case or fabrication of the case cannot be ruled out. The learned Public Prosecutor submitted that, it is these petitioners, who caused injuries to the victim Ramachandran Nair. However, it is relevant to note that there was an altercation between the two teams in view of the boundary dispute, and there is likelihood of causing injuries in the said altercation. The involvement of the petitioners in the alleged offence is a matter of evidence. It would be a travesty of justice, if the petitioners are put behind the bars, if actually no offence is committed by them. There is every possibility that the case is filed against them only to humiliate or Criminal M.C.No.622/2025 5/7 harass the petitioners in view of the boundary dispute. So it appears that this is a fit case where an order of pre-arrest bail can be granted to the petitioners. In the result, the petition is allowed on the following conditions:- (1) In the event of arrest, the petitioners/accused Nos. 1 and 3 shall be released on bail on their executing bond for Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) each with two solvent sureties for the like sum each to the satisfaction of the arresting officer/Investigating Officer, as the case may be. (2) Petitioners shall appear before the Investigating Officer between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. on every Thursday for a period of 3 (three) months or till the filing of the final report, whichever is earlier. (3) Petitioners shall also appear before the Investigating Officer as and when required. (4) Petitioners shall not commit any offence while on bail. (5) Petitioners shall not attempt to contact the defacto complainant or any of the prosecution witnesses, directly or through any other person, or in any other way try to tamper with the evidence or influence any witnesses or other persons related to the investigation. Criminal M.C.No.622/2025 6/7 In case of any violation of the above conditions or misuse of liberty, the prosecution or the defacto complainant is at liberty to approach jurisdictional court for cancellation of bail.
