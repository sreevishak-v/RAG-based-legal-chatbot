It is also submitted that an offence under Section 380 of IPC is compoundable whereas Section 457 is non compoundable. The allegation is that the petitioners committed theft of 5 kg of copper roll worth %500/-. Itis submitted that now, the matter has been settled. 3.1 have heard the learned Public Prosecutor as well as the learned counsel for the defacto complainant. Pe ia s016ikERISS577 Crl.M.C. No. 9082 of 2016 4.Learned counsel for the defacto complainant also submitted before me that the matter is actually settled. 5.Surely, Section 457 is a non compoundable offence. At the very same time, considering the totality of the case and further keeping in mind that the matter has been settled, I feel that the proceedings can be quashed by exercising the power vested upon this Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Hence, the proceedings in CC No.1127/2015 on the file of the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Ernakulam is hereby quashed. 6.The Crl.M.C. is disposed of, as above. Sd/- K.P.
