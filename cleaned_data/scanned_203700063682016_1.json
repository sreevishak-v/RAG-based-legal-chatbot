RESPONDENT (S)' EXHIBITS NIL //TRUE COPY// P.S.TO JUDGE Msv/ 2016/KER/42229 SUNIL THOMAS, J. Dated this the 3\" day of October, 2016 ORDER The petitioners are the accused in Crime No.296/2014 of Kudiyanmala Police Station, Kannur District for offences punisable under Sections 452, 341, 323, 294(b), 354 read with 34 IPC. 2. The allegation of the prosecution is that, on 10.07.2014 at 8.30 p.m., the petitioners trespassed into the house of the defacto complainant and pulled her towards the varanda. When CW2 tried to obstruct the petitioners, the accused hit them and the 1* petitioner caught hold of her hand thereby affecting her modesty. Other accused have also committed various specific overt acts. On the basis of the complaint lodged, crime was registered. After investigation final report was laid. Cognizance was taken and the matter is now pending as C.C.No.1344/2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Taliparamba. 3. The petitioners have now approached this Court stating that, the disputes between the parties have been voluntarily and amicably settled. The defacto complainant is stated to have no further grievance as against the petitioners. A joint petition has 2016/KER/42229 Cri. M. C. No. 6368 of 2016 2 been filed by the petitioners and the respondents 2 to 4 jointly stating that, the parties have settled their disputes. Separate affidavits have also been filed by the respondents 3 and 4, wherein they have reiterated the settlement arrived at and also expressed their mind that they do not propose to pursue the matter. 4. Learned Public Prosecutor on instructions submitted that the petitioners herein are not involved in any other crime and the information is that, the parties have resolved their disputes. 5. Having regard to these, | am satisfied that the dispute is essentially a private one and does not involve any larger public interest. In the light of the settlement, interest of justice demands that further continuation of the proceedings should be given a premature end to. Hence, | am inclined to allow the prayer sought for. Hence, Crl.M.C. is allowed. All further proceedings in C.C.No.1344/2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Taliparamba stand quashed. Sd/- : SUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE. n"
