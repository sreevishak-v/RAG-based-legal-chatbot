Dated this the 19\" day of January, 2024 ORDER The first petitioner is the registered owner of a tipper lorry bearing register No. KL-24-B-6817 while the 24 petitioner is the owner of lorry bearing No.KL-23-D-2520. Both the above vehicles were seized by the 3% respondent on 08-01-2024 alleging offences punishable under Sections 4(]) and 21 of the Kerala Minor Mineral (Regulation of Development) Act 1957 (for short, the Act). However, the said seizure has not been reported to the learned Magistrate under Section 102 of Cr.P.C and instead has been reported to the 3 respondent, who is the Competent Officer under the Act. 2. Sri-Ajith Murali, the learned counsel for the petitioner, contended that the failure to report the seizure to the Magistrate is contrary to law and that the 3rd respondent ought to have reported the same. 3. In the decision in Crl.M.C.No.1484/2023, this Court considered the question as to whether the seizure ought to be reported to the Magistrate. After observing that there are no contrary provisions in the Act as against Section 102 Cr.P.C., it oe 2024/KER/4156 CRL.MC NO. 284 OF 2024 3 was observed that the Police Officers are bound to report the factum of seizure without delay to the Magistrate. 4. The seizure of the two vehicles have not been reported to the Magistrate yet and the 3 respondent is bound to do so as per law. 5. Accordingly, there will be a direction to the 3 respondent to report the seizure of vehicle Nos. KL-24-B-6817 and No.KL-23-D-2520 to the jurisdictional Magistrate, as expeditiously as possible, at any rate, within a period of 48 hours from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment. The Crl.M.C.is disposed of.
