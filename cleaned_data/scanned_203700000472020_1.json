CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 07.01.2020, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: ae Bae 2020/KER/337 Crl.MC.No.47 OF 2020 (E) 2 ORDER Dated this the 7th day of January 2020 The petitioners were released on bail by the Sessions Court on condition that they shall appear before the investigating officer on every Saturday between 9 a.m and 10 a.m. 2. Subsequently, the petitioners had approached this Court for quashing of the proceedings and vide order at Annexure - Ad, it was directed by this Court that the investigation could continue. But the final report has to be filed after seeking permission of this Court. 3. Subsequently, the petitioners had approached the Sessions Court for modification of the direction regarding the appearance before the investigating officer on every Saturday. The order was modified to the effect that they shall appear before the investigating 2020/KER/337 Crl.MC.No.47 OF 2020 (E) 3 officer on every second Saturday. That order at Annexure A-6 is challenged before this Court. Considering the facts that the final report has to be filed only after getting permission of this Court, I find that the direction to appear before the investigating officer on every second Saturday is not very relevant and necessary. The petitioners shall appear before the investigating officer as and when called for. The impugned order is modified to that effect. The Crl1.M.C is disposed of as above.
