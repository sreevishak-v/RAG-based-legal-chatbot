ANNEXURE-B ; AFFIDAVIT OF THE 1ST RESPONDENT. RESPONDENT(S)' ANNEXURES NIL True Copy// P.A. To Judge Bb asa 2017/KER/49300 SUNIL THOMAS, J. Crl.M.C.No.7487 of 2017. Dated this the 06\" day of December, 2017 ORDER The petitioner herein is the sole accused in S.C.No.186/2013 of Additional District and Sessions Court-I, Thalassery, for offence punishable under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code. 2. The allegation of the prosecution is that the petitioner herein, who got acquainted with the first respondent/de facto complainant sometime in the year 2010, offered to marry her and on the basis of the promise to marry, had physical relationship with her at various places. Thereafter, he retracted from the promise and consequently, the first respondent laid a complaint, alleging offence punishable under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code. After investigation, final report was asa 2017/KER/49300 Crl.M.C.No.7487 of 2017 : 2: laid and the matter is now pending as S.C.No.186/2013 of Additional District and Sessions Court-I, Thalassery. The petitioner has approached this Court, contending that they got married on 05.05.2014 under the Special Marriage Act and that hence, the parties do not intend to prosecute the matter any further. To substantiate it, the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned counsel for the respondents relied on Annexure B affidavit affirmed by the first respondent, reiterating the settlement. 3. Since the allegations are serious and that it involves an offence punishable under Section 376 of the IPC, the learned counsel for the petitioner was directed to advance arguments on merits. The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that, even in the complaint, there is no specific allegation that the petitioner herein had made a false promise. It was stated by the learned counsel for the petitioner that both parties had physical relationship at various hotels which militates against the asa 2017/KER/49300 Crl.M.C.No.7487 of 2017 : 3: allegation of forceful rape. It was contended that it can only be considered as a physical relationship between two persons who were in deep love. To substantiate it, the learned counsel for the petitioner relied on the decisions reported in Deelip Singh Alias Dilip Kumar Vs. State of Bihar [(2005) 1 Supreme Court Cases 88], Uday Vs. State of Karnataka [(2003) 4 Supreme Court Cases 46] and Kaini Rajan Vs. State of Kerala [(2013) 9 Supreme Court Cases 113]. It was contended that in the light of the above decisions, the very basis that there was a false promise to marry cannot survive. It was also contended that, this is reinforced by the subsequent marriage between the parties and even assuming that there was any false promise by the petitioner herein, that stands condoned by _ the subsequent conduct of the parties. It was further contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the allegation of false promise cannot also survive based on the fact that they started courting each other in the 2017/KER/49300 Crl.M.C.No.7487 of 2017 : 4: year 2010. But, the first instance of physical relationship was allegedly in the year 2012. This also militates against the allegation of false promise. 4. Evidently, the complaint do not disclose a specific allegation that at the time of the initial promise, the petitioner herein had a mala fide intention. This is reinforced by their subsequent marriage. The learned Public Prosecutor also submitted that the matter has been settled between the parties and a copy of the marriage certificate was produced in open court. 5. Having considered these facts, I am inclined to hold that prosecution under Section 376 is difficult to survive. After having entered into the matrimonial relationship, it cannot be expected that the first respondent herein will stand by her allegations in the FIS at the time of trial. Evidently, the prosecution can only be a futile exercise. Hence, I am inclined to invoke the jurisdiction under Section 482 of Cr.PC. to quash the entire proceedings. Be aa i ae asa 2017/KER/49300 Crl.M.C.No.7487 of 2017 : 5: The Criminal Miscellaneous Case is accordingly allowed. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS JUDGE Bb/08/12/2017 [True copy] P.A to Judge"
