CriLM.C.No.69 of 2024 Dated this the 22\" day of January, 2024 ORDER Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C to quash all proceedings against him. 2. Petitioner is the sole accused in C.C.No.632/2023 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kalamassery arising out of Crime No.967/2023 of Kalamassery Police Station, Ernakulam District, registered for the offences under Sections 294(b), 427 and 392 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The 3% respondent is the defacto complainant. 3. According to the prosecution, the accused by inflicting bodily harm abused the defacto complainant and destroyed mobile phones kept in the shop and thereby committed the offences alleged. 4. Heard the learned Counsel for the petitioner and the learned Counsel for the respondent apart from the learned Public Prosecutor. 5. The learned Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the matter has been settled and hence the proceedings against the petitioner ought to be quashed. It was also submitted that, considering the nature of offences alleged, no purpose would be served by continuing the proceedings. 6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303], pone 2024/KER/7204 CRL.MC NO. 69 OF 2024 3 the Apex Court has held that in appropriate cases, the High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. This view was reiterated in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466] and Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State of Jharkhand and Another [(2014) 9 SCC 653]. 7. | have perused Annexure A4 affidavit filed by the 3 respondent. The learned Public Prosecutor has submitted that upon verification, it is understood that the affidavit is genuine, and the defacto complainant stands by the contents thereof. | am satisfied that the matter has been settled and no public interest is involved in this case. There is no impediment for granting the prayer for quashing. The continuance of the proceedings will only be an exercise in futility. 8. Accordingly, all proceedings against the petitioner in C.C.No0.632/2023 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kalamassery, are quashed. This Crl.M.C is allowed. sd/ BECHU KURIAN THOMAS JUDGE jrm/ Oo ES A eee petra: bh} A fect Baa 2024/KER/7204 CRL.MC NO. 69 OF 2024 4 APPENDIX OF CRL.MC 69/2024 PETITIONER ANNEXURES Annexure At CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FIR IN CRIME NO. 967/2023 OF KALAMASSERY POLICE STATION DATED 18.05,20232 Annexure A2 CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT IN CRIME NO. 967/2023 OF KALAMASSERY POLICE STATION DATED 1.6.2023 Annexure A3 TRUE COPY OF WOUND CERTIFICATE DATED 18.5,.2023 Annexure A4 AFFIDAVIT DATED 27.12.2023 SWORN TO BY THE 3RD RESPONDENT"
