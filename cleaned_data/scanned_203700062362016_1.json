RESPONDENT (S)' EXHIBITS:NIL True Copy / P A to Judge eee 2017/KER/952 SUNIL THOMAS, J. Crl.M.C.No.6236 of 2016 Dated this the 9\" day of January, 2017 ORDER Petitioner herein is the accused in Annexure-A2 FIR for proceeding under section 107 Cr.P.C. The reason stated in Annexure-A2 FIR is that the petitioner herein indulges in criminal activities affecting the public order and hence for preventing him from committing such acts, bail may be taken from him. This is challenged in this Crl.M.C. 2. Evidently, Section 107Cr.P.C is contemplated as an independent proceeding by itself. It cannot prima facie be the subject matter of registering the FIR . Having regard to this, I am inclined to quash Crime No.691 of 2016 of Sasthamcotta Police Station. It is made clear that this will not bar the respondents from initiating independent proceedings under section 107Cr.P.C. In the result, Crl.M.C is allowed. All further proceedings arising from Crime No.691 of 2016 of Sasthamcotta Police Station stand quashed. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS Judge Sbna/9/1/17 True Copy f P A to Judge"
