BY SRI.SASTHAMANGALAM S.AJITHKUMAR (SC FOR CBI) THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 07.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Crl.MC.No.8654/2018 2019/KERIO89 -: 26 ORDER The petitioner herein is the 2\" accused in C.C.48/2011 of the Special Court (SPE/CBI), Thiruvananthapuram, which is a prosecution brought by the CBI. After the examination of the prosecution witnesses, the accused were called upon to enter on defence. As required under Section 243 Cr.P.C., the petitioner submitted a list of witnesses, and requested the court to summon those witnesses. The list submitted by him contains four witnesses, and the list also explains the purpose for which each witness is sought to be examined. Of the four witnesses cited by the petitioner, two are serving or retired bank officials, and the 4 witness is a Chartered Accountant. The application filed by him as Crl.M.P.180/2018 was opposed by the CBI on the ground that examination of those witnesses unnecessarily would only delay the process, and defeat the ends of justice. Crl.MC.No.8654/2018 2019/KER/689 -: Bre 2. After hearing both sides, the learned trial Judge allowed examination of three of the defence witnesses, but disallowed the request for examination of the 4 witness as defence witness. Aggrieved by that part of the order dated 13.12.2018, disallowing examination of the Ath defence witness, the 2\" accused has come up before this Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C. 3. On hearing both sides, and on a perusal of the impugned order, and also the list of witnesses submitted by the petitioner before the trial court, I find that the object for which the 4 witness is sought to be examined can be achieved even otherwise, and that the request was rightly disallowed by the trial court. The 4 witness cited by the petitioner is a Chartered Accountant, and the purpose of his examination as a defence witness is to explain the banking procedure, including the procedure for sanctioning different types of loans. This procedure is covered by the circulars and Crl.MC.No.8654/2018 2019/KER/689 -: Are instructions issued by the bank authorities, and the Reserve Bank of India. The prosecution has already examined some bank officials. No doubt, the petitioner and the other accused must have thoroughly cross examined those witnesses on all issues, including the banking procedure, and also the procedure for sanctioning different types of loans. Any way, two more witnesses are being examined on the defence side also as bank officials. Tf at all the petitioner wants to bring out any clarification as regards banking procedure, that can be brought out through the examination of the witnesses 1 and 2 cited by him, and of course, he must have brought out the required materials through the cross examination of the prosecution witnesses also. 4. A Chartered Accountant is not expected to explain the banking procedure. He cannot be said to be an expert on the field. He can, of course, competently say about auditing and accounting. Crl.MC.No.8654/2018 2019/KER/689 -: 5 re Banking procedure, or the procedural formalities regarding different banking transactions will have to be explained by the competent persons, including bank officials. Such things cannot be brought out through a Chartered Accountant. That is why, the trial court disallowed the request to examine a chartered accountant for explaining banking procedure. I find that it was rightly done by the trial court. Any way, if at all the petitioner wants to bring out some clarification on the relevant issues or aspects as regards banking procedure or the sanctioning of loans, he can very well bring it through the defence witnesses cited by him. If at all he has omitted to put the necessary questions to the prosecution witnesses on the point, those witnesses can very well be recalled, if felt or found absolutely necessary. This cannot be done as of right. If such a request comes before the trial court, the depositions given by the bank officials on the side of the prosecution will have Crl.MC.No.8654/2018 2019/KER/689 -: Gre to be examined carefully and thoroughly by the trial court, and see whether those aspects sought to be clarified are already covered by the depositions given by the witnesses in cross examination. Tf those aspects are not already covered by the deposition given by the prosecution witnesses, and if the defence witnesses 1 and 2 are not able to explain such procedure with competence, the trial court can think of allowing the request to recall the prosecution witnesses under Section 311 Cr.P.C. With these observations, this Crl.M.c. is disposed of.
