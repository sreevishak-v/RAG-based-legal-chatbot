According to the petitioner, the first accused had done the entire acts, and he had pleaded guilty before the court below, and thereby he was convicted and sentenced. Further, according to the learned counsel for the petitioner, when the first accused has been convicted and sentenced, the continued prosecution of the petitioner in C.C.No.175 of 2009 is quite unnecessary. 3. The arguments forwarded by the learned counsel for PLease aa 2017/KER/49554 Cri.M.C. No.6938 of 2017 -2- the petitioner that the offences alleged against the petitioner are not legally sustainable against the petitioner, does not seem to be correct. If the allegations are true, it may invite the offences alleged. The present stage is to premature to conclude that the petitioner has not committed the offences alleged against him. Being an old matter, the court below shall take up the matter out of turn and shall dispose it of, expeditiously, at any rate within a period of six months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. With the said direction, this Crl.M.C. is dismissed. Sd/- B.KEMAL PASHA JUDGE Scl/07.12.2017"
