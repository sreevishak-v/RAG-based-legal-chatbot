NOUSHAD K.A. (PP) THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 10.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: CRL.MC NO. 174 OF 2024 EPL BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J. ~ Cri.M.C. No.174 of 2024 Dated this the 10\" day of January, 2024 ORDER Petitioner challenges Annexure-Al order issued by the Judicial First Class Magjistrate-ll, Pathanamthitta directing transfer of S.T. No.2061 of 2019 to the Judicial First Class Magistrate-IIl, Pathanamthitta, pursuant to the order of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Pathanamthitta withdrawing the case and making it over to the Judicial First Class Magjistrate-lll, Pathanamthitta. 2. Smt. Vijayakumari R, the learned counsel for the petitioner, vehemently contended that, S.T. Nos.2061 of 2019 and 2062 of 2019 are proceedings under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act (for short the N.I.Act ) and arose out of the same cause of action, and in view of the judgment in Yogesh Upadhyay and Another v. Atlanta Ltd (AIR 2023 SCC 1151) the cases are to be tried together and therefore, transfer of one case by itself is prejudicial to the contentions of 2024/KER/2902 CRL.MC NO. 174 OF 2024 the accused. It is further submitted that, if the trial of one case alone is carried out, there could be possibility of contradictory findings, and therefore, it is only appropriate that both cases are tried together and unless Annexure-Al order is set aside and S.T. No.2061 of 2019 is retained on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate-ll], Pathanamthitta, petitioner could be put to prejudice. 3. | have heard the arguments of Sri. Noushad K.A., learned Public Prosecutor as well. 4. In the decision in Yogesh Upadhyays case supra, the Supreme Court had observed that, since the six complaint cases pertain to the same transactions, it would be advisable to have a common adjudication to obviate the possibility of contradictory findings being rendered in connection therewith by different courts. The word used by the Supreme Court in the aforesaid judgment is advisable and not mandatory . 5. On a perusal of the impugned order it is revealed that, the same was issued on 28.03.2023 and the petitioner was directed to appear before the Judicial First Class Magistrate-lll, Pathanamthitta, on 19.04.2023. In all probabilities, the petitioner Pls Bl nie aa 2024/KER/2902 CRL.MC NO. 174 OF 2024 .-4,. would have appeared before the said court without any objection. After acquiescing into Annexure-Al order and participating in the proceedings for the last 8 months, it is not proper to now turn around, on the eve of the trial of the case, to challenge the said order of transfer. Considering the above circumstances and the delay in challenging Annexure-Al order, | am of the view that, this is not a fit case to interfere under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. Accordingly, this Criminal Miscellaneous case is dismissed.
