No, 2491 of 2015 Dated this the 21* day of April, 2015. ORDER The petitioner is the second accused in Crime No.446 of 2010 of Thrissur Town East Police Station registered for the offence punishable under Sections 448, 323, 506(1) r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code, which is now pending as L.P.No.52 of 2012 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Thrissur. 2. In this petition, it is stated that the petitioner was enlarged on bail during the crime stage and subsequently after the appearance before the court below, he was enlarged on bail. Thereafter, the petitioner got an employment abroad and therefore he could not appear before the court below when summons was issued to him. Consequently, his bail bond was cancelled and a non bailable warranted was issued against him. Now the case against the first accused stands posted to 2.5.2015. Epes Shed) is rae reg 2015/KER/17261 Cri.M.C. No. 2491 of 2015 -~2- 3. Though he is willing to appear before the court below, he reasonably apprehends that his bail application will not be considered by the court below on the date of his appearance itself and he may be remanded to Judicial Custody, pending consideration of the bail application. 4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner. 5. The learned counsel for the petitioner urged for a direction to the learned magistrate to consider the application on the date of his appearance itself. I do not think that the Learned Magistrate will adopt such a method mechanically without application of mind to see that the petitioner is incarcerated. However, to secure the interest of Justice, the learned Magistrate is directed to dispose of the bail application on the date of appearance itself. Sd/- K. HARILAL JUDGE Scl. True Copy PA to Judge."
