ORDER Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.294/2015 of Alathur Police Station. He is the Secretary of the Society by mame Brahmananda Swami Sivayogi Educational Society (the Society for short) registered under the Societies Registration Act. He is granted with an anticipatory bail. But he is aggrieved by condition No.3 in the order granting pre-arrest bail. According to the petitioner, being the Secretary of the Society, which is being functioned in the premises of the school, the condition No.3 prohibiting his entry into the premises of BSS Sidhasramam or at the premises of BSS Gurukulam HSS is illegal, irrational and liable to be deleted. His position as the Secretary of the Society is evidenced by Annexure-II order issued by the District Registrar. But as per condition No.3 of the impugned order he Bae 2015/KER/17252 Crl.M.C.1989/15-C :2: cannot enter into the Society enabling him to discharge the duties as the Secretary of the Society. 2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor. 3. Indisputably, the petitioner is the Secretary of the Society, as the same is evidenced by Annexure-II order. If that be so, he has the right to enter into the Society, which is being functioned in the premises of the school and he cannot be prevented from exercising that right. Having regard to the said facts, condition No.3 in the impugned order will stand modified to the extent that the petitioner is allowed to enter into the office of the Society only, which is being functioned in the premises of the above school: but he cannot enter into Sidhasramam or BSS gurukulam HSS. This petition is disposed of. sd/- (K.HARILAL, JUDGE) okb."
