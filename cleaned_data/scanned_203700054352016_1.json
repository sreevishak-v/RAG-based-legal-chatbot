TO JUDGE Pn Bl esas 2017/KER/49761 SUNIL THOMAS, J. Cri. M. C. Nos. 5435 of 2016 & 6969 of 2017 Dated this the 8 day of December, 2017 ORDER The petitioner herein who is the respondent in M.C. No.842/2010 of the Family Court, Tirur suffered an order of maintenance under Sections 125(3) and 128 of Cr.P.C. In execution proceedings, the petitioner was brought under arrest and by Annexures A2 and A3 orders, the court below on the date of his surrender noted that he has committed default and ordered him to be detained for separate specified periods mentioned in Annexures A2 and A3. This is assailed in Crl.M.C. No.5435/2016. The petitioner was ordered to be released by the order of this Court dated 26.08.2016 relying on the decisions reported in Abdulrahiman v. State of Kerala (2011 (4) KLT 124) and Mohandas V. Jayanthi (2012 (3) KLT 43) on a premise that the petitioner was ordered to be detained without compliance of the statutory formalities. 2. Cri.M.C. No.6969/2017 arises from the order in Crl.M.P. No.457/2016 in M.C. No.842/2010. In that also, the petitioner was brought under arrest finding that the petitioner has committed default of 13 months and he was ordered detention of 15 days for Bl esas 2017/KER/49761 Cri. M. C. Nos. 5435 of 2016 & 6969 of 2017 each months default. This is the subject matter of Crl.M.C. No.6969/2017. In that, by order dated 11.10.2017, the petitioner was ordered to be released on the same reason as mentioned in connected Crl.M.C. 3. |The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that, the court should have conducted an enquiry as to whether petitioner herein has committed any default without any reason. This was considered by this Court in the above said decisions. Necessarily, the court is bound to conduct an enquiry into that. 4. The petitioner has a further case that the applications for execution are barred by limitation, in so far as it relates to the period beyond one year from the due date. To buttress that argument, the learned counsel for the petitioner relied on the decisions reported in Abdulrahiman's case and Mohandas' case as well as Ali.C and others V. State of Kerala and Others (2013 (4) KHC 871). 5. Having regard to the above two contentions taken up by the learned counsel for the petitioner, | am inclined to set aside Annexures A2 and A3 orders in Crl.M.C. No.5435/2016 and Annexure A2 in Crl.M.C. No.6969/2017. The matters are remitted esas 2017/KER/49761 Cri. M. C. Nos. 5435 of 2016 & 6969 of 2017 back to the court below to consider, in the light of the decisions referred to the above, whether there was default without any reason from the part of the petitioner herein. The court shall also consider the question whether the applications for execution in Cri.M.C. No.5435/2016 and in Crl.M.C. No. 6969/2017 are beyond the prescribed period under the statute. Any other preliminary objection raised by the petitioner herein shall also be raised by the court below. The court below shall thereafter proceed in accordance with law. Crl.M.Cs. are allowed to the above extent. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE. Pn"
