JUSTICE RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN V FRIDAY, THE O4TH DAY OF JANUARY 2019 / 14TH POUSHA, 1940 Cr1.MC.No. 6698 of 2018 MC NO.19/2016 ON THE FILES OF THE JUDICIAL FIRST CLASS MAGISTRATE COURT-I, CHITTUR DATED 06-10-2018 PETITIONER/RESPONDENT: RAJESH, AGED 38 YEARS, S/O.SHIVANANDAN, CHITOOR TALUK, KODUMBU VILLAGE, CHITOOR. BY ADV. SRI.C.DHEERAJ RAJAN RESPONDENT / PETITIONER: PRIYANKA, AGED 21 YEARS, D/O.GANESH, GANESH NIVAS, CHITOOR TALUK, THATHAMANGALAM VILLAGE, PALAKKAD DISTRICT. THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 04.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: 2019/KER/305 Crl.MC.No. 6698 of 2018 2 ORDER The petitioner herein is the respondent in M.C. No.19 of 2016 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court No.1, Chitoor. The said case has been initiated by the respondent herein before under the provisions of the Protection of Women from the Domestic Violence Act, 2005. 2. The petitioner filed an application to summon a witness and by order dated 15.9.2018, the said application was allowed by the learned Magistrate. It is evident from Annexure-A6 that the case was posted to 16.10.2018 and the petitioner was ordered to take steps. On 6.10.2018, as the witness summoned did not appear, the learned Magistrate proceeded to close the evidence and posted the matter for hearing. 3. Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor. 4. Essentially, the contention advanced by the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner is that the learned Magistrate 2019/KER/305 Crl.MC.No. 6698 of 2018 3 was not justified in not granting the petitioner an opportunity to let in evidence. 5. As to what prompted the learned Magistrate to abruptly post the matter for hearing is not discernible from the order. Where a person fails to appear before the Court in spite of the service of summons on him, the Magistrate has to take steps for securing the presence of the witness under Section 87 of the Code. 6. For the aforementioned reason, the order dated 6.10.2018 closing the evidence is set aside. The learned Magistrate is directed to secure the presence of the witness summoned by the petitioner as per law and afford an opportunity to the petitioner to let in evidence. With the above said direction, this petition is disposed of.
