SRI.R.RANJITH (MANJERTI) RESPONDENTS/STATE & DEFACTO COMPLAINANT : 1 THE STATE OF KERALA, REPRESENTED BY THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR, HIGH COURT OF KERALA, ERNAKULAM, KOCHI FOR THE SUB INSPECTOR OF POLICE TIRUR POLICE STATION, MALAPPURAM DISTRICT. 2 VICTIM BY ADV. NIDHIN KUMAR A.P. SRI B JAYASURYA PP THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 04.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: _ Bis 2019/KER/340 Cr1.MC.No. 8093 of 2018 2 ORDER The petitioner is a handicapped man and is a singer of some repute. He faces accusation of having committed offence under Sections 376(2)(n) and 506 of the IPC, and Section 67(A) of the Information Technology Act, 2002, in S.C. No.1090 of 2017 on the file of the Additional Sessions Court-I, Manjeri. 2. The 2\" respondent, who was a married woman and the mother of three children, lodged a complaint before the police on 02.01.2016 alleging that the petitioner herein, by threatening that her explicit photographs would be circulated online, induced her to have a sexual relationship with him. She was subjected to rape in her house and in a hotel at Ooty in the year 2015. The crime was investigated and final report was laid before the jurisdictional court. 3. The above criminal proceedings are sought to be quashed by invoking the inherent powers of this Court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. 4. The 2 respondent, who is the de facto complainant, has filed an affidavit stating that she was in love with the petitioner _ Bis 2019/KER/340 Cr1.MC.No. 8093 of 2018 3 herein and when this fact came to the knowledge of her near relatives, they had forced her to lodge a complaint leveling false accusations. According to the 2 respondent, her former husband has divorced her and she has now married the petitioner herein. She would refer to Anneuxre-B certificate of marriage issued by the Marriage Officer, Tirur to substantiate her contention. She would also refer to Annexure-C affidavit sworn to by her and contended that the continuance of criminal proceedings is an abuse of process and would prove detrimental to her married life. 5. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner is a renowned singer and the 2\" respondent had fallen in love with him. When the matter came to the knowledge of her former husband, she was forced to lodge a complaint. Immediately thereafter, both parties divorced their respective spouses and have got married. 6. The learned Public Prosecutor was directed to get instructions. It is submitted that the investigating officer has recorded the statement of the victim and she has stated in clear terms that she has no grievance against the petitioner herein. _ Bis 2019/KER/340 Cr1.MC.No. 8093 of 2018 A 7. I have considered the submissions advanced and have perused the materials made available. 8. The legal position with regard to quashing of proceedings on the basis of compromise between the parties is by now well settled. It has been held that the power of the High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to a criminal Court for compounding the offences under Section 320 of the Code. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or FIR may be exercised where the offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the Court will have to give due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime. It is also settled that heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot quashed even though the victim or victim's family and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offenses are not private in nature and have serious impact on society. The directions of the Apex Court in Gian Singh v. State of _ Bis 2019/KER/340 Cr1.MC.No. 8093 of 2018 5 Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303] and in Narinder singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466 ] serve as guiding lights. 9. Insofar as the offence of rape is concerned, there cannot be any doubt that the same cannot be settled on the strength of a compromise arrived at between the victim and the accused. The Apex Court in State of M.P. v. Madan Lal [2015 (7) SCC 681], relying on the decision in Shimbhu_ and Another v. State _ of Haryana [2014 (13) SCC 318] has clearly reminded the Courts that rape is a non-compoundable offence and it is an offence against the society and is not a matter to be left for the parties to compromise and settle. This was because of the fact that the Court cannot always be assured that the consent given by the victim in compromising the case is a genuine consent. There is every chance that the victim might have been pressurised by the accused or the trauma undergone by her all the years might have compelled her to opt for a compromise. In such cases, the accused may use all his influence to pressurise the victim for a compromise. It was taking note of this aspect that it was held that it would not be safe in considering the compromise arrived at between the parties in rape cases. _ Bis 2019/KER/340 Cr1.MC.No. 8093 of 2018 6 10. However, in the instant case, it is borne out from the statement of the 2\"? respondent recorded by the investigating officer that the parties were in love and the Crime was registered due to the circumstances prevailing then. Annexure-B would show that the parties have married and they are living together as husband and wife. There is no case for anyone that the dignity of the 2\" respondent was violated by a wanton act of the petitioner. This is not one of those cases, wherein the allegations reek of extreme depravity, perversity or cruelty. It cannot be said that the offence in the instant case would fall in the category of offences that have a serious impact on society. In the peculiar facts of the instant case, grave hardship and inconvenience will be caused to the 2 respondent, if the prosecution is permitted to continue. She has also filed an affidavit stating that she is not desirous of prosecuting against her husband any further. In that view of the matter, the prospects of an ultimate conviction is remote and bleak even if the case is proceeded with. Furthermore, the 2\" respondent can continue with her life with dignity and respect. Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I am _ of the considered view that this is a fit case in which this Court will Ree Tal Baers 2019/KER/340 Cr1.MC.No. 8093 of 2018 7 be well justified in invoking its extraordinary powers under Section 482 of the Code to quash the proceedings. In the result this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-A Final report and all further proceedings pursuant thereto against the petitioner in SC No. 1090/2017 on the file of Additional Sessions Court-I, Manjeri are quashed.
