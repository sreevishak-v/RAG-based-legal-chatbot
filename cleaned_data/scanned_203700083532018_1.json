CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 07.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: a Crl.MC.No. 8353 of 2018 3 2019/KERIO44 ORDER This petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (the Code for brevity). 2. The 2\" respondent is the de facto complainant in C.C. No.1297 of 2012 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Chavakkad. The 1* petitioner is the husband and petitioners 2 and 3 are his parents. They are being proceeded against for having committed offence punishable under Section 406, 420 and 498A r/w. Section 34 of the IPC. 3. The instant petition is filed with a prayer to quash the proceedings on the ground of settlement of all disputes. The party respondents have filed separate affidavits stating that they have no subsisting grievance and they have no objection in terminating the criminal proceedings. 4. The learned Public Prosecutor on instructions submitted that the statement of the party respondents have been recorded and the State has no objection in terminating the proceedings as it involves no public interest. a Crl.MC.No. 8353 of 2018 4 2019/KER/644 5. I have considered the submissions advanced. 6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303] and in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466], the Apex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. Further in Jitendra Raghuvanshi & Others v. Babita Raghuvanshi & Another [(2013) 4 SCC 58], it was observed that it is the duty of the courts to encourage genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes. If the parties ponder over their faults and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual agreement instead of fighting it out in a court of Jaw, the courts should not hesitate to exercise its powers under Section 482 of the Code. Permitting such proceedings to continue would be nothing, but an abuse of process of court. The interest of justice also require that the proceedings be quashed. Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I am of the considered view that this Court will be well justified in invoking its extraordinary powers under Section 482 of the Code to quash the proceedings. In the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-A2 a Cr1.MC.No. 8353 of 2018 5 201/KERI644 final report and all proceedings pursuant thereto against the petitioners now pending as C.C.No.1297 of 2012 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Chavakkad are quashed.
