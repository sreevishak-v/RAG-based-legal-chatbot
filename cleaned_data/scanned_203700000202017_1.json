CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 04-01-2017, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: 2017/KER/227 SUNIL THOMAS, J. Crl.M.C.No.20 of 2017 Dated this the 4\" day of January, 2017 ORDER Petitioner herein is the sole accused in Crime No.1 of 2014 of Palakkad Excise Range for offence punishable under section 55(a) of the Abkari Act. 2. The allegation of the prosecution is that on 01.01.2014, the car belonging to the petitioner herein was found loaded with 168 liters of spirit and left abandoned. Crime was registered and matter is now pending as C.P.No.39 of 2016 of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-III, Palakkad. Petitioner submits that he was not arrested nor he was aware of the entire proceedings. Having come to know about the pendency of proceedings, he has approached this Court stating that he is ready and willing to appear before the court below and to seek his relief there. The apprehension of the petitioner is that in the event of his appearance, the court below may not consider the bail application on the same day, considering the fact that it is a matter exclusively triable by the Sessions Court. 3. Having regard to these facts, I feel that the petitioner herein may be permitted to surrender before the jurisdictional : apna a Re 2017/KER/227 Crl.M.C.20/17 2 magistrate within a period of 10 days from today and seek appropriate relief. In the event of his filing of an application, court below shall take up the application on the same day itself, having regard to the above facts. Crl.M.C. is disposed of as above.
