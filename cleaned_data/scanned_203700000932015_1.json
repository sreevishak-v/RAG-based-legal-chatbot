TO JUDGE SD 2015/KER/787 P. UBAID, J. Dated this the 8\" day of January, 2015 ORDER The petitioner herein is the original 5% accused in S.C.No0.281/2005 of the Court of Session, Thrissur. The offences involved in the case are under Sections 143, 147, 148 and 324 IPC read with Section 149 IPC. The original accused Nos 1 to 4 faced trial before the learned Additional Sessions Court (Adhoc)- II, Thrissur in S.C.No.281/2005, and obtained a judgment of acquittal on 05.09.2009 when none of the material witnesses examined by the prosecution including the first informant supported the prosecution. The case against the accused Nos 5 and 6 was split up and refiled when they remained consistently absent. Thereafter, the original 6\" accused faced trial in S.C.No. 1053/2009 before the same court, and he also obtained a judgment of acquittal on 04.05.2010, when all the material witnesses turned hostile. The case against the petitioner herein was again split up, and now it stands transferred to the register of long pending cases as L.P.No.64/2008. He now seeks orders Pee 2015/KER/787 CrlM.C.. No. 93/2015 2 quashing the prosecution on the ground that the substratum of the prosecution case stands lost, and continuance of the prosecution against him will not serve any purpose. Annexure-A2 and A3 judgments will show that the others obtained judgment of acquittal when nobody supported the prosecution. All the material witnesses including the injured first informant turned hostile during trial. The defacto complainant, Sabeesh, who sustained injuries in the incident is the 2\"? respondent herein, and the other person who sustained injuries is the 3% respondent. They have filed affidavit to the effect that they have settled the whole dispute with the accused including the petitioner herein, and that they have no grievance or complaint. In fact, on a perusal of the records, I find that there is absolutely nothing to attract Section 308 IPC in this case. It appears that the said section was incorporated by the police on the basis of a purely hypothetical statement. Any way, the whole dispute stands settled, and the parties have come to terms. It is definite that in such a_ situation, continuance of prosecution against the petitioner will not serve any purpose, other than wasting the Egan ate ap eas 2015/KER/787 CrlM.C.. No. 93/2015 3 precious time of the court, because nobody will support the prosecution, and the prosecution cannot, in any manner, improve the case, when the case against the petitioner goes to trial. In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed. The prosecution against the petitioner in S.C.No.281/2005, now pending before the Additional Sessions Court (Adhoc)-II, Thrissur as L.P.R.No.64/2008, will stand quashed under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
