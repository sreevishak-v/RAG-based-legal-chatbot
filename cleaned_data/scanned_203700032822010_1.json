Dated this the 23 day of January, 2014. ORDER Petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. Petitioner is the sole accused in a complaint case filed before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Attingal, numbered as C.C.No.1092 of 2008. The offence alleged against the petitioner herein is one punishable under Section 500 of the Indian Penal Code (in short, IPC). Annexure A is the complaint. 2. Allegation is that the Malayalam Daily by name Malayala Manorama' published a news item on 12.04.2006 with a caption ni1g]aog91@ asim mM wilew eadoMnfl23. Admittedly, the petitioner is the editor of the news paper. The complainant/1* respondent submitted that the statements in the news item are false and, per se, defamatory to him. Gist of the news item is that the complainants mother was locked up in a kennel and she was in an abandoned state. Local people intervened and rescued Pletal 2014/KER/55 Cr1.M.C.No.3282 of 2010 2 her. It is also mentioned in the news item that the complainants mother was labeled as an insane person and illegally confined in the kennel. Complainant would contend that all those allegations are false and amounted to defamatory statements. 3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, the learned counsel for the first respondent and the learned Public Prosecutor. 4. Learned counsel for the first respondent submitted that Annexure A complaint revealed an offence of defamation defined under Section 499 I.PC. It is also submitted by the learned counsel that the fact that his mother was locked up in a kennel itself is a disputed fact. It cannot be resolved in a proceeding under Section 482 Cr.P.C, he contended. 5. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the contents in the news item squarely fall within the first exception to Section 499 LP.C. Not only the petitioner's news paper, but also other leading news papers had published this news item. Pletal 2014/KER/55 Crl.M.C.No.3282 of 2010 3 Going by the first exception to Section 499 IPC, it is clear that if anything is imputed which is true concerning any person, if it be for the public good that the imputation should be made or published, then, it is not a defamation. Annexures C and D would show that other leading Malayalam dailies have also published the news. Further, in Annexure F reply notice send to Annexure E lawyer notice, it had been clearly stated that local television channels have telecasted the wrongful confinement of the complainants mother in a kennel. 6. It is also contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner has no role in choosing the local news item. He is the editor of the daily. Since the editor is not involved in selecting the news items, he cannot be prosecuted for an offence under Section 500 IPC. To buttress this contention, the decision in Mammen Mathew v. Radhakrishnan (2007 (4) KLT 833) is pressed into service. Considering the averments in the petition and on perusing the relevant legal provision, I am of the view Beat 2014/KER/55 Cr1.M.C.No.3282 of 2010 4 that the publication herein will squarely fall within the first exception to Section 499 I.P.C. Consequently, I find that there is no legal basis for prosecuting the petitioner for the alleged offence. The prosecution is nothing, but an abuse of the process of the court. In the result, the Crl.M.C is allowed. Annexure A complaint pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court I, Attingal is hereby quashed. All pending interlocutory applications will stand dismissed. Sd/- A.HARIPRASAD, JUDGE. //Trae Copy// P.Ato Judge amk"
