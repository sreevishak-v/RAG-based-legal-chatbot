The said case has arisen from Crime No.198 of 2003 of Vadakkekara Police Station registered inter alia for the offence punishable under sections 489(B), (C), 120(B) read with 34 of the IPC. 2.On his failure to appear before the learned Magistrate, non bailable warrant has been issued against him. The petitioner seeks for issuance of appropriate directions to the learned Magistrate to consider his application for recall of warrant and grant of bail on the date of surrender itself and to grant him bail. 3.It was owing to the contumacious conduct of the BRA Pink 2016/KER/33892 Crl.M.C.4906/2016 2 petitioner, that Non Bailable Warrant was issued against him to secure his presence before the court below. This court in exercise of powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure will not be justified in interfering with the discretion of the learned Magistrate in granting bail. 4.It is for the petitioner to approach the learned Magistrate and appraise the reasons for his absence and to seek for recalling the warrant and grant of bail. There is no reason for this Court to assume that the learned Magistrate will not exercise his discretion judicially and in accordance with law. 5.In the result, the petitioner is directed to surrender before the trial court within 2 weeks from the date of this order and prefer application for recall of warrant and also for grant of bail with advance notice to the BRA bee 2016/KER/33892 Crl.M.C.4906/2016 3 prosecutor concerned. In that event the learned Magistrate is directed to consider and dispose of the said application, uninfluenced by the pendency of the warrant, preferably on the same day itself, on its merits and in accordance with law. Petition is disposed off as above. Sd/- RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.YV. JUDGE vps"
