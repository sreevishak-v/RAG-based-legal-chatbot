This case is instituted upon the Final Report filed by the Sub Inspector of Police, Sreekaryam Police Station in Crime No. 1857/21 for the offences punishable under Sections 294(b), 323, 324, 427 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. 2. The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: The Informant is the uncle of the 1%t and 2 Accused. Due to the prior animosity towards the Informant, in furtherance of the common intention of the Accused persons to voluntarily cause hurt to the Informant, on 19.11.2021 at 8.00 pm at Pangappara at the road nearby S J Bhavan House; the 2? Accused showered obscene words on the Informant who attempted to resist the Accused persons form causing hurt to his nephew, and hit on his left wrist with a wooden log. The 1* Accused lifted up the sister of the Informant who had come there by getting hold of her nightie and dropped her down, resulting her dress to be torn. The ist and 2 Accused caught hold of her husband, pushed him down to the floor and kicked him. The gold chain of the 3 nephew of the Informant was lost in the scuffle. Thereby the Accused are alleged to have committed the above-mentioned offences. 3. The cognizance was taken on the basis of Final Report in respect of the offences under Sections 294(b), 323, 324, 427 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. On issuance of process, the Accused Persons entered appearance before this Court. They were enlarged on bail. They were represented by a Counsel of their own choice. Copies of all relevant Prosecution records were furnished to them. After hearing both parties and on perusing relevant records, charge was framed for the offences punishable under Sections 294(b), 323, 324, 427 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and the same was read over and explained to them, to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. 4. From the side of Prosecution CW1 alone was examined as PW1. The remaining witnesses were given up by the Learned APP as the material witness, the injured herself had turned hostile to the case of Prosecution. The other persons, the relatives of the injured though alleged to have been injured in the Final Report, none of them were arrayed as Charge Witnesses. Since no incriminating circumstances arose from the depositions of the witnesses, the examination of the Accused under Section 313(1)(b) of the CrPC was dispensed with. No Defence evidence was also adduced. 5. Heard both sides and perused the documents. The following points arise for consideration: (a) Have the Accused persons, in furtherance of their common intention, uttered obscene words to PW1 and thereby committed the offence punishable under section 294 (b)r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged (b) Have the Accused persons, in furtherance of their common intention, voluntarily caused hurt to PW1 and thereby committed offence punishable under Section 323 of the IPC as alleged? 4 (c) Have the Accused persons, in furtherance of their common intention, voluntarily caused hurt to PW1 with wooden log and thereby committed offence punishable under Section 324 of the IPC as alleged? (d) Have the Accused Persons in furtherance of their common intention on the same caused mischief and thereby committed the offence punishable under section 427 r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged? (d) If so, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded? 6. Points (a) to (c): These points are considered together for the sake of brevity and for avoiding repetition. PW1 deposed that he resides in Manvila. He deposed that he had not sustained any injury in this incident. He does not remember the exact date of the incident as two years have already lapsed. It was around late evening, there was an argument at his house by some people and the police had come. He had given Exhibit P1 statement to the police regarding the incident. He deposed that at the time of the incident, his wife and sister were present there. Neither any damage, nor any mischief was caused in the incident. There was contusion on his hand on account of his hand having been held by them. He deposed that he can very well identify the persons who had so assaulted him. But, the Accused persons were not involved in that incident. he is unable to identify the assailants who assaulted him. To the leading question put forth by the Learned APP as to whether he had settled the matter between the parties, he categorically deposed that there is one more case pending before this Court between same parties, in which he is one of the Accused; and that both the cases have been settled by them, and he has already filed a Compromise Petition to that effect. On perusal of the evidence led by the Prosecution and the materials on record, it is clear from the testimony of PW1 that there is no evidence to support the Prosecution case. It is pertinent to note that the parties are relatives and the 5 other persons alleged to have been injured in the Final Report is not even arrayed as Charge Witnesses. Furthermore, the fact that PW1 was injured is brought from his evidence. But there is no whisper that that it was the Accused persons who had allegedly assaulted him. Thus, there is nothing material on record to prove the Prosecution case. Also, Compromise Petition was filed as CMP 3650/2024. The same was rejected and disallowed for the reason that offences involved non- compoundable Offences well. Further, PW1 admitted the said factum of composition and settlement between parties when he mounted the box. In the aforesaid circumstances, the remaining witness was given up by the Prosecution as no purpose would be served in examining him in the above circumstances. Neither the ingredients of the alleged offences, nor the involvement of the Accused persons brought out in the evidence adduced by the Prosecution. Thus, this Court is of the view that the Prosecution has miserably failed to prove the involvement of this Accused persons in the above Crime beyond reasonable doubt. Hence, this Court finds that the Prosecution has failed to prove the case against the Accused and therefore, Points (a) to (c) are found in favour of the Accused. 7. Point (d): In light of finding in the foregoing points, this point does not arise for consideration. In the result, the Accused persons are found not guilty of having committed the offences punishable under Sections 294(b), 323, 324, 427 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. He is acquitted of the aforesaid offences under Section 248(1) of the CrPC. His bail bond stands cancelled and he is set at liberty.
