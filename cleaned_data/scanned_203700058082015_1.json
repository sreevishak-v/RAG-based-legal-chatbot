The main complaint of the petitioner is that the court below has taken cognizance of the offences even when the final report was hopelessly barred by limitation. 3. It seems that no opportunity was granted to the petitioner to challenge the said fact. In order to condone the inordinate delay, an opportunity ought to have been granted to the petitioner by the court below. Matters being so, the taking of cognizance of Annexure-lll final report is liable to be quashed. 2018/KER/491 Crl.M.C.5808/2015 5. In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and all further proceedings against the petitioner in CC No.942/2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Kattappana, based on Annexure-lll final report in Crime No.2065/2012 of Kattappana Police Station, are quashed. An opportunity shall be given to the petitioner to challenge the proceedings. The petitioner shall appear before the court below on the next posting date.
