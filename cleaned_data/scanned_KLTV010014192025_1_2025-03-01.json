    "full_text": "IN THE COURT OF THE SESSIONS JUDGE, THIRUVANANTHAPURAM PRESENT : SMT. NAZEERA.S, SESSIONS JUDGE On Saturday, 1* day of March, 2025/ 10\" Phalguna, 1946 CRIMINAL M..C. No.590/2025 (Crime No. 1649/2024 of Peroorkada Police Station ) Petitioner/Accused No.1:- John Prince Idicula, aged 38 years, S/o P Y Idicula, residing at Puthenvila Parambil, Pidavoor PO, Pidavoor Village, Pathanapuram, Kollam By Advocate. M Sajukhan RESPONDENTS:- 1. State of Kerala. 2. Station House Officer, Peroorkada Police Station, Thiravananthapuram. By Public Prosecutor Dr T Geena Kumary This Crl.M.C. came up for hearing on 28/02/2025 and the court on 01-03-2025 passed the following : ORDER This is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail. 2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable under Sections 354A(1)(i), 354A(1)(ii), 354A(1)(iv), 406 and 420, r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, and Crime No. 1649/2024 of Peroorkada Police Station is registered against the petitioner/ 1* accused. Criminal M.C.No.590/2025 1/5 3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- The accused Nos. 1 and 2, in furtherance of their common intention to obtain wrongful gain and to cause wrongful loss to the defacto complainant, made her believe that they will arrange her a job through JOJO Associates, as Support Care Taker in the United Kingdom, and obtained a total sum of Rs.14.5 lakhs from the defacto complainant through the Bank account of JOJO Associates maintained in South Indian Bank, Pathanapurem Branch. Thereafter, the 2\"? accused, made phone calls to the defacto complainant repeatedly, despite a clear indication of disinterest by her, and showed his nudity through Whatsapp video, causing mental agony to her. The accused did not arrange the job as promised to the defacto complainant and hence she was compelled to stay in the U.K., and also did not return the money to her, thereby cheated her. 4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The Investigating Officer filed report opposing the anticipatory bail application. 5. Heard. Perused the records. 6. The only point to be considered is, whether an order of anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioner/ 1* accused. 7. The Point:- The petitioner/ 1* accused along with the 2\" accused is alleged to have offered job to the defacto complainant in U.K. and obtained money from her, and thereafter, neither provided the offered job nor returned the money to her. Criminal M.C.No.590/2025 2/5 8. The petitioner submits that, he is the owner and proprietor of JOJO Associates, situated at Pathanapuram, a Company, which deal with migration and job visa processing, and during the year 2023, the defacto complainant approached his Company and submitted an application for getting a Carrier visa to United Kingdom, and on depositing the requisite fees and other processing charges, she secured a visa to U.K. under the sponsorship of a company, and accordingly, she left for United Kingdom and was employed therein. It is submitted that, once the defacto complainant received the visa and left for U.K., the Companys obligation towards her has been discharged, but, after working in U.K. for more than one and half year, now she had filed this false complaint alleging utter falsehood. It is also submitted that, anything happened in United Kingdom in connection with her employer or the company in which she was employed is not at all connected with the petitioner or his company, and in fact, the reason why she left U.K. is not known to the petitioner. The petitioner submits that, there is nothing in her statement which attract Sections 354A(1)(ii), 354A(1)(iii) and 354A(1)(iv) of the Indian Penal Code towards the petitioner. 9. There is serious allegations as against the petitioner. It is seen from the report that he had collected the amount from the defacto complainant. However, admittedly, he had arranged a visa and had provided a certificate of sponsorship and she had left for U.K. It is seen from the report that, there is no Criminal M.C.No.590/2025 3/5 allegation against the petitioner pertaining to sexual harassment, and no complaint was registered by her at the time of the alleged commission of offence. In fact, the main allegation against the petitioner is with regard to the financial transaction and the failure of the accused persons in providing job as offered. Whether there is any dishonest intention on the part of the accused persons and whether the offered job is provided is a matter of evidence. There is no prima facie case as against the petitioner / 1* accused. It would be a travesty of justice, if the petitioner is put behind the bars, if actually he has not committed the offence. No criminal antecedents of the petitioner is brought to the notice of this court. 10. In view of my discussion above, it appears that there is no impediment in granting a pre-arrest bail to the petitioner. Considering all these aspects, it is found that this is a fit case where a pre-arrest bail can be granted to the petitioner. In the result, the petition is allowed on the following conditions:- (1) In the event of arrest, the petitioner/ 1* accused shall be released on bail on his executing bond for Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) with two solvent sureties for the like sum each to the satisfaction of the arresting officer/Investigating Officer, as the case may be. (2) Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. on every Thursday for a Criminal M.C.No.590/2025 45 period of 3 (three) months or till the filing of the final report, whichever is earlier. (3) Petitioner shall also appear before the Investigating Officer as and when required. (4) Petitioner shall not commit any offence while on bail. (5) Petitioner shall not attempt to contact the defacto complainant or any of the prosecution witnesses, directly or through any other person, or in any other way try to tamper with the evidence or influence any witnesses or other persons related to the investigation. In case of any violation of the above conditions or misuse of liberty, the prosecution or the defacto complainant is at liberty to approach jurisdictional court for cancellation of bail.
