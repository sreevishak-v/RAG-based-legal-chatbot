R1-R2 BY SRI.E.C.BINESH, PP R3 BY ADV. KAMALESWARAM S. MANIKANTAN NAIR OTHER PRESENT: THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 07.01.2020, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: _ Be Crl1.M.C.No.5721 of 2013 > 2020/KER/360 ORDER Dated this the 7th day of January 2020 The petitioner is arraigned as the 374 accused in C.C.No.99/2012 on the file of the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Thiruvananthapuram, for having allegedly committed the offences punishable under Sections 420, 464, 468, 470, 471 read with Section 34 of I.P.C. along with two other accused. The specific allegation is that the accused persons had induced the defacto complainant to purchase a Hyundai Accent Car bearing Reg.No.KL-01-AB-914, registered in the name of the 3%? accused, making him believe that the vehicle has run only 71,000 kms. and thereby inducing him to deliver a sum of Rs.2,10,000/- as consideration. It is understood that the odometer of the vehicle was tampered with and that the defacto complainant was cheated and he filed a complaint. The specific allegation in the final report itself is that the accused 1 and 2 had introduced somebody as the 379 accused-Vijayan Menon. The specific case of the petitioner is that he was abroad at that time and Enron. Be Crl1.M.C.No.5721 of 2013 3 2020/KER/360 therefore could not have participated in the alleged sale of the vehicle to the complainant resulting in the alleged cheating. 2. A report was called for from the investigating officer and in the first report it is very specifically stated by the Sub Inspector that the other accused had introduced somebody as the 3*4 accused by his name, but he has no specific case that the 3** accused was present in person for the alleged transaction. Copy of the document has also been produced by the 3*7* accused to indicate that he had arrived in India only after the alleged transaction and therefore he could not have been present for the alleged transaction. A further report was called for regarding the presence of the petitioner/accused on the date of occurrence and further time was sought by the investigating authority to verify the matter with the FRRO Thiruvananthapuram regarding the arrival of the petitioner. But no report has been filed so far. 3. Final report has been filed and the matter is pending before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Enron. Be Crl1.M.C.No.5721 of 2013 4 2020/KER/360 Thiruvananthapuram. In view of the stay against the 37? accused, the trial has not yet been proceeded. Considering the entire available materials on record, there is every possibility that the petitioner was not present on the alleged date of occurrence and therefore the very substance of the case of the prosecution as against the 3%? accused does not have legs to stand on. I am convinced about the non-maintainability of the case against the petitioner and therefore the Crl1.M.C. is allowed and the entire proceedings against the petitioner in C.C.No.99/2012 on the file of the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Thiruvananthapuram, stands quashed under Section 482, Cr.P.C. and the petitioner is discharged.
