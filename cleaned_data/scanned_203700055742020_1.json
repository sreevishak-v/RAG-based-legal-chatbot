VIPIN T JOSE OTHER PRESENT: PP T.R.RENJITH THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 08.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: eel Bie CRL.M.C.NO.5574 OF 2020 3 202 U/KER/1355 ORDER Dated this the 8th day of January 2021 Petitioners are accused Nos.1 to 6 in Crime No.135/2017 registered at the Hosdurg Police Station, Kasargode for offences punishable under Sections 341, 323, 109, 120B read with Section 34 of IPC, now pending as C.C.No.159/2018 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate-I, Hosdurg. The de facto complainant, at whose instance the crime was registered, is arrayed as the 2 respondent. Annexure-AIIT affidavit has been filed by 2 respondent stating that the dispute, which was the reason for the incident and registration of the crime, has been resolved amicably and he has no subsisting grievance against the petitioners. eel Bae CRL.M.C.NO.5574 OF 2020 4 202 U/KER/1355 2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also, who, on instructions, submits that the petitioners have no criminal antecedents. 3. Having considered the gravity of the offences alleged, nature of the injury caused and having perused the affidavit filed by the 2 respondent, the contents of which are submitted to be true and voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled and no public interest is involved in this matter. Moreover, in view of the settlement, possibility of the criminal proceedings ending in conviction is remote. As such, continuance of the proceedings will amount to an abuse of process of court and hence, in view of the legal position set out by the Honourable Supreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another [(2012) 10 BIE ee aoe Bias CRL.M.C.NO.5574 OF 2020 202 U/KER/1355 5 SCC 303], there is no impediment in granting the relief sought. In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. The proceedings in C.C.No.159/2018 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate- I, Hosdurg is quashed.
