CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 11.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: BRS Bienen 2021/KER/1524 Crl.M.C. No.2146 of 2020 -3- ORDER Dated this the 11% day of January, 2021 Petitioners are the accused in Crime No. 213 of 2020 registered at the Punaloor Police Station for offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 294 (b), 341, 323 and 149 of IPC. The de facto complainant, at whose instance the crime was registered, is arrayed as the third respondent. Annexure A2 affidavit has been filed by the third respondent stating that the dispute which led to registration of the crime, has been settled amicably and he has _ no_- subsisting grievance in the matter. 2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also, who, on instructions, submits that the petitioners have no criminal antecedents. 3. Having considered the gravity of the BRS Bienen 2021/KER/1524 Crl.M.C. No.2146 of 2020 -4- offences alleged, nature of the injury caused and having perused the affidavit filed by the third respondent, the contents of which are submitted to be true and voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled and that no public interest is involved in this matter. Moreover, in view of the settlement, possibility of the criminal proceedings ending in conviction is remote. As such, continuance of the proceedings will amount to an abuse of process of court and hence, in view of the legal position set out by the Honourable Supreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is no impediment in granting the relief sought. In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. Annexure AI FIR and all proceedings in Crime BRS Bienen 2021/KER/1524 Crl.M.C. No.2146 of 2020 -5- No.213 of 2020 registered at the Punaloor Police Station is quashed.
