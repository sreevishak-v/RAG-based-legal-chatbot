Crl.M.C.No. 7864 of 2017 Dated this the 8 day of December, 2017 ORDER The petitioner herein stands arrayed as accused in CC No.762/2017 of JFCM , Kunnamangalam Police station for offences punishable under section 380 IPC. 2. The allegation of the prosecution was that, 7/9/2017, while the second respondent, who is the defacto complainant, was in the hospital, the petitioner herein removed the bracelet of the child of the defacto complainant. Alleging the commission of crime, the complaint was laid and the petitioner was arrested. She is in custody since then. The petitioner has approached this Court on a premise that, the dispute with the second respondent has been amicably settled. To substantiate it, the petitioner relied on Annexure 2 affidavit affirmed by the defacto complainant. 3. The learned counsel for the second respondent affirmed the execution of the above affidavit and stated that the second respondent was duly compensated by the petitioner and she has no objection in quashing the proceedings. mall 2017/KER/49774 Crl.M.C.No.7864/2017 2 4. Learned Public Prosecutor submitted that, oral instructions have been received from the defacto complainant to the effect that she has no grievance against the petitioner herein and that the matter has been settled. 5. It was submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that, after the alleged incident, the petitioner herein was taken to the police station and two crimes were simultaneously registered against her. Regarding the second crime, Crl.M.C.No.7760/2017 was filed which was allowed by this Court. There is nothing on record to show that the petitioner herein has got any other criminal antecedents. 6. Having considered the above, I am inclined to quash the criminal proceedings against the petitioner herein to meet the ends of justice. Accordingly, Crl.M.C.is allowed. All further proceedings pursuant to Annexure-Al1(CCNo.762/2017 of JFCM, Kunnamangalam) stands quashed. The petitioner shall be released from jail if her presence is not required in connection with any other crime. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS Judge dpk /true copy/ PS to Judge.
