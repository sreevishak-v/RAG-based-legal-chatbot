Crl.M.C.No.261 of 2024 Dated this the 19\" day of January 2024 ORDER Petitioner is an accused in C.P.No.7/2024 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-ll, Kollam arising out of Crime No.197/2021 of Sakthikulangara Police Station, alleging offences punishable under Section 452, 324, 326, 307 r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. 2. Smt.Anjana Kannath, learned Counsel for the petitioner contended that due to the failure of the petitioner to appear before the learned Magistrate, a non-bailable warrant has been issued apart from a lookout circular. It is further submitted that, without even serving summons on the petitioner, a non bailable warrant could not have been issued. It was contended that, initially petitioners was not known to have been arrayed as an accused. Thereafter the investigation was transferred to the Crime Branch and it was only then that petitioner was included in the list of accused, by which time, petitioner had gone abroad. It was contended by the learned Counsel that the entire procedure of treating the petitioner as absconding and issuing a non- bailable warrant are all procedurally flawed and contrary to law. It was however submitted that petitioner is willing to appear before the Court Bes ial 2024/KER/4531 CRL.MC NO. 261 OF 2024 3 and seek recall of warrant and apply for bail, but since he apprehends remand by the learned Magistrate, petitioner seeks for a direction to to have his application considered on the same date itself. 3. The learned Public Prosecutor submitted that petitioner has been absconding for a long time and it was only after a look out circular was issued that he has finally to come down and seek bail. 4. Taking note of the submissions made by the learned Counsel for the petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor, | am of the view that since the petitioner has expressed his willingness to come down and appear before the Court, it is only appropriate that the Crl.M.C.is disposed of with a direction. 5. Accordingly, if petitioner appears before the learned Magistrate on or before 31.01.2024, and apply for recall of warrant and for bail, the learned Magistrate shall consider and pass appropriate orders on the same day itself. Since the petitioner has expressed his willingness to come down and appear before the Court, the lookout circular issued against him shall be kept in abeyance till 31.01.204 to enable him to appear before the Court. The Cri.M.C. is disposed of as above.
