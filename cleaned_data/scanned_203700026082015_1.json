Hence, he has filed this Crl.M.C. seeking an order directing the Magistrate Court to consider and pass appropriate orders on his bail application on the day of surrender itself. 2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor for respondent. 3. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, this Crl.M.C. is disposed of directing the petitioner to surrender before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Ettumanoor BEST a eae 2015/KER/17456 Crl.M.C. No.2608 of 2015 -20- within two weeks from today and the Magistrate Court is further directed to consider and pass appropriate orders on the bail application filed by the petitioner on the same day itself, in accordance with law. The non-bailable warrant issued against the petitioner shall be kept in abeyance for a period of two weeks from today. This Crl.M.C. is disposed of. Sd/- ANIL K. NARENDRAN JUDGE /[TRUE COPY// P.A.
