SRI.SUNU P.JOHN R1 BY SRI.SANTOSH PETER, SR.PP THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 08.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: OPE Crl.MC.No.3615 OF 2013 2 2021/KER/1229 ORDER Dated this the 8th day of January 2021 The petitioner is the accused in C.P No.23/2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kolencherry. The above case is chargesheeted against the petitioner alleging offences punishable under Sections 23 and 26 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 (for short 'the JJ Act). 2. The prosecution case is that on 17.10.2011 at about 5.40 pm, charge witness No.1, the Sub Inspector of Police, Ambalamedu Police Station while on patrolling duty found charge witness No.2 Saravanan, aged 16 years near Eathikkara, Kappela. When the child was questioned, he deposed that from June onwards, the petitioner kept minor Saravanan for the purpose of hazardous employment at his shop No.II/235 of Thiruvaniyoor Grama Panchayath and assaulted him. So the accused is alleged to have committed offences punishable under Sections 23 and 26 of the JJ Act. 3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor. ope Cri.MC.No.3615 OF 2013 3 2021/KER/1229 4. The counsel for the petitioner submitted that even if the entire allegations are accepted, the offence under Sections 23 and 26 of the JJ Act is not attracted in the facts and circumstances of the case. The counsel submitted that Annexure 3 is the transfer certificate of the child issued by the Head Master, U.M UP School, Meenakshi Nagar, Madurai East, Madurai in which the date of birth of the petitioner is mentioned as 26.5.1993. The counsel submitted that the alleged incident in this case is happened on 17.10.2011. According to the counsel, as on that date the 2\"* respondent is aged more than 18 years and therefore the offence is not prima facie made out. The counsel also submitted that even if the averments in the final report is accepted, the offences under Sections 23 and 26 of the JJ Act is not attracted in the facts and circumstances of the case. According to the counsel, even the job allegedly given to the child is not hazardous in nature. 5. The Public Prosecutor submitted that the offence under Sections 23 and 26 of the JJ Act is attracted in this case and it is a matter of evidence and this Court may not interfere with the final report under Section 482 CrPC 6. When this Crl.M.C came up for consideration, this Court admitted the case and a stay order was also passed. This ope 10] - EEE a Crl.MC.No.3615 OF 2013 4 202UKER/1229 Criminal Miscellaneous Case is pending before this Court from 2013 onwards. 7. The main allegation in Annexure 2 final report is extracted hereunder: \"EPOaJOODlOIAIOO AGlaoas aan esdeil o.rigilenrd aDSle] aMMss Moac Mlainileldlaca EQao@dladacmM EG COANCWHRHOAIOS CIOS OCT Helle?

Sections 23 and 26 of the JJ Act is extracted hereunder: 23. Punishment for cruelty to juvenile or child. Whoever, having the actual charge of, or control over, a juvenile or the child, assaults, abandons, exposes or wilfully neglects the juvenile or causes or procures him to be assaulted, abandoned, exposed or neglected in a manner likely to cause such juvenile or the child unnecessary mental or physical suffering shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months, or fine, or with both. 26. Exploitation of juvenile or child employee.Whoever ostensibly procures a juvenile or the child for the purpose of any hazardous employment keeps him in bondage and withholds his earnings or uses such earning for his own purposes shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to OPE Cri.MC.No.3615 OF 2013 5 2021/KER/1229 three years and shall also be liable to fine. 9. After going through the averments in the final report, according to me, it is very difficult to accept the prosecution case that the petitioner committed the offences under Sections 23 and 26 of the JJ Act. The petitioner has got a case based on Anneuxre 3 transfer certificate that as on the date of the alleged incident, the 2\"! respondent is aged more than 18 years. Moreover, to attract the offence under Section 23 of the JJ Act, the prosecution has to establish that the accused is having the actual charge of, or control over, a juvenile or the child and he assaults, abandons, exposes or wilfully neglects the juvenile or causes or procures him to be assaulted, abandoned, exposed or neglected in a manner likely to cause such juvenile or the child unnecessary mental or physical suffering. There is no evidence to prima facie show that the petitioner assaults, abandons, exposes or wilfully neglects the juvenile. Similarly to attract Section 26 of the Act the accused should ostensibly procures a juvenile or the child for the purpose of any hazardous employment keeps him in bondage and withholds his earnings or uses such earning for his own purposes. There is no evidence even to show that the employment was hazardous in nature. Therefore, even if the entire allegations in the final ope Cri.MC.No.3615 OF 2013 6 2021/KER/1229 report are accepted, according to me, the offences under Sections 23 and 26 of the JJ Act is not attracted. 10. Moreover, as per Annexure 3 transfer certificate, the age of the 2\" respondent will be more than 18 years as on the date of the alleged incident. Considering the entire facts and circumstances of the case, according to me, the continuation of the proceedings against the petitoiner is an abuse of process of law. Therefore, this Crl.M.C is allowed. All further proceedings in C.P No.23/2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kolencherry are quashed.
