SESSIONS JUDGE, KOLLAM IN CRL.M.P.NO.1949/2017 IN SC NO.139/2012. RESPONDENTS' EXHIBITS : NIL /TRUE COPY/ P. A. TO JUDGE Pn De 2018/KER/513 SUNIL THOMAS, J. Dated this the 5\" day of January, 2018 ORDER The petitioner stands arrayed as an accused in Crime No.989/2011 of Chathannoor Police Station now pending as S.C. No.139/2012 of IV Additional Sessions Court, Kollam for offences punishable under Sections 376, 450, 506(ii) and 341 of IPC. The crux of the allegation was that, on 06.07.2011 at 12.00 noon, the petitioner trespassed into the house of the de facto complainant and committed rape on her. Witnesses were examined to support the prosecution case. In the course of investigation, the petitioner was subjected to a potency test. Annexure 7 is the Certificate of Potency dated 09.07.2011 issued by an Assistant Surgeon of the District Hospital, Kollam, by which the final opinion was reserved pending the report of urological examination. | It seems that the petitioner was not subjected to a urological examination in the course of investigation. After the examination of CW 22, who was examined as PW 15 and after marking of Exhibits P1 to P20, it seems that the prosecution noticed the above and filed an application for subjecting the petitioner to a urological examination. The court below by the impugned order repeat 2018/KER/513 Cri. M. C. No. 8796 of 2017 2 in Cr.M.P. No.1949/2017 allowed the application directing the petitioner to appear before the Urologist, District Hospital, Kollam on 18.12.2017 at 9.00 a.m. for examination by the Urologist. This order is challenged in this proceedings. Having regard to the nature of the relief sought, | am not inclined to issue notice to the 3 respondent, since the matter itself can be disposed of without her presence. 2. The specific contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that in the nature of allegation raised against him, the potency and the capability of the petitioner herein to enter into physical relationship is crucial. It is contended that the potency certificate issued by the Doctor in the above circumstance without a urological examination at that point of time, is a very valuable defence which has accrued to him, due to the lapse of time and the laches on the part of the prosecution and the consequent lacuna cannot be filled up at this length of time by directing the petitioner to undergo a_ urological examination. It was further contended that the petitioner had certain physiological defects affecting his potency at the time of investigation and that he was taking medicines for that. Further 2018/KER/513 Cri. M. C. No. 8796 of 2017 3 contention advanced at the time of hearing is that, even if he has gained physical ability now, that cannot relate back to the date of original examination of him on 09.07.2011. 3. Definitely, this is a valuable defence available to the petitioner. However, having regard to the fact that even if the petitioner undergoes urological examination, the court below will have to appreciate the validity of that document specifically having regard to the delay that has occurred in undergoing the urological test and also the question whether the report given at a subsequent stage can relate back to the actual physical capacity as on the date of incident, are matters to be specifically considered by the court below, while appreciating evidence. Reserving this right, | am inclined to dispose of the Crl.M.C. with a direction that the petitioner shall appear before the court below on the next posting date, on which day, the court shall fix a date for appearance of the petitioner for urological examination. Thereafter, the court may proceed in accordance with law and while appreciating the evidence, the court shall take note of the observations made above. 4. The warrant issued by the court below in the above Ral Bane 2018/KER/513 Cri. M. C. No. 8796 of 2017 4 circumstance, will be kept in abeyance till the date of his appearance before the court below on the next posting date, on which day, the court below shall consider his application for withdrawal of the warrant, considering the fact that he had approached this Court challenging the impugned order. Crl.M.C. is disposed of as above. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE. Pn"
