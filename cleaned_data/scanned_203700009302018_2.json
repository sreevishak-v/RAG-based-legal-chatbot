The aforesaid case was registered against the petitioner on the basis of the first information statement given to the police by the second respondent (hereinafter referred to as the complainant). 3. The material averments in the ffirst information statement given to the police by the complainant are as follows: The complainant had purchased a villa constructed by the accused in the year 2010 as per an agreement. The accused has not provided recreation space in the compound of the villa as per Rule 31(iii) of the Kerala Panchayat Building Rules, 2011. Inspite Peet (Blea 2020/KER/687 Cr1.M.C.No.930/2018 ; of repeated demands made by the complainant and the other persons who owned villas in the residential complex, no such facility has been provided by the accused. The accused has cheated the complainant and the other persons who reside in the villas. 4. This petition is filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C for quashing Annexure-A6 first information report (FIR) registered against the petitioner on the basis of the first information statement given to the police by the complainant. 5. Notice was served on the second respondent but he has not chosen to appear and contest the case. Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor. 6. Learned counsel for the petitioner has contended that the complainant had entered into an agreement with the petitioner in the year 2010, entrusting the construction of the villa to him. The Kerala Panchayat Building Rules, 2011 (hereinafter referred to as the Rules') was not in force at that time. Therefore, the allegation that the petitioner has not complied with the requirements under Rule 31(iii) of the Rules, Peet (Blea 2020/KER/687 Cr1.M.C.No.930/2018 ; has no legs to stand on. Learned counsel for the petitioner also contended that, even if it is accepted that there was any agreement between the petitioner and the complainant with regard to providing of recreational space, non-compliance with such a stipulation in the agreement, amounts to only a breach of contract and the offence punishable under Section 420 I.P.C will not be attracted. Learned counsel for the petitioner further contended that the averments in the first information statement given to the police by the complainant do not attract the ingredients of the offence of cheating as defined under Section 415 I.P.C. 7. Learned Public Prosecutor has not pointed out, how the Rules which came into force only in the year 2011, would be applicable to the construction of the villa which was made as per an agreement executed in the year 2010. 8. The Rules came into force only on 14.02.2011. Rule 31(iii) of the Rules reads as follows: All new developments including land subdivisions, plot developments and pooling of land | ood BSS 2020/KER/687 Cr1.M.C.No.930/2018 bs) owned by different owners shall be subject to the following, namely, (iii) When the area of the land under development work, layout or subdivision (exceeding ten plots) is 50 ares or more, 10% of the total area shall be provided for recreational open spaces and shall be suitably located to be accessible to the residents of the locality: The open space shall be provided exclusive of streets, culde-sacs, water body or swimming pools: 9. It is evident that Rule 31 applies only to new development of lands and plots and it does not apply to any development of land which had already commenced before it came into force. 10. Before the Rules came into force, the Kerala Municipality Building Rules, 1999 were applicable to Panchayats. In the instant case, the villa purchased by the complainant is situated in a Panchayat. Rule 50(1) of the Kerala Municipality Building Rules, 1999 provides that any residential apartment having more than 12 dwelling units in a single plot or single building shall be provided with a recreational space of suitable Peet (Blea 2020/KER/687 Cr1.M.C.No.930/2018 ; size. Rule 50(2) of the aforesaid Rules provides that the recreational space as per sub-rule (1) shall have not less than 6% of the total floor area of the units taken together and a minimum 35% of such recreational space shall be provided outside the building on the ground itself. However, Rule 50(1) and Rule 50(2) of the Kerala Municipality Building Rules, 1999 are applicable only to an apartment as defined under Rule 2(g) of the aforesaid Rules and the aforesaid provisions are not applicable to any villa which is an independent building. Rule 2(g) of the Kerala Municipality Building Rules states that the word apartment is synonymous with residential flat. 11. Even if it is accepted that the petitioner had agreed to provide recreational space or other facilities in the compound of the villa of the complainant, non-compliance with such stipulation in the agreement, if any executed between the petitioner and the complainant, will amount to only a breach of contract unless it is shown that even at the time of entering into the agreement, the petitioner had dishonest intention of not providing such facilities. Mere breach of a stipulation in the agreement will not amount to Peet (Blea 2020/KER/687 Cr1.M.C.No.930/2018 , an offence of cheating which is defined under Section 415 I.P.C and the offence punishable under Section 420 I.P.C. 12. There is distinction between mere breach of contract and the offence of cheating. Mere breach of contract cannot give rise to criminal prosecution for cheating unless fraudulent or dishonest intention is shown right at the beginning of the transaction. To hold a person guilty of cheating it is necessary to show that he had fraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of making the promise. From his mere failure to keep up the promise subsequently such a culpable intention right at the beginning, that is, when he made the promise, cannot be presumed. 13. In the instant case, there is no allegation in the first information statement given to the police by the complainant that the petitioner had dishonest intention of not providing recreational space when he entered into the agreement for construction of the villa with the complainant. 14. Section 405 I.P.C shows that the ingredients of the offence of criminal breach of trust are the following: i) a person Peet (Blea 2020/KER/687 Cr1.M.C.No.930/2018 ; should have been entrusted with property, or entrusted with dominion over property; ii) that person should dishonestly misappropriate or convert to his own use that property, or dishonestly use or dispose of that property or wilfully suffer any other person to do so; and iii) that such misappropriation, conversion, use or disposal should be in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal contract which the person has made, touching the discharge of such trust. 15. In the instant case, the complainant has no grievance that the money, if any, entrusted by him with the petitioner was used by the petitioner in any manner in violation of the stipulations contained in the agreement executed between him and the petitioner. Therefore, the offence punishable under Section 406 I.P.C is also not attracted. 16. In the aforesaid circumstances, continuation of the criminal proceedings against the petitioner would be an abuse of process of law. The proceedings initiated against him pursuant to Annexure-A6 FIR are liable to be quashed. a (Blea 2020/KER/687 Cr1.M.C.No.930/2018 9 17. Consequently, the petition is allowed. The entire proceedings against the petitioner based on Annexure-A6 FIR in Crime No.1000/2016 of Chottanikkara police station, are hereby quashed.
