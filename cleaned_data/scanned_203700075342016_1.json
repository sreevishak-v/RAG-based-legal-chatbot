RESPONDENT (S)' EXHIBITS ----------------------- NIL /TRUE COPY/ PS TO JUDGE. 2017/KER/S58 SUNIL THOMAS, J. Crl.M.C.No. 7534. of 2016 Dated this the 3 day of January, 2017 ORDER The petitioner is the accused in C.C No.430/2010 of JFCM Court, Ponnani. The crime was registered for offences punishable under Sections 323 and 324 read with Section 34 IPC. 2. On the basis of a complaint that accused on 11/2/2007 attacked the defacto complainant and her family members crime was registered on 12/2/2007. Annexure Al final report was submitted only on 8/6/2010. Contending that the final report was submitted clearly beyond the period of limitation prescribed under Section 468 of Cr.P.C. and is liable to be quashed, the petitioners have approached this Court for quashing Annexure Al final report. An application was filed before the court below raising the above contentions which was rejected by the court below by Ext.P1 order. 3. Perusal of the available records, indicate that though FIR was registered on 12/2/2007, after investigation the final report was laid only on 8/6/2010. The learned counsel contended that this was beyond the limitation period as prescribed under Section 468 Cr.P.C. Learned counsel relied on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Udai Shankar Awasthi v. State of U.P.& 2017/KER/58 Cr.MC No.7534/2016 2 Another {2013 KHC 4025) wherein it was held that law of limitation prescribed under the Cr.P.C. must be observed. But, in certain exceptional circumstances, taking into consideration the gravity of the charge, the Court may condone delay, recording reasons for the same, in the event that it is found necessary to condone such delay in the interest of justice. 4. The question of limitation was considered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Darsan Singh Saini v. Soham Singh ((2016) 2 SCC ( Cri.) 418) wherein it was held that limitation under Section 468 Cr.P.C.has to be reckoned with reference to the date of incident and date of complaint. The Hon'ble Supreme Court relied on the authoritative pronouncement of the Constitution Bench in Sarah Mathew v. Institute of Cardio Vascular Diseases ( 2014 ) 2 SCC 62 wherein the Supreme Court held that for the purpose of computing limitation under section 468 Cr.P.C., the relevant date is the date of filing the complaint or the date of presentation and not the date on which Magistrate took cognizance. Hence, the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner in this case is not legally sustainable. 5. In the light of the above , I find no illegality, infirmity in the findings of the court below in Ext.P1. Hence, it is liable to be confirmed. I also find no reason to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.to quash the proceedings before the court below. Ba ala ieee raphe ee 2017/KER/58 Cr.MC No.7534/2016 3 In the result, Cr.M.C.is dismissed. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS Judge dpk /true copy/ PS to Judge."
