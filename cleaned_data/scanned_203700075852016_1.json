Crl.M.C.No.7585 of 2016 Dated this the 9\" day of January, 2017 ORDER Petitioners herein are the accused in Crime No.467 of 2012 of Majeshwar Police Station for offences punishable under sections 143, 147, 341, 323 and 506(i) r/w 149 of Indian Penal Code. 2. Prosecution alleged that on 23.08.2012 at 7.30p.m., accused formed into an unlawful assembly and wrongfully restrained the de facto complainant and assaulted him. Complaint was laid by the de facto complainant and after investigation, final report was laid. Matter is now pending as C.C.No.213 of 2013 of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kasaragod. 3. Petitioners approached this Court contending that the disputes between the parties have been voluntarily settled. An affidavit has been filed by the de facto complainant as Annexure-A2 touching upon the settlement arrived at. It is asserted in the affidavit that the de facto complainant does not propose to pursue the matter in the light of the settlement arrived at between the parties. Learned Public Prosecutor on instructions submitted that Bl Be 2017/KER/957 Cri.M.C.7585/16 2 the parties are not involved in any other crime and that, they have voluntarily settled the dispute. In the light of above, I am inclined to allow the parties to give a quietus to the entire dispute. In the result, Crl.M.C is allowed. All further proceedings arising from Crime No.467 of 2012 of Majeshwar Police Station stand quashed. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS Judge Sbna/9/1/17 True Copy / PA to Judge"
