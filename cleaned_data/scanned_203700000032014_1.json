Bitar) 2014/KER/44 HARUN-UL-RASHID, J. Cri.M.C No.3 Of 2014 Dated this the 1* day of January, 2014. ORDER Petitioner is the 6 accused in Crime No.196/2009 of Hosdurg Police Station pending as C.C.No.2153/2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Hosdurg. The offences alleged against the petitioner are punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 324, 326 r/w Section 149 IPC. Crl.M.C is filed seeking to quash Annexure-A2 final report and all further proceedings pursuant to it in Crime No.196/2009 of Hosdurg Police station. 2. There are altogether seven accused in the crime. Out of the seven accused, accused Nos.i to 5 and 7 faced trial and they were acquitted vide judgment dated 30.7.2013 in C.C.No.845/2009 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Hosdurg, a copy of which is marked for reference as Annexure-A3. The learned Magistrate after evaluating the evidence held that there is no evidence to connect the accused with the alleged offences. None of the eye witness identified the Bitar) 2014/KER/44 r:2:: Crl.M.C.No.3 Of 2014 culprits. The accused were found not guilty of the offence charged and they were acquitted under Section 248(1) Cr.P.C. The remaining accused is the petitioner herein. The case against the petitioner was split up and_- re-numbered~ as C.C.No.2153/2013. 3. Since the other accused except the petitioner were acquitted, for the very same set of reasons, this Court is of the view that no purpose would be served, even if the petitioner is asked to face the trial which will result in waste of judicial time. This Court is of the view that the petitioner is entitled to be acquitted as in the case of other accused who were tried and acquitted in C.C.No.845/2009. Accordingly, Crl.M.C is disposed of quashing the Annexure- A2 Final Report in Crime No.196/2009 of Hosdurg Police Station and all proceedings in C.C.No.2153/2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Hosdurg.
