RESPONDENT(S) EXHIBITS: NIL {TRUE COPY/ P.A TO JUDGE LSN eee RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.Y, J. 2OGTRER S368 \" CrLM.C.No. 4678 of 2016 Dated this the 01* day of August, 2016 ORDER The petitioners herein are the accused in C.P No.42 of 2003 of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Perinthalmanna. The aforesaid case had arisen from Crime No. 346 of 2002 of Perinthalmanna Police Station registered alleging offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 447, 341, 323, 324, 307 read with Sec.149 of the Indian Penal Code. 2. After investigation, the final report was laid before the jurisdictional Magistrate against the petitioners and 21 others. The petitioners were the accused Nos. 4 and 15 in the final report. The petitioners were not available for committal and the case against others were committed before the Court of Sessions. The trial was proceeded with against the aforesaid case and as per Annexure-B judgment dated 24.03.2007, all the other accused except the petitioners and accused No.3 were acquitted under Section 232 of the Code of Criminal eee 2016/KER/33668 Crl.M.C.No. 4678 of 2016 ; Procedure. Thereafter, the 3 accused surrendered before the learned Sessions Judge and the case against him was proceeded with in S.C No. 42 of 2008 and by Annexure-C judgment dated 17.04.2008, he was also found not guilty of the offences alleged against him and was liable to be acquitted. 3. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submits that in view of Annexure B and C judgments of the learned Sessions Judge, the substratum of case against the petitioners have been shattered. I have bestowed my _- anxious- considerations and submissions and have perused Annexures B and C judgments of the learned Sessions Judge. From para No.7 of Annexure-B judgment, it is discernible that the presence of some of the material witnesses could not be secured in spite of initiating coercive steps. PWs 1 to 4 did not support the prosecution case. Annexure-C judgment also tells the same story. eee 2016/KER/33668 Crl.M.C.No. 4678 of 2016 3 4. In Moosa v. Sub Inspector of Police (2006 (1) KLT 552) a Full Bench of this Court had occasion to hold that though the judgment rendered in the case of a co-accused and the reasoning of the judgment contained therein or appreciation of the evidence therein are not matters to be taken into account for the purpose of granting any relief to quash the proceedings and thus bar the trial itself, a case wherein the very substratum of the case is lost may be an exception to this rule. The same view was followed in the precedents cited supra. 5. I am of the firm view that no purpose is going to be served by directing the petitioners to face the trial at this stage. It can only be a futile exercise and the only purpose that will be served is to gnaw into precious time during which more productive work can be done by the court below. The prospects of conviction is extremely remote owing to the acquittal of the co accused. In the result this petition is allowed and all further proceedings against the petitioners in C.P No.42 eae apie 2016/KER/33668 Crl.M.C.No. 4678 of 2016 4 of 2003 on the files of the Judicial Magistrate of 1* Class- I,perinthalmanna, which has arisen from Crime No. 346 of 2002 of Perinthalmanna Police Station shall stand quashed.
