CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 07.01.2019, ALONG WITH Cr1.MC.7608/2018, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Bieae Crl.M.C. No.7608 & 7703/2018. 5 2019/KER/OI4 ORDER [ Crl1.MC 7608/2018 ,Cr1.MC.7703/2018 ] Crl.M.C.No.7608/2018 arises from Crime No. 58 of 2012 of Peringome Police station, for offences punishable under sections 143,147,148,341,323,324,506(ii), 354 read with section 149 IPC. Allegation of the prosecution is that, petitioners herein attacked the defacto complainants on 20/1/2012 at 11.45 a.m. It was alleged that, it was pursuant to a protest against running of a quarry. Respondents 1 to 3 are the defacto complainants. Now the matter is pending as CC No. 475/2013 of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class, Payyannur. 2. Cri.M.C. No.7703/2018 arises from Crime No.57/2012 of Peringom police station for offences punishable under sections 341,323,324,294(b), 506(ii), read with section 34IPC. Allegation of the prosecution is that petitioners herein attacked the defacto complainant on 20/1/2012 at 11.45 a.m. Matter is now pending as C.C.No.229/2013 of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class, Payyannur. 3. Accused in both the cases have approached this court to quash the proceedings on the basis of the settlement arrived at between the parties. To substantiate their statement, parties relied on the affidavit submitted by the defacto complainants. Blah Crl.M.C. No.7608 & 7703/2018. 6 2019/KER/OI4 4. It is seen that accused 1 and 2 in Crime No. 57/2012 are the defacto complainants in Crime No. 58/2012. Learned counsel on instructions submitted that parties have settled their disputes in both the cases and their statements have been recorded. 5.Considering the fact that, the petitioners have no criminal antecedents and the settlement arrived at between the parties is on record, I am inclined to quash the proceedings. Accordingly, Crl.M.Cs are allowed. All further proceedings pending as CC No. 475/2013 and 229/2013 of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class, Payyanur stand quashed.
