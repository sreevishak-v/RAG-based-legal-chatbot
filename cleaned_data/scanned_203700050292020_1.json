SRI.P.S.ANISHAD RESPONDENT/S: STATE OF KERALA REPRESENTED BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR, HIGH COURT OF KERALA, ERNAKULAM OTHER PRESENT: PP E.C.BINEESH THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 06.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Cr. MC.5029/2020 2 202 URERITIB V.G.ARUN, J. Dated this the 6\" day of January, 2020 ORDER Petitioner is the 2\" accused in Crime No.217 of 2018 of Thrissur West Police Station, registered for the offence punishable under Section 22(b)(ii)B of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substance Act. The crime was registered pursuant to the seizure of 2.60 Kilograms of dried ganja from the 1* accused. On questioning, the first accused stated that the petitioner was his accomplice and had escaped on seeing the Police. The petitioner was arrested on 12.11.2018 and granted bail subject to certain conditions, including the condition that the petitioner should not indulge in any other offence while on bail. Later, the prosecution sought cancellation of the bail alleging that the petitioner had violated the bail condition by getting involved in three crimes. According to the prosecution, Crime No.1122 of 2018 was registered against the petitioner and four others at the Kunnamkulam Police Station on 3.12.2018 for offences punishable under Section 143, 147, 148, 341, 308, 506 read with 149 IPC. Thereafter, Crime No.954 of 2019 was registered on 27.9.2019 for offences under Sections 447, 294B, 506 and 427 of IPC. Again, Crime No.997 of 2019 was registered on 12.12.2019 for the offences Cr. MC.5029/2020 3 202 URERITIB punishable under Sections 341, 323, 324, 294B and 506 of IPC. The petitioner opposed the application and produced some medical records to prove that, on all three occasions, he was admitted in hospitals, either on the date of occurrence of the alleged crime or on the subsequent days. It was contended that the petitioner was actually the victim and not the aggressor. The learned Sessions Judge repelled the objection and held that, irrespective of whether the petitioner suffered injuries in the incidents or not, the fact of the matter is that he had violated the bail condition by getting involved in the crimes. Based on the said finding, bail granted to the petitioner was cancelled as per Annexure-Al order dated 7.3.2020. 2. The learned counsel for the petitioner reiterated the contentions urged before the Sessions Court, of the petitioner being the victim in the three crimes and having been deliberately made an accused in order to make it appear that he had violated the bail condition. Relying on certain medical records, attempt was made to contend that, petitioner was not the aggressor and had been falsely implicated in the crimes. 3. As rightly held by the learned Sessions Judge, the Court need be concerned only about the petitioner's involvement in offences while he was on bail. This fact is amply established by registration of the crimes against him and it is impossible to believe that three different crimes were registered against the petitioner to make it appear that he Cr. MC.5029/2020 4 202 URERITIB had violated the bail condition. Hence, | find no reason to interfere with Annexure A1 order. In the result, the Crl.M.C is dismissed.
