RESPONDENT'S ANNEXURES:- NIL. HTRUE COPY// P.S. TO JUDGE rs. 2016/KER/68 B. KEMAL PASHA, J. re ane aye Ee ORDER On going through Annexure-A4 order passed by the court below, it seems that the court below has unnecessarily made a direction that the fact of the case pending against the applicant be endorsed in the Passport. A further direction is also made by the court below to the effect that the petitioner shall surrender the passport on its renewal within three days of obtaining the passport. It seems that the court has acted in a vengeance. The above said directions are out of place and it is not required to be made. This is not expected from a court of law also. Therefore, the said ee thee Bear 2016/KER/68 CRL.M.C.No. 8061 of 2015 2: directions contained in Annexure-A4 order are expunged. This Crl.M.C is disposed of as above.
