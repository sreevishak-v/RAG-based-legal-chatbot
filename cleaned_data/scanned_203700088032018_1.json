JUSTICE RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN V WEDNESDAY, THE O9TH DAY OF JANUARY 2019 / 19TH POUSHA, 1940 Cr1.MC.No. 8803 of 2018 CRIME NO. 738/2018 OF PERINTHALMANNA POLICEHK STATION, MALAPPURAM DISTRICT PETITIONER/ACCUSED: MOHAMMED ALIYAR, AGED 52 YEARS, S/O.MUHAMMED, MUDIYARAPUTHENPURAYIL HOUSE, PALAPPARAMBU, NILAMBUR, VADAPURAM, MALAPPURAM DISTRICT.

BY ADV. SRI.BINU V V VEETTIL VALAPPIL SRI T R RENJITH PP THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 09.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Ee at Zee ee Cr1.MC.No. 8803 of 2018 201S/KERII247 2 ORDER This petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (the Code for brevity). 2. The petitioner herein is the accused in C.C. No.794 of 2018 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Perinthalmanna. In the aforesaid case, he stands indicted for having committed offence punishable under Section 509 of the IPC and Section 120(0) of the Kerala Police Act, 2011. 3. The prosecution allegation is that the petitioner disseminated false accusations against one Selvakumar, who is his superior officer, and when the same was questioned by the de facto complainant, she was abused. 4. I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner, the 2\" respondent and the learned Public Prosecutor. It is submitted that the entire disputes between the parties have been amicably resolved. Reliance is placed on the affidavit filed by the 2\" respondent to buttress his submission. It is urged that the dispute is Pleiniaall Crl.MC.No. 8803 of 2018 2011KER/T247 3 purely personal in nature and would not affect public peace or tranquility. 5. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted that the statement of the 2\" respondent has been recorded and she has stated in clear terms that she has no subsisting grievance. 6. I have considered the submissions advanced. 7. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303] and in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466], the Apex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. 8. The offence committed by the petitioner cannot be said to be grave and serious having ingredients of extreme mental depravity. It also does not appear that the offence in this case will have a serious impact on the society. It is felt that quashing of proceedings on account of compromise would bring about peace and secure the ends of justice. Even otherwise, persisting with the prosecution would be nothing, but a waste of time as the prospects of conviction is bleak. Pleiniaall Crl.MC.No. 8803 of 2018 2011KER/T247 4 Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I am of the considered view that this Court will be well justified in invoking its extraordinary powers under Section 482 of the Code to quash the proceedings. In the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-Al FIR and all proceedings pursuant thereto against the petitioner now pending as C.C. No. 794/2018 on the file of Judicial Magistrate of First Class-I, Perinthalmanna are quashed.
