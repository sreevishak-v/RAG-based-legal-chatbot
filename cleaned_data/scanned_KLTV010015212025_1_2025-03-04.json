No.643/2025 (Crime No.127/2025 of Vattiyoorkkavu Police Station) Petitioners/Accused Nos. 1 and 2 :- 1. Abi, aged 25 years, S/o Vinod, residing at TC.38/2640(3), KRA 126, Konathukulangara, Arapura, Vattiyoorkavu P.O, Thiruvananthapuram District 2. Rahul, aged 20 years, S/o Remesh, residing at Flat No.318, Rajaji Nagar, Thampanoor Ward, Thycadu Village, Thiruvananthapuram By Advocates:-K.S. Gopinathan Nair, K.G Rajesh and Vijayakrishnan.G Counter Petitioners:- 1. State of Kerala 2. The Station House Officer, Vattiyoorkavu Police Station By Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumary This petition came up for hearing on 03/03/2025 and the court on 04/03/2025 passed the following : Criminal M.C.No.643/2025 1/6 ORDER This is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail. 2. The petitioners are alleged to have committed the offences punishable under Sections 126(2), 115(), 117(2) and 118(2), r/w Section 3(5) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, and Crime No. 127/2025 of Vattiyoorkavu Police Station is registered against the petitioners arraying them as accused Nos. 1 and 2. 3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- On 07.02.2025 at about 9.45 p.m., inside Surendra Bar, situated at Manchadimoodu, Vattiyoorkavu, a wordy altercation occurred between the husband of the defacto complainant and accused Nos.1 and 2, and thereafter, accused Nos.1 and 2 fisted and beat on the face of the victim, pulled him down and kicked him repeatedly. When the victim went out of the Bar, accused Nos.1 and 2 along with the 3 accused wrongfully restrained him, and at that time, the 1* accused fisted on the face of the victim repeatedly, using an iron bangle, causing fracture to his nasal bone. When the victim fell down, accused Nos. 2 to 6 beat, fisted and kicked on various parts of his body. Criminal M.C.No.643/2025 2/6 4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The Investigating Officer filed report and additional report opposing the pre-arrest bail application. 5. Heard. Perused the records. 6. The only point to be considered is, whether pre-arrest bail can be granted to the petitioners/accused Nos. 1 and 2. 7. The Point:- The defacto complainant is the wife of the victim. The petitioners/ accused Nos. 1 and 2 along with the other accused are alleged to have manhandled and attacked the victim, using an iron bangle, causing injuries. The alleged incident has happened inside and outside a Bar, and the motive for the incident is the enmity that arose, when a wordy altercation occurred between the victim and the accused persons. 8. According to the petitioners, they are innocent of the allegations levelled against them and they have been falsely implicated in this crime due to the mistaken identity. 9. There is serious allegation as against the petitioners. It is seen from the report filed by the Investigating Officer that, the petitioners/ accused Nos. 1 and 2 along with the other accused had fisted and beaten the victim, and the 1* Criminal M.C.No.643/2025 3/6 accused, by using an iron bangle, hit on his face, causing serious injuries. In the accident register-cum-wound certificate appended with the report filed by the Investigating Officer, it is seen that, the victim sustained comminuted fracture of frontal process of maxilla, displaced fracture of right nasal bone and undisplaced fracture of left nasal bone. It is stated in the report that the wound certificate and the treatment certificate of the victim were obtained. It is also stated in the report that the recovery of the weapon used for the commission of the offence is to be effected. The counsel for the petitioners argued that, the petitioners are not involved in the crime, and in fact, the identity of the petitioners are not stated in the First Information Statement. It is relevant to note that the First Information Statement was given by the wife of the injured, who is not connected to this incident. Further, the learned Public Prosecutor submitted that the involvement of the accused is made out on verification of the CCTV footage. The Investigating Officer has filed an additional report to that effect stating that the petitioners/ accused Nos. 1 and 2 are implicated on questioning the friend of the injured and also on verification of CCTV footage. So, the prosecution has made out a prima facie case against the petitioners/ accused Nos. 1 and 2 and regarding the involvement of the petitioners in the alleged offence. The investigation is progressing. It is stated in the report that the petitioners are involved in other Criminal M.C.No.643/2025 4/6 crimes. Considering the facts stated in the report to the effect that the petitioners are involved in the offence, it appears that exceptional jurisdiction to grant a pre- arrest bail cannot be exercised in this case. 10. In Jai Prakash Singh v. State of Bihar and Another (2012 (4) SCC 379), the Honble Apex court has held that, an order of pre-arrest bail being an extra ordinary privilege, should be granted only in exceptional cases. It is settled in law that arrest should be the last option and it should be restricted to cases where arrest is imperative in the facts and circumstances of a case and consistent view is that the grant of anticipatory bail shall be restricted to exceptional circumstances. So it is clear that the power to grant anticipatory bail under section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita is an exceptional power and should be exercised only in exceptional cases and not as a matter of course. Its object is to ensure that a person should not be harassed or humiliated in order to satisfy the grudge or personal vendetta of the complainant. [Reliance placed on the decision rendered by the Honble Apex Court in HDFC Bank Limited v. J.J. Mannan and Another (2010 (1) SCC 679); Srikant Upadhyay v. State of Bihar (2024 KHC Online 6137)]. In the case at hand, I find no exceptional circumstance to exercise the exceptional power of granting anticipatory bail. 11. Considering the serious allegation against the petitioners and gravity Criminal M.C.No.643/2025 5/6 of the offence, it appears that granting the petitioners with an order of anticipatory bail will adversely affect the investigation. If an order of anticipatory bail is granted they are likely to influence the witnesses and tamper with the evidence. Considering all these aspects, this court is not inclined to grant an order of pre- arrest bail to the petitioners. In the result, this petition is dismissed. Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and pronounced by me in Open Court on this the 4\" day of March, 2025.
