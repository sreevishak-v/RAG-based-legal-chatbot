BABU JOSE = CRL.M.C.NO.5699 OF 2020 2021/KER/1372 2 OTHER PRESENT: SR.PP.C.S.HRITHWIK THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 08.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: CRL.M.C.NO.5699 OF 2020 ; 202 UKERM372 ORDER Dated this the 8th day of January 2021 Petitioners are accused Nos.1 to 3 in Crime No.556/2020 registered at the Coyalmannam Police Station, Palakkad for offence punishable under Section 435 of IPC. The de facto complainant, at whose instance the crime was registered, is arrayed as the 2nd respondent. Annexure-B affidavit has been filed by 2\" respondent stating that the dispute, which was the reason for the incident and registration of the crime, has been resolved amicably and he has no subsisting grievance against the petitioners. 2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also, who, on instructions, submits that the petitioners have no criminal antecedents. CRL.M.C.NO.5699 OF 2020 ; 202 UKERM372 3. Having considered the gravity of the offences alleged, nature of the damage caused and having perused the affidavits filed by the 2\"* respondent, the contents of which are submitted to be true and voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled and no public interest is involved in this matter. Moreover, in view of the settlement, possibility of the criminal proceedings ending in conviction is remote. As such, continuance of the proceedings will amount to an abuse of process of court and hence, in view of the legal position set out by the Honourable Supreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is no impediment in granting the relief sought. CRL.M.C.NO.5699 OF 2020 . 202 1U/KER/372 In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. Annexure A FIR and the proceedings in Crime No.556/2019 of Coyalmannam Police Station is quashed.
