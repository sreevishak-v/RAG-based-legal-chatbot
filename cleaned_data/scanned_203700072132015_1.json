RESPONDENTS' ANNEXURES:-NIL KRJ //TRUE COPY// P.A TO JUDGE an 2016/KER/23873 RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.YV, J ~ CrLM.CNo.7213 of 2015 Dated \"Tune, 2016 ORDER The petitioner herein is the sole accused in C.C No. 1555 of 2005 on the files of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class-I, Cherthala involving offences punishable under Sections 409, 468, 471 and A77A of the Indian Penal Code. The crux of the prosecution allegation is that petitioner while working as manager of Vyaya Bank committed misappropriation of money. 2. In this petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, petitioner seeks to quash Annexure-4 application filed by Assistant Public Prosecutor under Section 173 (8) of the Cr.P.C for ordering further investigation in the above case. 3. I have heard learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the learned Public Prosecutor. an 2016/KER/23873 Crl.MC.7213/15 123+ 4. Referring to Annexure-1 order of this Court in Crl.R.P No. 629 of 2014, it is submitted by learned counsel for the petitioner that on an earlier occasion, the de facto complainant had approached this Court when the application submitted for further investigation was rejected by the learned Magistrate. This Court had passed certain directions, but did not interfere with the findings. It is submitted that later the petitioner submitted an application for expeditious trial of the proceedings and as per Annexure-2 order dated 15.01.2015 this Court had issued directions to the learned Magistrate to try and dispose off the case as expeditiously as possible. The learned counsel also submitted that several applications are being filed before the learned Magistrate in order to protract the trial which would cause irreparable hardship. It is pointed out that the criminal proceedings are pending since 2008 and the intention of the de facto complainant is to protract the matter on one reason or the other. It is further submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that Hard Beier 2016/KER/23873 Crl.MC.7213/15 ~:3:- Disk of the server of the Vijaya Bank, Cherthala was forwarded to the 2\" respondent , for obtaining expert report in the year 2015 and the same was received by the lab authorities on 18.6.2015. However, till date the report has not been submitted before Court. 5. Learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submits that trial was being proceeded in an expeditious manner pursuant to Annexure- 2 order of this Court. However, it is submitted that the report from the Forensic Science Laboratory 1s awaited. 6. After having heard the rival submissions, I am of the view that this Court will not be justified in quashing an application filed under Section 173(8) of the CrP.C by the Assistant Public Prosecutor. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner prays that a direction be issued to the learned Magistrate to consider the maintainability of the application as well , in view of Annexure-1 order of this Court . I take note of the fact that the learned Magistrate has not even passed an order in the said application . It is for the Beier 2016/KER/23873 Crl.MC.7213/15 -~24:- learned Magistrate to consider the application on its merit and to pass appropriate orders. Needless to mention, the contention of the petitioner, that no such application is maintainable shall also be considered. 8. Insofar as the prayer for expeditious trial is concerned, this Court as per Annexure-2 order in Crl.M.C No.269 of 2015 have already issued direction to the learned Magistrate to take earnest efforts to try and dispose of the case expeditiously. No further directions are required in view of the above order. 9. The Director of Regional Forensic Laboratory, Thiruvananthapuram is arrayed as the second respondent herein and it is borne out from records that Hard Disk of the Vijaya Bank was forwarded for the purpose of obtaining expert report. It is submitted by the learned Public Prosecutor that the Hard Disk was received by the Forensic Laboratory on 18.06.2015. More than a year has elapsed and as the offence involved is fabrication and manipulation el patel apes 2016/KER/23873 Crl.MC.7213/15 ~5:- of electronic records concerning a bank. I am of the view that necessary direction are to be issued to the second respondent to expedite the analysis of the Hard Disk and to submit a report before the jurisdictional Magistrate. Efforts shall be taken to submit the report within a period of two months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order. Crl.M.C is disposed off accordingly. Sd/- RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.V JUDGE krj."
