ANNEXURE A3 THE AFFIDAVIT SWORN BY THE 3RD RESPONDENT BEFORE THIS HON'BLE COURT. RESPONDENT(S)' ANNEXURES NIL /TRUE COPY/ VPS PS. TO JUDGE BEAR RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.Y, J NOD Dated this the 3\" day of October, 2016 ORDER 1.This petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short 'Code') has been preferred by the petitioners herein for quashing the proceedings pending against them as C.P.No.38 of 2016 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate of the First Class, Koilandy. In the said case, they stand indicted for offences punishable under Sections 341, 323, 294(b), 506(2), 308, 427 read with Section 34 of the IPC. 2.The prosecution allegation is that on 23.8.2015 at 8 a.m., while the de facto complainant was returning back in a bike, the petitioners herein are alleged to have wrongfully restrained him and after abusing him assaulted him with their hands. It is further alleged that the 3 accused in the aforesaid case had attempted to hit the de facto complainant with an iron rod on his head and if he had not evaded the blow, the accused would have been guilty of ap 2016/KER/42227 Crl.M.C.6232/2016 2 culpable homicide not amounting to murder. 3.Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners, the 3 respondent as well as the learned Public Prosecutor. 4.It is submitted by the learned counsel appearing for the 3 respondent that the disputes have been amicably resolved. Reference is also made to Annexure-A3 affidavit sworn to by him wherein it is asserted that the dispute does not subsist any more. 5.The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submits that in view of the settlement arrived at between the parties, this Court will be justified in quashing the proceedings. According to the learned counsel, the only allegation is that the 3% accused made an attempt to strike the 3% respondent and the prosecution has no case that any injury was sustained. 6.The learned Public Prosecutor on instructions submits that the 4 accused is involved in another case. However, insofar as the other accused are concerned, no previous ap 2016/KER/42227 Crl.M.C.6232/2016 3 antecedents are reported. 7.In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and Another [2012 (10)SCC 303], the Apex Court has crystalised the position in respect of the powers vested in the High Court under S.482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, to quash criminal proceedings. It was held that the power vested in the High Court under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, is not limited to quashing proceedings within the ambit and scope of Section 320 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The three - Judge Bench in the above case, clearly expounded, that quashing of criminal proceedings under S.482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, could also be based on settlements between private parties, and could also on a compromise between the offender and the victim. Only that, the above power did not extend to crimes against the society. It is also relevant to mention, that the jurisdiction vested in the High Court under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, for quashing criminal proceedings, was held to be exercisable in soramenran7 Crl.M.C.6232/2016 4 criminal cases having an overwhelming and predominatingly civil flavour, particularly offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership, or such like transactions. Or even offences arising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or family disputes where the wrong is basically private or personal. In all such cases, the parties should have resolved their entire dispute by themselves, mutually. Further, guidelines were issued by the Apex Court in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [2014 (6) SCC 466] and recently in Rajesh Kamath J. and Others v. Mohana Kurup and Others [AIR 2016 SC 2452]. 8.I have considered the rival submissions and I have gone through the materials on record. The offence committed by the petitioners cannot be said to be grave and serious having ingredients of extreme mental depravity. It also does not appear that the offence in this case will have a serious impact on the society. More over, when the party respondents have settled the matter, the possibility of LER] 2016/KER/42227 Crl.M.C.6232/2016 5 conviction is remote and bleak and the continuation of the criminal case against the petitioners would be a futile exercise. It would also put the petitioners and the party respondents to great oppression and prejudice. Though the 4\" accused is said to be involved in another case as well, taking note of the allegations in the instant case, I am of the view that there is no reason to deny the prayer sought for. 9.Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I am of the considered view that this Court will be well justified in invoking its extra ordinary powers under Section 482 of the Code to quash the proceedings. In the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure- A2 final report and all proceedings pursuant thereto against the petitioners now pending as C.P.No.38 of 2016 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate of the First Class, Koilandy are quashed.
