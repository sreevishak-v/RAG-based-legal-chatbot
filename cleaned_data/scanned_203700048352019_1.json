CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 08.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: CRL.M.C.No.4835 of 2019 2 2021/KERI273 ORDER Dated this the 8th day of January 2021 This Crl.M.C. is filed to quash the entire proceedings in C.C.No.101 of 2018 on the file of the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Thodupuzha. 2. The above case is charge sheeted by the Muttom Police against the petitioner and another alleging offences punishable under Sections 406, 420, 468 and 471 r/w. Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code(IPC). 3. The prosecution case in brief is as follows: The defacto complainant is the registered owner of a BMW 530 D Car bearing NO.KL-43-A-6677. The defacto complainant borrowed an amount of Rs.5,50,000/- from the 1** accused. As a lien for the said amount, the defacto complainant handed over the said car to the 1* accused on CRL.M.C.No.4835 of 2019 3 2021/KERI273 13.12.2013. Thereafter, the defacto complainant went to abroad to continue his business. After two years of the above transaction, the defacto complainant came back from abroad. He was ready to return the money which was borrowed from the 1%* accused to get back his vehicle which was under the possession of the 1% accused. The 1** accused informed that, he has transferred the vehicle to the 3? accused. He informed that, now the vehicle is under the police custody in connection with Crime No.502 of 2016 of Kanjar Police Station. Hence, Annexure Al complaint was filed before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-1, Thodupuzha. The said complaint was forwarded to the Police by the learned Magistrate under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. and accordingly Annexure A2 F.I.R. was registered. Thereafter, Annexure A3 final report was filed by the Police against the petitioner and other accused. 4. Heard the learned counsel for the CRL.M.C.No.4835 of 2019 4 2021/KERI273 petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor. 5. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that, even if the entire allegations in Annexure A3 final report is accepted in toto, no offence is made out against the petitioner who is the 2\"* accused. The counsel submitted that, even if the statement of witnesses cited by the prosecution, which was recoded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. is accepted, there is no allegation against the petitioner. The counsel submitted that, prima facie, no offence is made out against the petitioner. 6. The learned Public Prosecutor submitted that, in the final report, it is stated that, the petitioner and the other accused together committed the offence and therefore, this Court may not quash the proceedings against the petitioner alone. 7. After hearing both sides, I think, this Cr1.M.C. can be disposed of allowing the CRL.M.C.No.4835 of 2019 5 2021/KERI273 petitioner to file a discharge petition before the lower court. If so, it would be better to the trial court to peruse the records filed by the prosecution and can decide whether any prima facie case is made out or not against the petitioner. All the contentions raised by the petitioner in this Crl.M.cC. are left open. The petitioner is free to raise all these contentions before the lower court. In the facts and circumstances of this case, the learned Magistrate will give an exemption from personal appearance before the lower court except when his presence is inevitable, if such an application to that effect is filed by the petitioner. Therefore, this Crl.M.C. is disposed of with the following directions: 1) Tf the petitioner file an application for discharge, the learned Magistrate will consider the same and pass appropriate orders in accordance to law if CRL.M.C.No.4835 of 2019 6 2021/KERI273 the charge is not framed so far. If the above application is filed by the petitioner within one month from today, the learned Magistrate will dispose of the same as expeditiously as possible, at any rate, within six weeks from the date of receipt of that application; ii) If an application is filed by the petitioner for exemption from personal appearance, the learned Magistrate will allow the same in accordance to law.
