No.566/2025 (Crime No.179/2025 of Kadinamkulam Police Station) Petitioner/Accused :- Basharulla. M aged 45 years, S/o Mohammed Illias, residing at Oottuvilakam, Perumathura, Thiruvananthapuram District By Advocate:-S. Binukumar Counter Petitioner/Respondent:- The Station House Officer, Kadinamkulam Police Station By Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumary This petition came up for hearing on 25/02/2025 and the court on 28/02/2025 passed the following : ORDER This is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail. 2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed an offence punishable under Section 318(4) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, and Crime No. 179/2025 of Criminal M.C.No.566/2025 1/5 Kadinamkulam Police Station is registered against the petitioner arraying him as the accused. 3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- The accused, with an intention to obtain wrongful gain and to cause wrongful loss to the Jama-Ath, while acting as its General Secretary, from 11.03.2023 to 25.09.2024, misappropriated a sum of Rs.1,09,144/- in the fund. Thereafter, the accused remitted back only a sum of Rs.20,000/- to the account of the Jama-Ath Committee, and not remitted the balance amount of Rs.89,144/-, and thereby committed cheating. 4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The Investigating Officer filed report opposing the anticipatory bail application. 5. Heard. Perused the records. 6. The only point to be considered is, whether an order of anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioner/ accused. 7. The Point:- The petitioner/accused was the General Secretary of the Muslim Jama-Ath Committee, Perumathura. The petitioner / accused is alleged to have misappropriated a sum of Rs.1,09,144/- in the fund of Jama-Ath Committee, Criminal M.C.No.566/2025 2/5 and on detecting the said misappropriation, he remitted back an amount of Rs.20,000/- and not remitted the balance amount of Rs.89,144/-. 8. The petitioner submits that, he is absolutely innocent of the allegations levelled against him. It is submitted that, the petitioner held the post as District Working President of Indian National League and General Secretary of Perumathura Muslim Jama-Ath, during the period from March 2023 to November 2024, and while so, a lady had lodged a complaint against the President of the Jama-Ath alleging sexual harassment, and since no action was taken by the police, he criticized the concerned police officials, while attending a channel discussion, and infuriated by this, the President and present Secretary of the Jama-Ath raised false allegations, including misappropriation of money from Jama-Ath, against the petitioner, and influenced the police, and thereafter, falsely implicated him in the present crime. 9. There is no serious allegation as against the petitioner. Allegedly, in the capacity of the General Secretary of the Muslim Jama-Ath Committee, he had misappropriated the money collected by him. There is no materials on record to substantiate the allegations in the petition. So there is no prima facie case against the petitioner. The involvement of the petitioner in the alleged offence is not brought out by the prosecution at this stage. It is stated in the report filed by the Criminal M.C.No.566/2025 3/5 Investigating Officer that applications were filed for getting the account details. It is not stated that there is anything to recover from the petitioner/accused. It would be a travesty of justice, if the petitioner is put behind bars, if actually no offence is committed by him. Considering all these aspects, it appears that this is a fit case where pre-arrest bail can be granted to the petitioner. 10. In view of my discussion above, it appears that there is no impediment in granting a pre-arrest bail to the petitioner. Considering all these aspects, it is found that this is a fit case where a pre-arrest bail can be granted to the petitioner. In the result, the petition is allowed on the following conditions:- (1) In the event of arrest, the petitioner/ accused shall be released on bail on her executing bond for Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) with two solvent sureties for the like sum each to the satisfaction of the arresting officer/Investigating Officer, as the case may be. (2) Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. on every Thursday for a period of 3 (three) months or till the filing of the final report, whichever is earlier. Criminal M.C.No.566/2025 4/5 (3) Petitioner shall also appear before the Investigating Officer as and when required. (4) Petitioner shall not commit any offence while on bail. (5) Petitioner shall not attempt to contact the defacto complainant or any of the prosecution witnesses, directly or through any other person, or in any other way try to tamper with the evidence or influence any witnesses or other persons related to the investigation. In case of any violation of the above conditions or misuse of liberty, the prosecution or the defacto complainant is at liberty to approach jurisdictional court for cancellation of bail.
