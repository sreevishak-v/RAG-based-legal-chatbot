The offences alleged are punishable under Sections 341, 323, 324, 452, 427 read with Section 34 of IPC. 2. There are altogether three accused in the case. Accused Nos.1 and 2 faced trial and were acquitted in C.C.No.1269/2009. A copy of the judgment dated 29.09.2012 is produced as Annexure A2. The learned Magistrate found that the material witnesses failed to support the prosecution case about the involvement of the accused in the occurrence. The learned Prosecutor has justifiably given up the remaining witnesses. The court therefore found that, the prosecution failed to prove the guilty of the accused persons and they were found not guilty. In the facts and circumstances, no purpose will be served by prosecuting the petitioner. Hence, the Crl.M.C is allowed. All further proceedings in Crime No.493/2009 of Vadanappilly Police Station pending as L.P.No.70/2013 in C.C.No.1117/2012 on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Chavakkad is quashed.
