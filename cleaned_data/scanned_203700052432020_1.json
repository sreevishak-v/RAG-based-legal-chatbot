JUSTICE P.SOMARAJAN MONDAY, THE O4TH DAY OF JANUARY 2021 / 14TH POUSHA, 1942 Cr1.MC.No.5243 OF 2020(5) CRIME NO.1581/2018 OF Kazhakkuttom Police Station , Thiruvananthapuram PETITIONERS /2ND ACCUSED: NEETHU.R AGED 28 YEARS D/O.

CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 04.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Crl.MC.No.5243 OF 2020 (8) 202 1/KER/83 2 ORDER The accused No.2 came up against the Annexure A4 order passed under Section 451 Cr.P.C partly allowing release of certain articles seized from her. The gold ornaments and the cash comes to Rs.1,08,940/- (Rupees one lakh eight thousand nine hundred and forty only) were not released by the learned Magistrate. Aggrieved by the said order, accused No.2 came up under Section 482 Cr.P.C. 2. The allegation levelled against both the accused Nos. 1 and 2 prima facie appears to be very serious as there is involvement of seventeen persons and an amount of Rs.39,00,000/- (Rupees thirty nine lakhs only) received under the guise of promise to sell the property owned by somebody else. It is submitted that, accused No.1 in fact is doing a business of real estate, for which, he used to enter into agreement with owners of the property, but no such agreement is produced. Accused No.2 is a lady. The allegation levelled Crl.MC.No.5243 OF 2020 (8) 2021/KERI83 3 against accused No.2 is that, she is also a participant, and received the amount on various occasions under the guise of promise to give the property. An order passed under Section 451 Cr.P.C is an interim order and always would stand subject to an order, that may be passed under Section 452 Cr.P.C. Certain articles were released by the learned Magistrate and some other articles which includes gold ornaments and the amount retained on sufficient reason. As such, there is no ground for exhausting the inherent power under Section 482 Cr.P.C. The Crl1.M.C. is hereby dismissed. Sd/- P.
