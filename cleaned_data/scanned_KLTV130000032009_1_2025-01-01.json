The person cheated must be dishonestly induced to a. Deliver property to any person; or b. Make, alter or destroy valuable security or anything signed or sealed and capable of being converted into valuable security. 46. While analysing the oral evidence of witnesses ,it can be seen that there is no direct evidence which shows that accused no.2 had run the chitty business and the bank and collected money .The oral evidence confined to the accused no.1 and not accused no.2 .Though PW163 states that accused no. and 2 were running the business ,he in the examination in chief it self stated that he has not complained to any authorities .He denied his statement before the police .when he was asked about the role of accused no.2 in the cross examination he responded that alao@] amos amog@mle! 25168 MI@ad Eso) o/s) ANZA] B@ suMDvOJoe(Q ) @erloe (A) . According to him he posses no documents pertaining to the alleged transaction .The evidence of him when analysed with other evidence cannot be relied Moreover the PW192 admitted 14 of 23 that Ext P18,registration form does not contain the name of the accused no.2,i.e,in the registration form itself shows the name of accused no.1 and not the accused no2 as its responsible person. 47, Prosecution had not adduced any doment to show that the accused no.2 was authorized foreman of the chitty fund institution or he has run the bank. As per Ext. P19 the managing director of the said bank is accused no.1. There is no direct evidence to show that the accused no2 received money and misappropriated it .On analysing the oral as well as the documentary evidence adduced by the prosecution the role of accused no.2 cannot be said to have proved by the prosecution with respect to the offence w/s.420 IPC . 48.The another allegation is that the accused has committed the offence u/s.17 of Kerala Money Lenders Act 1958 .Section 17: Penalty for carrying on business without licence or in violation of the conditions of licence. 49. Whoever carries on the business of money lending without a licence or in violation of the conditions of the licence or otherwise than in conformity with the terms and conditions of the licence shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which, in the absence of special reasons to be recorded in the judgement of the court, shall not be less than three months but which may extend to three years and with fine which may extend to fifty thousand rupees..] 15 of 23 50. The defence case is that the accused no.2 is a KSRTC employee .More over the prosecution has not adduced any evidence to prove that the accused no2 was running the business without any valid license .Ext P18 form issued in the name of accused no.1 .The Ext P7 rent deed was executed by accused no.1, Ext. P19 issued by the district registrar in which the accused no.1 is the foreman,the Ext P18 Form A which shows that the firm was registered in the year 1985,i.e before the death of P.K.Kunju . The details of partners after the death of him or after the reconstitution of the firm were not produced .Furthermore there is no evidence to show that the accused no.2 was running the business . Hence it cannot be said that the accused no.2 without valid license run the firm. The available evidence on record is hardly sufficient to find that the accused no.2 committed any offence u/s. 420 read with 34 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 and 4(2) read with section 17 of Money Lenders Act, 1958 as alleged by the prosecution beyond any reasonable doubt . For said reasons point nos. 1 and 2 are found against the prosecution. 51. Point No.3 :- Upon the finding in point nos. 1 and 2, accused No.2 is found not guilty of offences punishable under sections 420 read with 34 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 and 4(2) read with section 17 of Money Lenders Act, 1958 and he is acquitted of the said offences under section 248(1) of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.
