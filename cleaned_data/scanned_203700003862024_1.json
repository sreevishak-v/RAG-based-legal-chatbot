BY ADVS. SUBI K. ARUN JOSE THOMAS RESPONDENT/STATE : STATE OF KERALA REPRESENTED BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR, HIGH COURT OF KERALA, ERNAKULAM, PIN - 682031 SRI. M.C. ASHI (PP) THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 19.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: ape 2024/KER/4154 CRL.MC_386/2024 2 BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J eee i ee ORDER Petitioner challenges condition No.2 in the order dated 23.12.2023 of the Additional Sessions Court, Palakkad. 2. Petitioner is involved in an offence punishable under Section 20(b)(ii)(B) of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 [for short, NDPS Act?]. Prosecution alleged that the petitioner was found in illegal possession of 1.990 Kgs. of ganja, and he was arrested on 11.10.2023. 3. On 23.12.2023, the learned Session Judge granted him bail but imposed a condition that one of the sureties must be the parent or near relative of the petitioner, and further that they shall produce the original title deed to prove that he or she is solvent. Of course, it was specified that the original title deed would be returned after verifying it with the photocopy. 4. Adv.Subi.K., the learned counsel for the petitioner, submitted Blea 2024/KER/4154 CRL.MC 386/2024 3 that the parents or near relatives of the petitioner are not solvent, and therefore, they cannot produce the original title deed to prove their solvency. It was further submitted that the insistence on one of the sureties to be a parent or a near relative is prejudicial and renders the order granting bail practically impossible to comply with. It was submitted that due to the inability to comply with the said condition, petitioner continues to remain in jail even today, and umless the said condition is deleted, the petitioner would be prejudiced. 5. Sri.Ashi.M.C., the learned Public Prosecutor, opposed the deletion of the said condition and submitted that the same is reasonable and even necessary, since the offence committed by the petitioner is under the NDPS Act. 6. Conditions in an order granting bail cannot be too onerous or incapable of performance. Insisting on sureties is only a means to ensure that the accused will appear during trial. Even if the surety is not a parent or a near relative, if in case the petitioner absconds, proceedings can be initiated against the Blea 2024/KER/4154 CRL.MC 386/2024 4 surety. In fact, the conditions imposed in the instant case do stipulate the petitioner to surrender his passport. Therefore, the insistence on the parent or near relative being a surety for the grant of bail is not a reasonable condition in the present scenario, especially when the petitioner contends that his parents and near relatives are not solvent. 7. Since the petitioner asserts that his parents and near relatives are not solvent, the condition directing one of the sureties to be his parent or a near relative, is too onerous in the peculiar circumstances of the case. However, in order to ensure the availability of the petitioner and to ensure his presence, the condition to be deleted ought to be substituted with another condition that he shall file an undertaking in the form of an affidavit providing his mobile phone number and an undertaking that he will not change the said number until conclusion of trial. 8. Therefore, condition No.2 in the order dated 23.12.2023 in Crl.M.P.No.6435/2023 on the files of the Additional Sessions Court, Palakkad shall stand deleted and it will be substituted BER 2024/KER/4154 CRL.MC 386/2024 5 with the following condition: 2, Petitioner shall file an affidavit providing his mobile phone number and an undertaking that the said number shall not be changed until conclusion of trial. The Crl.M.C.is allowed as above. sd/- BECHU KURIAN THOMAS JUDGE AMV/20/01/2024 pS By a 4 2024/KER/4154 CRL.MC_386/2024 6 APPENDIX OF CRL.MC 386/2024 PETITIONER ANNEXURES ANNEXURE- 1 TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER DTD. 23/12/2023 IN CRL.M.P.NO.6435 OF 2023 IN $.C.NO.1161 OF 2023 IN CRIME NO.63 OF 2023 OF EXCISE ENFORCEMENT AND ANTI NARCOTIC SPECIAL SQUAD, PALAKKAD ON THE FILES OF ADDITIONAL SESSIONS JUDGE-II, PALAKKAD DISTRICT.
