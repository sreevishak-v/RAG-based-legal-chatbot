Nos. 5826, 5835 & 5838 of 2016 | Dated this the 3 day of October, 2016 ORDER These proceedings are initiated by the accused in Crime Nos.738 of 2016, 863 of 2016 and 864 of 2016 of Paravoor Police Station. 2. In Criminal Miscellaneous Case No.5835 of 2016, the case of the de facto complainant is that on 16.05.2016, at 9.00 pm, the accused = in furtherance of the common intention trespassed into the residential house of the de facto complainant and when she objected to it, they attacked her, assaulted her, tore her blouse and_ thereby, attempted to outrage her modesty. When the husband interfered, he was also assaulted with a reaper. The complaint was laid and crime was registered for offences punishable under Sections 452, 354, 323, Bueee 2016/KER/42215 Cri.M.C. Nos. 5826, 5835 & 5838 of 2016 ob: 324, 427 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. 3. In Criminal Miscellaneous Case No.5838 of 2016, the 2\"? accused in Crime No.863 of 2016 is the de facto complainant. Her case is that on 16.05.2016, at about 9.15 pm, the accused herein attempted to damage a car parked near the residence of the de facto complainant and attempted to beat the de facto complainant using an iron rod. The 2\" and 3 accused had hit with an iron rod causing bodily injuries to him and his brother. The crime was registered against three persons, who are the accused herein. In the nature of the allegations raised in these cases, it is clear that they are case and counter case. 4. In Criminal Miscellaneous Case No.5826 of Bueee 2016/KER/42215 Cri.M.C. Nos. 5826, 5835 & 5838 of 2016 3; 2016, the 1* accused in Crime No.864 of 2016 is the sole accused. The de facto complainant therein is the complainant in Crime No.864 of 2016. The allegation of the de facto complainant therein is that on 11.03.2016, at about 10.3@ pm the accused trespassed into the residential house of the de facto complainant, abused him and pushed him down, to the verandha, tore his shirt and assaulted him. It is alleged that some household articles were also damaged. On the basis of the complaint lodged, crime was registered and after investigation final report was laid and the matter is pending as C.C. No.738 of 2016. 5. The respective accused in all the three cases have approached this Court with these cases contending that the dispute between the parties have Bupe 2016/KER/42215 Cri.M.C. Nos. 5826, 5835 & 5838 of 2016 as been resolved amicably and voluntarily. The affidavits filed by the respective de _ facto complainants and the victims have been filed in each of the above case. The learned counsel for the de facto complainant in the respective cases, relying on the affidavits filed by the aggrieved persons, contended that they indicate the true and correct facts and reiterated the averments in_- the affidavits. It was contended that they do not intend to pursue the respective cases. 6. The learned Public Prosecutor on instructions submitted that the parties are not involved in any other crime and that parties have resolved their disputes. Having heard the learned counsel for the respective petitioners and the respondents and the learned Public Prosecutor, I am api 2016/KER/42215 Cri.M.C. Nos. 5826, 5835 & 5838 of 2016 -: 55- satisfied that the parties have resolved their disputes. In the interest of justice, a premature termination of the entire proceedings is warranted. Hence I am inclined to invoke Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and quash the entire proceedings. In the result, all the Criminal Miscellaneous Cases are allowed and Crime Nos.738 of 2016, 863 of 2016 and 864 of 2016 of Paravoor Police Station will stand quashed.
