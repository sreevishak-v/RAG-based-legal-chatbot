The revision petitioner was convicted and sentenced by the trial court under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (in short, 'the N.|.Act'). The above said conviction and sentence were confirmed in appeal. In the revision petition filed against the conviction and sentence, this Court as per Annexure-Al order dated soianennes Cri. M.C. No.4816 of 2015 i 2t 11.07.2008 in Cri.R.P.No.2330/2008 confirmed the conviction and modified the sentence to a fine of Rs.4,00,000/- with a default clause for simple imprisonment for three months. A period of seven months was granted to the petitioner to pay the fine. 3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner. 4. In this Crl.M.C., the second prayer has become infructuous due to the passage of time. In view of the direction of this Court as per Annexure-Al order, if the amount is not paid, the petitioner will naturally be arrested in execution of the sentence. However, in view of the decision of this Court in Subhash Sait v. Sree Gokulam Chits and Finance, Palakkad & Another [2015 (4) KHC 741], there is no need to pass any order by this Court for the petitioner to pay the fine even after the period stipulated by this Court as per Annexure-Al order. However, the warrant will be kept in abeyance for a period of fifteen days from today, to enable the petitioner to pay the fine. maaan tart ws Bes. BRE Ha? 2018/KER/243 Cri. M.C.
