TO JUDGE R.AV Bevan 2017/KER/229 SUNIL THOMAS, J. ~CrLM.C.No.45 of 2017 Dated this the 4 day of January, 2017 ORDER The petitioner herein is the sole accused in Crime No.27/14 of Puthencruz Police Station for offences punishable under Sections 324 and 326 of the Indian Penal Code. After investigation final report was laid and the matter is pending as CC.No.1504/2014 of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kolencherry. 2. The petitioner submits that the warrant was issued by the court below at the first instance itself. According to the petitioner herein, he was employed and was regularly attending the office. He never absconded and he never had any intention to keep away from the jurisdiction of the court below. The petitioner now submits that he is ready and willing to appear before the court below and participate in the trial. However his only apprehension is that in the event of his surrender before Bevan 2017/KER/229 Crl.M.C.No.45 of 2017 2 the court below, the court below is not likely to take up his bail application on the same day and there is a possibility that he will be remanded. 3. Notice was given to the learned Public Prosecutor and heard the learned counsel for the petitioner. 4. The offences alleged against the petitioner are under Sections 324 and 326 of the Indian Penal Code. It seems that the final report was laid some time in 2014 and the matter has been pending since then. In the light of the submission of the petitioner that he is ready and willing to participate in the proceedings, virtually the purpose of issuing the summons stand served. Hence I feel that relief can be granted to the petitioner herein. Hence this Crl.M.C is disposed of with a direction that in the event of the petitioner herein appearing before the court below within ten days from today and submitting himself to the jurisdiction, his bail application may be considered by the court below on the same day, having regard to the above said facts. The warrant issued Pearl fap aeie as 2017/KER/229 Crl.M.C.No.45 of 2017 3 by the court below will be kept in abeyance during the above ten days period. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE R.AV"
