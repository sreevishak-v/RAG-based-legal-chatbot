ANNEXURE A2: AFFIDAVIT SWORN BY THE 2ND RESPONDENT. RESPONDENT(S)' EXHIBITS : NIL HTRUE COPY// P.S. TO JUDGE Mn ae 2015/KER/247 P.UBAID, J. \"Cri M.C.No. 7276 OF 2014 Dated this the 6\" day of January, 2015 ORDER The petitioners herein are the two accused in S.C. No. 394/2014 of the Court of Sessions, Ernakulam, now pending before the learned Principal Assistant Sessions Judge, Ernakulam. The incident of assault alleged in this case happened in connection with some dispute regarding the running time of two private buses. The Ernakulam Town North Police Registered the Crime under Sections 341 & 308 read with Section 34 of IPC on the complaint of one Shemim who sustained injuries in the alleged incident. He is the second respondent herein. The petitioners now seek orders quashing the prosecution on the ground that they and the said Shemim have come to terms amicably out of Court, and the whole dispute, which led to the unfortunate incident stands, resolved for ever. The de facto complainant Shemim has filed affidavit to the effect that the whole dispute stands resolved and he has ae 2015/KER/247 Crl.M.C. No.7276 of 2014 22: no complaint or grievance. On a perusal of the prosecution records including the wound certificate, I find that there is absolutely nothing to attract Section 308 of IPC and that the said section was incorporated on the basis of a purely hypothetical statement. Anyway, the parties have come to terms amicably and the de facto complainant has no grievance or complaint now. In such a situation, continuance of the prosecution will not serve any purpose other than wasting the precise time of the trial court, because there is no material to support the prosecution, if the case goes to trial. In the result, the Crl.M.C. is allowed. The prosecution against the petitioners in S.C. No.394/2014 of the Court of Sessions , Ernakulam, will stand quashed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Accordingly, the petitioners will stand released from the prosecution and the bail bond , if any, executed by them will stand discharged. Sd/- P.UBAID, Judge.
