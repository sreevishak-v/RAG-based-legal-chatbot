BY STATION HOUSE OFFICER, MUSEUM POLICE STATION, THIRUVANANTHAPURAM, REP. BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR, HIGH COURT OF KERALA, ERNAKULAM 682 031. BY ADV. SRI.VINOD KUMAR.C SMT REKHA C NAIR SR PP THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 09.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Bags ial Cr1.MC.No. 8736 of 2018 2 2011KER/1240 ORDER This petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (the Code for brevity) with a prayer to quash the proceedings pending against the petitioners. 2. The 2 respondent is the daughter of the 1 respondent. The 1* petitioner and the 2 respondent were in love. As their relationship was not approved by the 1* respondent, they eloped. The 1* respondent set the law in motion and based on his information, Crime No.661/2011 was registered on 21.07.2011. After completion of investigation, the final report has been laid before the Court of Session. The case is now pending as S.C. No.1157 of 2013 on the file of the II Additional Sessions Court, Thiruvananthapuram. 3. Before the submission of the final report, the family members got together and decided to solemnize the marriage between the lovers. Consequently, on 8.9.2012, the marriage was held as is evident from Annexure-C certificate. Two children were born to them and this fact is evident from Annexures-D and E birth certificates. The respondents i and 2 have filed separate affidavits before this Court stating that the entire disputes have resolved between the parties and they have no grievance. It is in the aforesaid backdrop that this Beer op Cr1.MC.No. 8736 of 2018 3 2011KER/1240 petition is filed seeking to quash the proceedings. 5. Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners, the party respondents and the learned Public Prosecutor. 6. It is submitted that the 1% petitioner and the 2 respondent having married, the continuance of proceedings is clear abuse of process. 7. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted that the statement of the party respondents have been recorded and the State has no objection in terminating the proceedings as it involves no public interest. 7. I have considered the submissions advanced. 8. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303] and in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466], the Apex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. 9. The offence committed by the petitioners cannot be said to be grave and serious having ingredients of extreme mental depravity. Bes Cr1.MC.No. 8736 of 2018 4 2011KER/1240 It also does not appear that the offence in this case will have a serious impact on the society. It is felt that quashing of proceedings on account of compromise would bring about peace and secure the ends of justice. Even otherwise, persisting with the prosecution would be nothing, but a waste of time as the prospects of conviction is bleak. Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I am of the considered view that this Court will be well justified in invoking its extraordinary powers under Section 482 of the Code to quash the proceedings. In the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-B Final Report and all proceedings pursuant thereto against the petitioners now pending as S.C.No.1157 of 2013 on the file of the II Additional Sessions Court, Thiruvananthapuram are quashed.
