BY ADV. SRI.P.I.GHORGEKUTTY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR SRI RAMESH CHAND THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 09.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Crl.MC.No. 8723 of 2018 2 201S1KER/T239 ORDER Petitioner was the first accused in C.C.No.84 of 2006 n the file of the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Kottayam. He along with the second accused was charged with having committed the offences under Section 420 IPC. On his failure to appear in the court proceedings under Sections 82 and 83 were initiated. Still he did not appear. His case was removed to the register of long pending cases, the number being L.P.No.7/2011. The co- accused was tried and acquitted. Tt is stated that the order removing the case of the petitioner to the register of long pending cases was illegal. It is further submitted that the matter has been settled between the petitioner and the second respondent who is the victim. The proceedings are sought to be quashed. 2. Heard the learned counsel for the Crl.MC.No. 8723 of 2018 3 2019/KER/1239 petitioner and the second respondent and the learned Public Prosecutor. 3. The proceedings against the petitioner under Sections 82 and 83 were simultaneously involved by the trial court. This court in Molly Vs. State [1994(1)KLJ 930] held that such a procedure is illegal. So the order of transferring the case to the register of long pending cases was illegal. 4. I have perused the Annexure A2 Judgment by which the co-accused was acquitted. The Second respondent has entered appearance through counsel. T am satisfied that the matter has been settled. The proceedings against the petitioner are liable to be quashed. In the result this Crl1.M.C. is allowed. The order by which the case of the petitioner was removed to the register of long pending cases is set aside. The proceedings against the Bape bel | oes aa Cr1.MC.No. 8723 of 2018 4 2019/KER/1239 petitioner in C.C.No.33 of 2010, which was refiled from C.C.No.84 of 2006 are quashed.
