Dated this the 11\" day of January, 2024 ORDER Petitioners are facing indictment for the offence under Sections 279, 341, 332, 356 and 294(b) read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, in C.C.No.262/2020 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Chavakkad, which arose from Crime No.660/2019 of Chavakkad Police Station. They challenge the final report filed in the above case. 2. According to the prosecution, the defacto complainant who is the driver of a KSRTC bus was wrongfully restrained and assaulted by the petitioners on 29.10.2019 and thereby committed the offences alleged. 3. Sri. A. G. Viswambharan, the learned counsel for the petitioners contended that the prosecution allegations do not make out any of the offences alleged and that the imputations against the petitioners are highly improbable. It is also alleged that the allegations are manifestly attended with malafides and therefore, the jurisdiction of this Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, can be invoked as held in the decision in State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal [1992 Supp (1) SCC 335]. Apart from the above, the learned counsel also asserted that the complaint was initiated by the defacto complainant only for the purpose of overcoming departmental action against him for his criminal Pee 2024/KER/2390 Crl.M.C.No.189 of 2024 4: behavior and the victims of the incident are being arrayed as accused. 4. Smt. Sreeja. V, the learned Public Prosecutor on the other hand submitted that the nature of allegations as revealed from Annexure-Al final report indicates that the same can be appreciated only after trial and that Section 482 of Cr.P.C. cannot be invoked. 5. The prosecution alleges that, on 29.10.2019, the accused, who were travelling in a car blocked the KSRTC bus driven by the defacto complainant for not having given way for the car. Thereafter the accused opened the divers door of the bus and assaulted the defacto complainant and attempted to pulled him down after abusing him and thereby committed the offences alleged. Though the learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently contended about the alleged falsity of the crime, | am of the view that, these are all matters for appreciation after due trial and the jurisdiction under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. cannot be availed to quash the proceedings. Further, if in case, the allegations raised against the petitioners are not made out from the materials collected by the investigation, petitioners will have to approach the _ jurisdictional Magistrate seeking discharge. The inherent powers of this Court under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. cannot be invoked in a case of this nature. Accordingly, | find no merit in the Criminal Miscellaneous Case and it is dismissed.
