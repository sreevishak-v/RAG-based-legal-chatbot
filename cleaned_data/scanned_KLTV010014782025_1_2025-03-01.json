No.623/2025 (Crime No. 56/2025 of Valiyathura Police Station pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-XI, Thiruvananthapuram) Petitioner/Accused:- Nishad Thaha @ Kappayi, aged 39 years, S/o Thaha, TC 78/4536, All Saints Mosque, Sangumugham, Kadakampally, Thiruvananthapuram. By Advocates. S P Santhosh and B Pradeep Kumar RESPONDENTS:- 1. State of Kerala. 2. Station House Officer, Valiyathura Police Station, Thiruvananthapuram. By Public Prosecutor Dr T Geena Kumary This Crl.M.C. came up for hearing on 28/02/2025 and the court on 01-03-2025 passed the following : ORDER This is an application filed by the sole accused in the above crime under Section 483 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking regular bail. 2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable under Sections 296(b), 115(2), 75(1)(i) and 78(1)(i) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. 3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- The defacto complainant is the owner of a hotel by name Niya Hotel and the victim is a Criminal M.C.No.623/2025 1/5 staff therein. On 03.01.2025 at about 4.15 p.m., while the victim was washing vessels in the back side of the hotel situated near All Saints Mosque Junction in Kadakampally Village, the accused came from behind and called her by touching her back and offered Rs.500/- to her for going with him, and when she refused, the accused caught hold of her hand and when she made noise, he closed her mouth and kicked on her stomach. When she fell down and again made noise, the accused closed her mouth, and when the defacto complainant intervened, the accused uttered abusive words against her and pulled her dress. After this incident also, the accused followed the victim and caused disturbances to her. A. Reportedly, the petitioner/accused was arrested on 08.02.2025 and he is in custody since then. 5. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The Investigating Officer filed report opposing the bail application. 6. Heard. Perused the records. 7. The only point to be considered is, whether regular bail can be granted to the petitioner/accused. 8. The Point:- The defacto complainant is the employer of the victim. The victim belongs to the State of Assam. The prosecution alleges that, the petitioner/accused touched the back of the victim while she was washing vessels, and offered money to her and demanded her to go with him, and when Criminal M.C.No.623/2025 2/5 she refused, he assaulted her, and when the defacto complainant intervened, the accused assaulted her also. 9. According to the petitioner, he is innocent of the allegations levelled against him and he has been falsely implicated in this case. It is submitted that, the actual fact is that, the petitioner had gone to the hotel run by the defacto complainant and ordered food, and since the food supplied to him has a foul smell, he informed the same to the staff and to the defacto complainant, and aggrieved by this, the defacto complainant created a false story and filed a complaint against him before the Valiyhathura Police Station. The petitioner submits that, the Police, after the preliminary enquiry, found that the complaint was false and baseless, and later, the defacto complainant filed a complaint before the Commissioner of Police, Thiruvananthapuram, and got registered the present case against the petitioner. 10. There is serious allegation as against the petitioner. However, it is seen from the report filed by the Investigating Officer that the statement of the defacto complainant and the victim under Section 183(6) of BNSS were recorded, the scene mahazar is prepared, and the treatment certificate is obtained. It appears that, the major part of the investigation is over. The petitioner/ accused is in judicial custody for a period of 21 days. So even if the petitioner is released on bail, there is nothing much, which will adversely affect the investigation. The petitioner/accused is involved in seven other crimes. Criminal M.C.No.623/2025 3/5 But, considering the period of detention already undergone by the petitioner and the stage of investigation, I am of the view that, the petitioner/accused can be enlarged on bail subject to conditions. In the result, the petition is allowed and the petitioner/ accused is granted bail on the following conditions:- (1) Petitioner/accused shall execute bail bond for Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) with two solvent sureties for the like sum each to the satisfaction of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-XI, Thiruvananthapuram. (2) Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer on every Monday between 10 a.m. and 12 noon for a period of 3 (three) months or till the final report is filed, whichever is earlier. (3) Petitioner shall not enter into the limits of the Police Station, where the victim resides/works, except for complying with the orders of this court, till the final report is filed. (4) Petitioner shall not commit any offence while on bail. (5) Petitioner shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade them from Criminal M.C.No.623/2025 4/5 disclosing such facts to the court or to any police officer or tamper with evidence. (6) Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer as and when required by the Investigating Officer. (7) Petitioner shall fully co-operate with the investigation. In case of any violation of the above conditions or misuse of liberty, the prosecution or the defacto complainant is at liberty to approach jurisdictional court for cancellation of bail.
