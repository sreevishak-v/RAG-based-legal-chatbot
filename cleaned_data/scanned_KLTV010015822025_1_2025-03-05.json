Geenakumary This petition came up for hearing on 04/03/2025 and the court on 05/03/2025 passed the following : ORDER This is an application filed by the 3 accused in the above crime under Section 483 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking regular bail. Criminal M.C.No.660/2025 1/5 2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable under Sections 189(2), 189(3), 189(4), 191(1), 191(8), 296(b), 126(2), 115(2), 118(1), 118(2), 109 and 351 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. 3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- On 20.07.2024 at about 5.30 p.m., the accused, eight in number, formed themselves into an unlawful assembly and accused Nos. 1 and 2 wrongfully restrained him, and went from there. Thereafter, at about 6.30 p.m., the 1* accused, by using an iron rod, beat the defacto complainant on his left knee, and the 2 accused hacked him on his head, using the chopper. Then, accused Nos. 3 and 4 fisted the defacto complainant on his face and forehead, using a sharp object, causing injuries, and the other four accused persons beat and fisted the defacto complainant, and the 3\" accused threatened him, and the 2\" accused poured arrack into the mouth and face of the defacto complainant. 4. Reportedly, the petitioner/ 3\" accused was arrested on 15.02.2025 and he is in custody since then. 5. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The Investigating Officer filed report opposing the bail application. Criminal M.C.No.660/2025 2/5 6. Heard. Perused the records. 7. The only point to be considered is, whether regular bail can be granted to the petitioner/ 3\" accused. 8. The Point:- The petitioner/ 3 accused along with other accused is alleged to have assaulted the defacto complainant. Allegedly, the 2\" accused, by using a chopper, and accused Nos. 3 and 4, by using a sharp weapon, attacked the defacto complainant, causing injuries. The motive of the alleged incident is the animosity against the defacto complainant as he pointed the house of the 1* accused to the police in connection with a theft case. 9. According to the petitioner, he is innocent of the allegations levelled against him, and there is delay in registering the First Information Report. It is submitted that, the defacto complainant, who is the brother-in-law of the accused, after consuming alcohol, fallen somewhere and caused injuries, and due to his personal animosity, the present case has been falsely foisted against the petitioner and three others. The petitioner submits that, his wife is a chronic cancer patient and there is no one to look after her. Criminal M.C.No.660/2025 3/5 10. The gravity of the offence alleged is grave. Allegedly, the petitioner / 3\" accused along with the other accused had assaulted the defacto complainant, causing severe injuries. The petitioner herein is alleged to have hit against the face and forehead of the defacto complainant, using a sharp weapon. It is reported that the iron rod and chopper used for the commission of the offence were recovered. The wound certificate and treatment summary of the defacto complainant produced along with the report shows that, he had sustained severe injuries, including traumatic brain injury and soft tissue contusions. He was treated at Community Health Centre, Vellanadu and S.K.Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram. So the prosecution has made out a prima face case against the petitioner/ 3 accused and regarding the involvement of the petitioner in the alleged offence. It is stated in the report that the 4\" accused is yet to be arrested and four other accused persons arrayed as accused Nos. 5 to 8 are to be identified. The investigation is progressing. The petitioner / 3 accused is in judicial custody only for a period of 18 days. If the petitioner / 3\" accused is released on bail, he is likely to influence or intimidate the defacto complainant and other witnesses, and tamper with the evidence. So, the investigation will be adversely affected. The chance of absconding also cannot be ruled out. Considering all these aspects, Criminal M.C.No.660/2025 4/5 including the gravity of the offence, this court is not inclined to release the petitioner on bail at this stage. In the result, this petition is dismissed. Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and pronounced by me in Open Court on this the 5\" day of March, 2025.
