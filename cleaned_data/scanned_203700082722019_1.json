RAMESH CHAND, P.P THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 07.01.2020, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: 2020/KER/502 Crl.MC.No.8272 OF 2019(D) 2 ORDER Dated this the 7th day of January 2020 The petitioners have been directed to show cause why they should not execute a bond under Section 107 of the Cr.P.C as per impugned order at Annexure-I. 2. The order indicates that, on a report filed by the Sub Inspector of Police consequent to registering an FIR as Crime No.232/19 under Section 107 of the Cr.P.C, the Sub Divisional Magistrate was convinced that the petitioners are liable to answer for breach of peace because earlier, another Crime No.79/2019 has been registered against them. Accordingly the impugned order was issued. It is pertinent to note that even though Annexure Al indicate that it was a preliminary order it is not an order under Section 111. Even though, towards the end of the order, the Sub Divisional Magistrate 2020/KER/502 Crl.MC.No.8272 OF 2019(D) 3 states that the petitioners shall show cause why they should not be ordered under Section 107 of the Cr.P.C r/w Section 111 of the said code to execute a bond for Rs.25,000/- with two solvent sureties for a like amount to keep peace for a period of one year, no. such combined order can be passed by the Sub Divisional Magistrate as it is held by this Court in Santhosh v. State of Kerala, 2014 (3) KLT 837 and also subsequent decision in Sajeesh.K v. State of Kerala, 2014 SCC Online Ker.27899. By initiating proceedings under Section 107 of the Cr.P.C, the Magistrate must pass an order under Section 111 of the Cr.P.C, stating the nature of information proceedings and the relevant factors which influence the mind in Magistrate to form an opinion that the petitioners are likely to cause imminent breach of peace or public tranquility in a particular 2020/KER/502 Crl.MC.No.8272 OF 2019(D) 4 case and the probable period during which it is likely to disturb the peace of tranquility ina particular locality, and in order to prevent the same it is necessary to take preventive actions against them. 3. In the instant case apart from the FIR which was registered by the Sub Inspector which itself appears to be not proper because Section 107 of the Cr.P.C is not a cognizable offence for which an FIR can be registered. It should actually has been a report filed by the Sub Inspector of Police requesting action to be taken under Section 107 of the Cr.P.C. 4. In view of the settled position that proceedings under Section 111 has to be initiated prior to making an order under Section 107 and therefore, the entire proceedings in Annexure-I as M.C No.217/2019, Real Elz ro a 2020/KER/502 Crl.MC.No.8272 OF 2019(D) 5 against the petitioners shall stands quashed. However, it is made clear that there is no embargo in the Sub Divisional Magistrate proceeding afresh on a report properly received in accordance with law.
