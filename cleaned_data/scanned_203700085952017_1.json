RESPONDENT(S) EXHIBITS NIL R.AV ITTRUE COPY// PA TO JUDGE eee) SUNIL THOMAS, J ee Cri.M.C.No.8595 of 2017 Dated this the 3\" day of January, 2018 ORDER The petitioners herein stand arrayed as the accused in Crime No. 528/2016 of the Irinjalakuda Police Station now pending as CP.No.CP.No.69/2016 of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Irinjalakuda for offences punishable under section 395 of the Indian Penal Code. 2. The prosecution allegation is that on 11.3.2016 at 12.13 noon, the petitioners herein trespassed into the shop run by the third respondent, and standing in the name of his wife, by showing a weapon threatened the second respondent, who was the employee, and had stolen three mobile phones and Rs.20,000/- kept in the drawer. Pursuant to the crime registered, investigation was conducted and final report was laid. The matter is now pending before the court. 3. The petitioners contending that the dispute was a purely personal dispute between the parties and though it has been given a serious colour to make it a grave eee) Bsa Cri.M.C.No.8595 of 2017 2U1SIRERIS 2 offence, the matter has now been settled between the parties, has approached this court. It was contended by the learned counsel for the petitioners that the disputes were settled between the parties evidenced by Annexure- A3 and 4 affidavits, affirmed by the second and third respondents. The learned counsel for the second and third respondents acknowledged the due execution of the above affidavits in acceptance of the settlement between the parties. The learned Public Prosecutor also submitted that the disputes have been resolved and that the petitioners herein have no criminal antecedents. It was submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioners that even though there was an allegation that they had committed dacoity by show of force, the investigation did not reveal any serious offence. It was pointed out by the learned counsel for the petitioners that though there was an allegation that a weapon was used to threaten the defacto complainant, in fact the weapon was_ not recovered. Hence the ingredients of the offence to that extent will not lie. It was further contended by the eee) Bsa Cri.M.C.No.8595 of 2017 2U1SIRERIS learned counsel that the amount allegedly taken from the drawer had also not been recovered. Hence there is no material to substantiate that part of the allegation. Hence it was contended by the learned counsel for the petitioners that at the most the allegation may confine to stealing of two mobile phones. It was submitted by the learned counsel that it was only a dispute between the parties relating to the purchase of mobile phones. Considering the above facts and also the fact that the petitioners are not involved in any other case and in the light of the settlement reported by the parties, I feel that no purpose will be served by prosecuting the petitioners herein. Accordingly, a quietus is liable to be given to the entire prosecution. 5. Hence the Crl.M.C is allowed quashing all further proceedings in CP.NO.69/2016 on the files of the Judicial First Class magistrate Court-I, Irinjalakuda arising from Crime No.528/2016 of Irinjalakuda Police Station.
