The Prosecution allegations in brief are as follows: Due to animosity towards the Informant, the Accused persons in furtherance of their common intention, on 23.06.2017 at 5.30 PM at Chavadimukku, Sreekaryam ward, uttered obscene words to him and punched on his right cheek causing abrasion below his eyes and further slapped and punched him on various part of his body. Thus, the Accused persons are alleged to have committed the above offences. 3. The cognizance was taken on the basis of Final Report in respect of the offences under Sections 294(b), 323 r/w 34 of the IPC. On issuance of process, the Accused persons entered appearance. They were enlarged on bail. They were represented by a Counsel of their own choice. Copies of all relevant Prosecution records were furnished to them. Particulars of offences under Sections 294(b), 323 r/w 34 of the IPC were read over and explained to them, to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. 3 4. From the side of Prosecution CW1 was examined as PW1. Exhibit P1 was marked. The Learned Assistant Public Prosecutor gave up the remaining witnesses as the Injured himself had turned hostile to the Prosecution and Prosecution evidence was closed. Since no incriminating circumstances arose against the Accused persons from the deposition of the witness, their examination under Section 313 (1)(b) of the CrPC was dispensed with. No evidence was adduced from the side of the Defence. 5. Heard both sides and perused the documents. The following points arise for consideration. (a) Have the Accused Persons in furtherance of their common intention uttered obscene words against PW1 and thereby committed the offence punishable under section 294(b) r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged (b) Have the Accused Persons in furtherance of their common intention voluntarily caused hurt to PW1 and thereby committed the offence punishable under section 323 r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged (c) If so, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded? 6. Points (a) and (b): These points are considered together for the sake of brevity and for avoiding repetition. PW1 deposed that he resides near Sreekaryam and he is a plumber. He doesnt remember the exact date of the incident and that the same was in the year 2018. The incident occurred by around 3.00 pm near Chavadimukku. He further deposed that he had given Exhibit Pl statement to the police regarding the incident. There occurred some exachange of words between him and other two persons. They uttered obscene words against him. He doesnt remember whether he went for treatment or otherwise. He would not be able to identify the persons who had allegedly assaulted him. When leading question was put forth by the Learned APP under Section 154 of Indian Evidence Act read with Section 162 of 4 the CrPC, he admitted that matter has been settled between the parties and there is a case pending before this Court in which he is arrayed as the Accused and in both these cases matter has been settled between the parties and Compounding Petition filed. I have carefully considered the evidence adduced by the Prosecution and the materials on record. It is pertinent to note that PW1, the injured himself is having no complaint or allegations that the Accused persons have assaulted him or uttered obscene words against him. The remaining witnesses were given up by the Prosecution as no purpose would be served in examining the remaining witness, when the Injured herself has no case supporting the Prosecution. On perusal of the evidence led by the Prosecution and the materials on record, it is clear from the testimony of PW1 that there is no evidence to support the Prosecution case. None of the ingredients of the alleged offences are made out from the evidence led. There is nothing available on record to implicate the Accused persons to the above incident. Further, the parties have already settled the matter and filed a Compounding Petition, which however was rejected since the offences alleged involved non-compoundable offence. Hence, on a total consideration of facts and circumstances of the above case and on appreciation of the evidence adduced, this Court finds that the Prosecution has failed to prove the case against the Accused persons and therefore, Points (a) and (b) are found in favour of the Accused persons. 7. In the result, the 1% and 2\"? Accused are found not guilty of having committed the offences punishable under Sections 294(b), 323 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. They are acquitted of the aforesaid offences under Section 255(1) of the CrPC. Their bail bonds stand cancelled and they are set at liberty.
