No.627/2025 (Crime No.150/2025 of Aruvikkara Police Station) Petitioner/Accused No.7:- Rajani.A Prabha, aged 45 years, W/o Gireesh P.P, residing at Giri Vikas, Nagacheri, Anad P.O, Anad, Thiruvananthapuram -695541 By Advocate:-Kuttiyani Sudheer Respondent:- 1. The Station House Officer, Aruvikkara Police Station 2. State of Kerala By Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumary This petition came up for hearing on 03/03/2025 and the court on 04/03/2025 passed the following : ORDER This is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail. 2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable under Sections 409 and 420, r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, and Crime Criminal M.C.No.627/2025 1/5 No. 150/2025 of Aruvikkara Police Station is registered against the petitioner/ 7\" accused. 3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- The accused Nos. 1 to 7, who were the staff of Rajiv Gandhi Residents Welfare Co-operative Society situated in Nedumangadu Taluk, along with accused Nos. 8 to 16, in furtherance of their common intention to obtain wrongful gain and to cause wrongful loss to the depositors in the Society, during the period from 01.04.2021 to 31.05.2024, committed misappropriation in the deposits, and obtained a total sum of Rs.24,74,21,480/- from them. 4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The Investigating Officer filed report opposing the anticipatory bail application. 5. Heard. Perused the records. 6. The only point to be considered is, whether an order of anticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioner/ 7\" accused. 7. The Point:- The petitioner / 7 accused was an employee of Rajiv Gandhi Residents Welfare Co-operative Society, Mundela. The defacto complainant was the Part-Time Administrator of Rajiv Gandhi Residents Welfare Co-operative Society. The prosecution allegation is that, the accused persons have Criminal M.C.No.627/2025 2/5 committed misappropriation of around Rs.24,74,21,480/- by taking loan in benami names and by way of advance MDS. The specific allegation against petitioner / 7\" accused is that, she had pledged the property in her name as security for obtaining different loans and MDS. 8. The petitioner submits that, she is working as a temporary attender in the Rajiv Gandhi Residents Welfare Co-operative Society. It is also submitted that, the 1* accused M.Mohankumar, who was the President of the said Society, committed suicide, after being falsely accused of misappropriating funds from the said Society. It is also submitted that, as a temporary attender, the petitioner cannot canvass and receive any money from the depositors and she is not a signatory authority in the institution and she has not attained any illegal gain or has not committed any misappropriation of money. She also submitted that, in the F.1.S. and in the F.LR., there is no specific allegation against the petitioner / 7\" accused. 9. The allegation against the petitioner is not grave. It is seen from the report filed by the Investigating Officer that, when a search was conducted in the Rajiv Gandhi Residents Welfare Co-operative Society, it was found that, using the same property and sureties, the petitioner had availed various loans and chitties and obtained more than Rs.50 Lakhs in the names of the husband, mother and Criminal M.C.No.627/2025 3/5 other relatives of the petitioner/7 accused. Even if some documents were found in the name of the relatives of the petitioner, the relevance of the same in the implication of the crime and the dishonest intention of the petitioner is a matter of evidence. The exact role of the petitioner is not brought out by the prosecution. It appears that there is no prima facie case against the petitioner. It would be a travesty of justice, if the petitioner is put behind the bars, if she has not committed any offence. No criminal antecedents of the petitioner is brought to the notice of this court. 10. In view of my discussion above, it appears that there is no impediment in granting a pre-arrest bail to the petitioner. Considering all these aspects, it is found that this is a fit case where a pre-arrest bail can be granted to the petitioner. In the result, the petition is allowed on the following conditions:- (1) In the event of arrest, the petitioner/ 7\" accused shall be released on bail on her executing bond for Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) with two solvent sureties for the like sum each to the satisfaction of the arresting officer/Investigating Officer, as the case may be. (2) Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. on every Thursday for a period Criminal M.C.No.627/2025 4/5 of 3 (three) months or till the filing of the final report, whichever is earlier. (3) Petitioner shall also appear before the Investigating Officer as and when required. (4) Petitioner shall not commit any offence while on bail. (5) Petitioner shall not attempt to contact the defacto complainant or any of the prosecution witnesses, directly or through any other person, or in any other way try to tamper with the evidence or influence any witnesses or other persons related to the investigation. In case of any violation of the above conditions or misuse of liberty, the prosecution or the defacto complainant is at liberty to approach jurisdictional court for cancellation of bail.
