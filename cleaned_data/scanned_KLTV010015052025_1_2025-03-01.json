Thampi.) Counter Petitioner/ Respondent:- State of Kerala represented by Station House Officer, Varkala Police Station. (By Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumari) This Crl.M.C. came up for hearing on 28/2/2025 and the court on the 1/3/2025 passed the following : ORDER This is an application filed by the 5\" accused in the above crime under Section 483 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking regular bail. 2. The petitioner/ 5\" accused is alleged to have committed the offences punishable under Sections 189(2), 191(2), 191(3), 126(2), 296(b), 118(1), 249(a) and 103, r/w Section 190 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. Criminal M.C.No.636/2025 1/5 3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- Accused Nos.1 to 4 were in inimical terms, with the uncle of the defacto complainant, Sri.Shajahan, and his brother-in-law Sri.Rahman. On 24.12.2024 at about 10.30 p.m., accused Nos.1 to 5 formed themselves into an unlawful assembly armed with deadly weapons and in prosecution of their common object, wrongfully restrained Shajahan and Rahman, while they were traveling in a Scooter bearing Registration No. KL-81-A-4115 near the Mosque at Vettoor Desom in Vettoor Village. Thereafter, accused No.1 uttered abusive words against Shajahan and Rahman, and fisted on the face of Rahman, using a steel chain. When Rahman evaded the attack, the same fell upon the face of Shajahan and he fell down from the vehicle. Then, accused Nos. 2 and 3, by using G.I. pipes, beat Rahman on his left middle finger and left hand muscle, causing injuries. When Shajahan attempted to escape from the scene, accused Nos. 1 and 3 beat him, towards his head, using the G.I. pipes causing grievous injury on his head, and the 4\" accused beat Shajahan on his back and left leg repeatedly using the blunt portion of a sword and hacked towards his head, using the sword, again causing grievous injury to Shajahan on his head. Then, accused Nos.2 and 5, by using G.I.Pipe and iron rod, beat Shajahan on his back and both hand muscles. When the defacto complainant and the local people rushed to the spot, the accused left the place. Thereafter, Criminal M.C.No.636/2025 2/5 Shajahan was taken to Taluk Hospital, Varkala, and from there to the KIMS Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram for treatment. But, due to the fatal injury sustained, Shajahan died at around 11.30 p.m. It is alleged that, after the incident, accused Nos. 1 to 4 left the place of occurrence in a Scooter bearing Registration No. KL-81-8468, and another Scooter bearing Reg. No. KL-81- 8569 owned and ridden by the 6\" accused and went to the house of the 7\" accused. Accused Nos.6 and 7 screened accused Nos. 1 to 4 from legal punishment, knowing that, they have committed the alleged offences. 4. Reportedly, the petitioner 5 accused was arrested on 25.12.2024 and he is in custody since then. 5. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The Investigating Officer filed report opposing the bail application. 6. Heard. Perused the records. 7. The only point to be considered is, whether regular bail can be granted to the petitioner/ 5\" accused. 8. The Point:- The petitioner / 5\" accused along with accused Nos. 1 to 4 is alleged to have brutally attacked one Shajahan and Rahman, using dangerous weapons, and murdered Shajahan. The allegation against the petitioner/5\" accused is that, he had along with the 2 accused, by using G.I.Pipe and Iron rod, beaten Shajahan on his back and both hand muscles, Criminal M.C.No.636/2025 3/5 and actively participated in the commission of the offence. The motive for the alleged incident is the enmity that aroused when Shajahan (the deceased), Shibu and Rahman, the uncles of the defacto complainant, warned the accused persons as against their usage of drugs in the premises of Thykkavu Mosque. 9. According to the petitioner, he is innocent and he has not committed any offence as alleged by the prosecution. It is also submitted that, the injury, which caused the death of the deceased was not due to the alleged overt act by the petitioner. 10. The magnitude of the offence alleged is grave. Allegedly, the petitioner/ 5\" accused had actively participated along with the other accused in the commission of murder. It is seen from the report filed by the Investigating Officer that the specific overt act alleged against the petitioner is that, he along with the 2 accused had beaten on the back and hand muscles of Shajahan (the deceased) by using a G.I.Pipe and iron rod. It is seen from the post-mortem certificate appended with the report that there are 15 ante-mortem injuries are noted. The First Information Statement was given by the close relative of the deceased. It is stated in the First Information Statement that one of the relatives of the deceased had seen the accused persons committing the offence and he identified the petitioner / Criminal M.C.No.636/2025 4/5 5\" accused. It is seen from the report filed by the Investigating Officer that the weapons, mobile phone, vehicles involved in the crime, and the dressses worn by the accused persons were recovered. So, the prosecution has made out a prima facie case against the petitioner / 5\" accused and regarding the involvement of the petitioner/ 5\" accused in the alleged offence. The petitioner/ 5\" accused is in judicial custody only for a period of 66 days. It is stated in the report that the investigation is progressing and accused Nos. 6 and 7 are yet to be arrested. If the petitioner/ 5\" accused is released on bail at this stage, he is likely to influence or intimidate the defacto complainant and other witnesses and tamper with the evidence. So, the investigation will be adversely affected. The chance of absconding also cannot be ruled out. Considering the gravity of the offence and the stage of investigation, this court is not inclined to release the petitioner on bail at this stage. In the result, this petition is dismissed.
