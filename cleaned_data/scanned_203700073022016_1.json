ANNEXURE A3 CERTIFIED COPY OF THE JUDGMENT DATED 24.06.2015 OF THE ADDITIONAL SESSIONS COURT IV, KOTTAYAM. RESPONDENTS' BXHIBITS : NIL /TRUE COPY/ P. A. TO JUDGE Pn Bas] 2017/KER/1238 SUNIL THOMAS, J. Dated this the 10\" day of January, 2017 ORDER The petitioner is the sole accused in S.C. No.206/2016 of Additional Sessions Court IV, Kottayam in Crime No.186/2012 of Kottayam West Police Station for offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 324, 326 & 307 read with 149 IPC. He stood charge sheeted along with the other accused in the above crime. The petitioner herein was not available for trial. By Annexure A3 judgment in SC No.219/2013 all other accused except the petitioner and another accused, who was arrayed as A5 and A6 were acquitted. The petitioner claims that he was in Gulf country and was not aware of the proceedings, has approached this Court seeking to quash the proceedings on the ground that the entire substratum of the case is lost and that he is entitled to the same benefit. Records reveal that by Annexure A3 judgment, other accused were acquitted holding that there was absolutely no evidence to connect them with the incident. 2. The learned Public Prosecutor on_ instructions submitted that the petitioner herein is not involved in any other seen 4 arn 2017/KER/1238 Cri. M. C. No. 7302 of 2016 2 case and that Annexure A3 judgment is not challenged in any other proceedings. Evidently, it has become final. 3. Having regard to these facts, | feel that the petitioner herein is also entitled for the relief since the substratum of the entire prosecution case is lost by Annexure A3 judgment. Hence, | am inclined to allow the Crl.M.C, as against the petitioner herein in S.C. No.206/2016 of Additional Sessions Court - IV, Kottayam, now pending trial. Hence, Crl.M.C. is allowed as above.
