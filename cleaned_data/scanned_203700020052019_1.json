OTHER PRESENT: C.S.HRITHWIK-SR.P.P THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 06.01.2020, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: bieeen Crl.MC.No.2005 OF 2019(A) 2 2020/KER/I6 ORDER Dated this the 6th day of January 2020 Petitioners are accused 1 and 2 in Crime No.1460/2012 of Kodungallur Police Station. There were three accused in the crime and the petitioners were absconding and the trial proceeded against the 3rd accused as S.T. No.2522/2012 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kodungallur. The 3 accused who faced trial was found not guilty and acquitted by the Jurisdictional Magistrate under Section 255(1) of Cr.P.C, vide judgment at Annexure Al dated 8.12.2017. On appreciation of evidence let in by Pws1 and 2, it was found that it was not reliable and there were certain discrepancies which led to the acquittal of the 3 accused. Since accused 1 and 2 were absconding and the case against them was split up and refiled and presently pending as S.T No.3076/2017 on the files of the same court. The petitioner contends that in view of the acquittal of the 3% accused, they are also entitled to similar consideration and hence the case against them may be quashed under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. oR Crl.MC.No.2005 OF 2019(A) 3 2020/KER/I6 2. A reading of Annexure Al judgment indicates that it was on appreciation of evidence let in by witnesses that the court below found it difficult to convict the 3 accused. On the basis of the appreciation of evidence, it is not possible to quash the proceedings under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. The petitioner will have to face the trial and the extra ordinary power under Section 482 of CrP.C cannot be exercised in favour of the petitioners to quash the proceedings in the crime. The Crl.M.C. is therefore dismissed.
