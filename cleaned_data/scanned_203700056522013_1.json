Crl.M.C.No.5652 of 2013 Dated this the 3\" day of January, 2017 ORDER Petitioners are arrayed as accused Nos.1 and 2 in Crime No.1217 of 2013 of Kothamangalam Police Station for offences punishable under sections 7 and 8 of the Kerala Gaming Act, 1960. 2. The allegation of the prosecution is that, on getting a secret information that activities prohibited under the Gaming Act were being carried out in the house of the first accused, police conducted a search and recovered a sum of Rs.64,200/- and a car. Contending that the first accused is a totally handicapped person, bedridden and that, recovery was effected from the house of the first accused, further that the first and second accused are close friends, and also that the source of money which was recovered from them can be proved by bank records, petitioners have approached this Court. 3. It was contended by the learned counsel for the petitioners, relying on the decision reported in Sunil & Others v. State of Kerala & Another (2014(1) KHC 469), that the Act Ereee 2017/KER/53 Crl.M.C.5652/13 2 will apply only in case it is conducted in a common gaming place. Any place can be a common gaming place, if it is thrown open to or accessible to others. Learned Public Prosecutor submitted that secret information was received and the second petitioner is an outsider. After investigation, final report has been laid and the matter is pending as S.T.No.3816 of 2013 as submitted by the learned Public Prosecutor. Essentially, these are questions of fact to be appreciated and established by the prosecution in evidence. Hence, I am not inclined to invoke section 482 Cr.P.C at this stage. Crl.M.C fails and is dismissed. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS Judge Sbna/ True Copy / P A to Judge"
