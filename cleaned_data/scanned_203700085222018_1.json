CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 07.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: gree Crl.MC.No. 8522 of 2018 2 20191KERI6S? ORDER This petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (the Code for brevity) with a prayer to quash the proceedings pending against the petitioner. 2. The 2\" respondent is the wife of the petitioner. Their marriage was solemnized on 09.11.2014 and they were living together. In the course of their connubial relationship, serious disputes cropped up. The 2 respondent specifically alleges that the petitioner is guilty of culpable matrimonial cruelty. This finally led to the institution of criminal proceedings at the instance of the 2\"? respondent. FIR was registered and after investigation, final report was laid before the learned Magistrate and the case is now pending as C.C.No.1830 of 2017 on the files of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class-I, Tirur. In the aforesaid case, the petitioner is accused of having committed offences punishable under Sections 498A and 406 read with Section 34 of the IPC. 3. The learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner BRE oa Crl.MC.No. 8522 of 2018 3 2011KEROS7 submitted that at the instance of well wishers and family members, the parties have decided to put an end to their discord and have decided to part ways. It is urged that the dispute is purely private in nature. The learned counsel appearing for the 2\" respondent invited the attention of this Court to the affidavit filed by her and asserts that the disputes inter se have been settled and the continuance of criminal proceedings will only result in gross inconvenience and hardship. It is submitted that the 2\" respondent has no objection in allowing the prayer sought for. 4. The learned Public Prosecutor after getting instructions has submitted that the statement of the 2\" respondent has been recorded and she has stated in unequivocal terms that the settlement arrived at is genuine. 5. Ihave considered the submissions advanced. 6. In Gian singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303] and in Narinder singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466], the Apex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the Beer Crl.MC.No. 8522 of 2018 4 2019/KERIOS7 High Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. Further in Jitendra Raghuvanshi & Others v. Babita Raghuvanshi & Another (2013) 4 SCC 58, it was observed that it is the duty of the courts to encourage genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes. If the parties ponder over their faults and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual agreement instead of fighting it out in a court of law, the courts should not hesitate to exercise its powers under Section 482 of the Code. Permitting such proceedings to continue would be nothing, but an abuse of process of court. The interest of justice also require that the proceedings be quashed. 7. Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I am of the considered view that this Court will be well justified in invoking its extraordinary powers under Section 482 of the Code to quash the proceedings. In the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-A2 final report and all proceedings pursuant thereto BRE ES eee Bis aaerts Crl.MC.No. 8522 of 2018 5 2019/KERIOS7 against the petitioner now pending as C.C.No.1830 of 2017 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Tirur are quashed.
