CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 08-01- 2018,THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: vgd | 2018/KER/725 SUNIL THOMAS, J. Dated this the 8 day of January, 2018 ORDER The petitioner herein stands arrayed as the 2 accused in S.C. No.760/2017 of Additional District Court 1, Thalassery arising from Crime No.1764/2016 of Mattannore Police Station for offences punishable under Sections 7 read with Section 8 of the POCSO Act. According to the petitioner, pursuant to the final report filed, cognizance was taken and summons was issued to him. Since he was away in connection with his employment, he could not appear before the court below. 2. The petitioner submits that he is ready and willing to appear before the court below, submit himself to the jurisdiction and to participate in all future proceedings personally or through his counsel. However, his apprehension is that since warrant has been issued, the court below is not likely to take up the applications to recall warrant and for bail on the same day of his appearance and he is likely to be remanded. 3. Having considered the limited prayer sought by the petitioner herein, notwithstanding the fact that he is involved in two other cases of similar nature, still, to meet the ends of justice ap 2018/KER/725 Cri. M. C. No. 8534 of 2017 2 and to facilitate an early conclusion of the trial, | am inclined to permit the petitioner to surrender before the court below within 10 days from today. If he surrenders within 10 days from today and files applications for bail and to recall warrant, the same shall be considered by the court below on the same day itself. The warrant, if any, issued from the court below will be kept in abeyance till his actual date of appearance within the above 10 days. Crl.M.C. is disposed of accordingly.
