Bee 2018/KER/492 B. KEMAL PASHA, J. Dated this the 5\" day of January, 2018 ORDER Petitioner is the accused in Crime No.345/2016 of the Vellamunda Police Station, Wayanad District, for the offences under Sections 511 of 384 IPC. 2. The allegation against the petitioners is that he appeared at the bakery conducted by the defacto complainant and demanded an amount of Rs.2,000/- by threatening the defacto complainant that licence from the Department of Factories and Boilers is required and if it is not taken, he would impose a fine of Rs.1 Lakh. 3. At any stretch of imagination the offence of extortion as defined under Section 384 IPC cannot be attracted. At the most, it is an attempt to commit misconduct within the meaning of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Therefore, an offence under Section 511 of Section 384 IPC is not legally sustainable in this case. Matters being so, Annexure-II FIR and all further proceedings based on it as against the petitioner is liable to be quashed. BLS # E wares apa 2018/KER/492 Cri.M.C.No.5322 of 2016 2 In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-II FIR and all further proceedings based on it as against the petitioner is hereby quashed.
