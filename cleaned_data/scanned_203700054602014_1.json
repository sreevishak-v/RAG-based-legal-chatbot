ANNEXURE C- ORIGINAL NOTARIZED AFFIDAVIT DATED 2.9.2014 SWORN TO BY THE 1ST RESPONDENT. RESPONDENTS EXHIBITS NIL ff TRUE COPY // P.A. TO JUDGE SD Biehl 2015/KER/1269 P. UBAID, J. Dated this the 12 day of January, 2015 ORDER The petitioners herein are the two accused _ in C.C.No.1903/2009 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Kollam. The 1* respondent herein is the defacto complainant in the said crime, on whose complaint the police registered the crime under Sections143, 147, 148, 427, 323 and Section 149 IPC, and Section 27 of the Arms Act. The petitioners now seek orders quashing the prosecution, on the ground that they and the defacto complainant have come to terms amicably out of court. The complaint was in fact made against two named persons, and some other identifiable persons. In spite of efforts made during investigation, the police could not identify and detect those persons, and so submitted final report against these two accused. The defacto complainant has filed affidavit before this Court that the whole dispute between him and the accused stands resolved forever, and that he has no grievance or complaint now. Though there is an allegation under the Arms Act, the Biehl 2015/KER/1269 Cri M.C.. No. 5460/2014 2 sustainability of such prosecution is really doubtful. Any way, the parties have come to terms amicably, and the defacto complainant now does not want to continue the prosecution. IT am well satisfied that there is a real and genuine settlement between the parties, and in such a situation, continuance of prosecution will not serve any purpose, other than wasting the precious time of the court. Nobody will support the prosecution, if the case goes to trial. In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed. The prosecution against the petitioners in C.C.No.1903/2009 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Kollam will stand quashed under Section 482 Cr.P.C. Accordingly, the petitioners will stand released from prosecution. The bail bond, if any, executed by them will stand discharged. Sd/- P. UBAID, JUDGE sd"
