KEMAL PASHA, J. ee ee ne \"Dated this the 9 day of January, 2018 ORDER The petitioner is the accused in C.C.No.974/2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-l, Thiruvananthapuram, which has arisen from Annexure-ll final report in Crime No.768/2014 of the Karamana Police Station, Thiruvananthapuram, for the offence punishable under Section 117(e) of the Kerala Police Act. It is alleged that the petitioner had obstructed the removal of an aged woman, who was abandoned on the road, to the police station for taking her to some old age home. 2. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that on information that the aged woman was abandoned by somebody on the road, the police reached there and they 2018/KER/985 CRL.M.C.No. 5516 of 2014 aoe wanted to somehow wash their hands and to send the aged woman to the premises of the Attukal Bagavathi Temple. The petitioner questioned the same and called media persons thereby the police was constrained to remove the aged woman to an old age home. 3. On a perusal of the report appended with Annexure 1 FIR it seems that an offence under Section 117(e) of the Kerala Police Act had not taken place. Apart from questioning the attempt of the police to send the aged woman to some other place in order to wash their hands, nothing had happened. The police got irritated when media persons appeared at the spot. The prosecution of the petitioner in this matter is quite unnecessary and therefore, Annexure II final report and all further proceedings pursuant to it in C.C.No.974/2014 pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-l, Thiruvananthapuram in Crime No.768/2014 of the Karamana_ Police Station, Thiruvananthapuram, are liable to be quashed. 2018/KER/985 CRL.M.C.No. 5516 of 2014 -30- In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure II final report and all further proceedings pursuant to it in C.C.No.974/2014 pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-l, Thiruvananthapuram in Crime No.768/2014 of the Karamana_ Police Station, Thiruvananthapuram, are hereby quashed.
