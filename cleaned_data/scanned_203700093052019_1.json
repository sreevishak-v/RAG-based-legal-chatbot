CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 06.01.2020, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: os 2020/KER/275 Crl1.MC 9305/2019 -2- ORDER Dated this the 6th day of January 2020 Petitioner is the fifth accused in Sc No.739/2014 on the files of the Assistant Sessions Court, Thrissur for having allegedly committed offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 324, 506Ci) and 307 read with Section 149 IPc. The case against the petitioner was split up and re-filed from the parent case, SC No.60/2002. The petitioner had earlier appeared and charge was framed against him. But not being aware of that, the learned Assistant Sessions Judge directed him to appear again for framing of charge on 20.8.2019, on which date, he was absent and his application for exemption from personal appearance was rejected. The bail granted to him was cancelled and NBW was issued on 14.11.2019. The petitioner was reported to be abroad, consequent to which it was directed to take steps under re 2020/KER/275 Crl1.MC 9305/2019 3. Sections 82 and 83 cr.PC. 2. Report was called for from the Principal Assistant Sessions Judge and in the report, it is stated that inadvertently without noticing that charge was framed, the case was again posted for framing of charge. The petitioner is willing to proceed with the trial of the case. His plea has already been recorded and therefore there was no embargo in his appearing through counsel to proceed with the trial. The case is not posted for trial and witnesses have not been summoned. Despite that, his bail was canceled, which apparently is a mistake on the part of the learned Assistant Sessions Judge. 3. In the result, the orders of the learned Assistant Sessions Judge directing cancellation of the bail and issuance of NBW and to take steps under Sections 82 and 83 Cr.PC on 20.8.2019 and 14.11.2019 shall stand quashed under Section 482 cCr.PC. The petitioner shall continue in bail on the very same bond and shall Bh Ble ie 2020/KER/275 Cr1.MC 9305/2019 -4- appear before the court for trial as and when called for. The Criminal M.c. is allowed as above.
