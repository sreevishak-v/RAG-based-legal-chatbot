Dated this the 11\" day of January, 2017 ORDER The petitioners herein are the accused in Crime No.620/2012 of Nadapuram Police Station for offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 323, 324, 294(b) read with 149 of IPC. It was alleged by the prosecution that, on 22.12.2012 at about 11.00 p.m., while the defacto complainant along with his friend were proceeding along the road, the accused intercepted and attacked them using soda bottles and sticks. Complaint was laid and on the basis of it crime was registered and investigation was conducted. The matter was taken cognizance and is pending. 2. The petitioners have approached this Court contending that the disputes between the parties have been resolved and that the allegation against the petitioners herein have been sorted out. Learned counsel for the 2 respondent, the defacto complainant invited my attention to Annexure 3 affidavit filed by him wherein he has stated that the matter has been settled and he has no objection in quashing the proceedings. 3. The learned Public Prosecutor on_ instructions submitted that that dispute has been settled between the parties. 2017/KER/1517 Cri. M. C. No. 7811 of 2016 2 It is further pointed out by the learned Public Prosecutor that the 1** accused is involved in another crime under Sections 153A and 307 IPC and the 2\" accused is involved in another proceeding under Section 395 IPC. The other petitioners are not involved in any other case. 4. It is evident that, antecedents of at least the 1*%* and 2\" accused are not very appreciable. Though this may dissuade the court from not permitting to quash the proceeding, taking into consideration the fact that the other petitioners are not involved in any other crime and the allegations herein is also not very serious, | am inclined to take a lenient view and to permit the parties to have their disputes resolved to give an effect to the settlement arrived at, on a belief that the petitioner herein will mend their ways and will not get themselves involved in any other future crime. In the light of the above, Crl.M.C. is allowed. All further proceedings in Crime No.620/2012 of Nadapuram Police Station stand quashed. Sd/- : SUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE. n"
