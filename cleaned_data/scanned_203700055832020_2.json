BY ADV.SRI.E.C.BINEESH, PUBLIC PROSECUTOR THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 04.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: * The name of the Police Station is corrected and substituted as Ramamangalam Police Station, as per order dated 22/02/2021 in Cr1.M.A.1/2021, instead of Puthencruz Police Station. Sd/- Assistant Registrar rape Crl.MC.No.5583 OF 2020(G) 202U/KER/108 2 ORDER An order accepting the refer report under Section 173(2) Cr.P.C. is under challenge by the defacto complainant on the ground that sufficient opportunity was not afforded to lodge a protest complaint and the counsel engaged was not acted properly. A mere perusal of the final report submitted would prima facie show the extensive nature of the offence alleged. Even going by the final report, it is prima faicie evident that the petitioner had sustained heavy loss in connection with the alleged transactions. The default on part of the counsel cannot be a ground to deny the valuable rights vested with the complainant to lodge a protest complaint on a refer report. For securing the ends of justice, it is fit and proper to quash the order passed by the learned Magistrate accepting the final report so as to afford an opportunity to the petitioner to lodge his protest complaint within a stipulated time. rape Crl.MC.No.5583 OF 2020(G) 2021/KER/108 3 The order dated 01.10.2019 is hereby quashed by allowing the petitioner to lodge his protest complaint within one month from the date of receipt of a copy of this order, failing which, the Magistrate will be at liberty to accept the refer report. The parties shall appear before the learned Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kolenchery on 20.01.2021. The Crl.M.C. is allowed accordingly. Sd/- P.
