SRI.VISHNUPRASAD NAIR RESPONDENT: THE STATE OF KERALA REPRESENTED BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR, HIGH COURT OF KERALA, ERNAKULAM 682 031 SRI.B.JAYASURYA SR PP THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 08.01.2020, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: pees Crl.MC.No.8368 OF 2019 (E) 2020/KER/BIO 2 ORDER Dated this the 8th day of January 2020 The petitioner is aggrieved by the impugned order of the learned Sessions Judge at Annexure A2, where the bail granted to the petitioner in crime No. 265/2019 of Kodakkara Police Station was cancelled for the reason that he failed to comply with condition no.4 which insisted that he shall not get involved in any other crime during the pendancy of the bail. The bail was granted on 09/07/2019, but soon thereafter on 13/07/2019, he got involved in another crime as crime No. 322/2019 of Kodakkara Police Station and consequent to that, the learned Sessions Judge cancelled the bail granted to him by way of impugned order. The petitioner is aggrieved and is before this Court. 2. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that as per Annexure Al, the defacto complainant in Crime No. 322/2019 has filed an affidavit stating that the petitioner was not involved. The FIR also does not show his name. It gives the name of two persons and other five are unidentified. The learned Sessions Judge had considered the said affidavit and has pees Crl.MC.No.8368 OF 2019 (E) 2020/KER/BIO 3 stated that for the purpose of granting of bail, the petitioner and accused Ratheesh had approached the defacto complainant and requested his father to say before the Court that the petitioner was not involved among the other accused. His father is a sick person and out of fear of the accused, his father went to the office of the lawyer of the accused and instructed filing an affidavit. Only in order to keep the word of his father, the defacto complainant reached the Court and informed that the petitioner, Sreekuttan was not involved in that crime. It is apparent that it is out of fear and coercion that he had made such a statement in the affidavit filed before the Court. The learned Sessions Judge on understanding these circumstances cancelled the bail granted to- the petitioner. I find no reason whatsoever to interfere in this finding and _ therefore, the criminal MC is dismissed.
