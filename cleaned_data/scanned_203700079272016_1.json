RESPONDENT (S)' EXHIBITS NIL /TRUE COPY/ K.V. P.S.TO JUDGE BE apa 2017/KER/49781 B. KEMAL PASHA, J. Dated this the 8\" day of December, 2017 ORDER Petitioners are the accused in Annexure-! private complaint filed before the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court, Kalpetta, which was referred to the police under Section 156 (3) Cr.PC., on the basis of which the police promptly registered Annexure-Il FIR for the offence under Section 420 read with Section 34 IPC. 2. The facts are very strange. The de _ facto complainant in Annexure-ll and the 2\" petitioner herein were the partners of a partnership firm named 'Wayanad Estates. The firm has a huge extent of properties, and the 2 petitioner was the share holder of 73% of shares in the partnership. Alleging that 1 respondent herein, who is the Bal 2017/KER/49781 Crl.M.C.7927/2016 >. de facto complainant in Annexure-ll, had forged and fabricated documents showing that the 2\" petitioner has retired from the said partnership, the 2\" petitioner preferred a complaint before the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court, Kalpetta, on the basis of which Annexure-V FIR was registered in Crime No.422/2016 of Meppadi Police Station. Immediately thereafter, Annexure-| complaint was preferred by the de facto complainant in Annexure-Il and got Crime No.505/2016 registered. 3. The petitioners have produced documents to show that the forged deed of retirement allegedly fabricated by the 1 respondent herein was produced before the Registrar of Firms to see that the retirement is recorded. Notice was issued by the Registrar of Firms to the 2\" petitioner. The 2 petitioner immediately preferred objections on the basis of which, Annexure-lll order was passed by the Registrar of Firms and information was passed on to the 2\" petitioner. The Registrar of Firms took Bal 2017/KER/49781 Crl.M.C.7927/2016 4. the view that there was no retirement and therefore, the retirement was not recorded. 4. On-going through Annexure-Il as well as Annexure-l, it seems that the allegation is that after obtaining the entire amounts towards the share of the 2\" petitioner from the 1* respondent, she has retracted from the transfer and by alleging falsehood, preferred the complaint in respect of Annexure-V FIR. On the said allegation, an offence under Section 420 IPC read with Section 34 IPC has been incorporated in Annexure-ll FIR. 5. On hearing either side, it has come out that Annexure-| complaint as well as Annexure-ll FIR are quite unnecessary and the same were just as a retaliatory measure to the actions initiated by the 2 petitioner, who is a 75 year old woman. Matters being so, all further proceedings in Crime No.505/2016 based on Annexure-ll and Annexure-| are liable to be quashed. In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-| Peas apo 2017/KER/49781 Crl.M.C.7927/2016 14: complaint and Annexure-ll FIR in Crime No.505/2016 of Meppadi Police Station and all further proceedings as against the petitioners in it, are quashed.
