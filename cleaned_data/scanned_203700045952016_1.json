A. TO JUDGE Pn . bine 2016/KER/33884 SUNIL THOMAS, J. Dated this the 3\" day of August, 2016 ORDER These Crl.M.C.s arise from C.C.No.105/2016 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Koothattukulam in Crime No.267/2016 of Koothattukulam Police Station for offences punishable under Sections 143, 144, 147, 148, 341, 323, 324, 326, 354, 506(ii), 427, 294(b) read with Section 149 of IPC. C.C.No.164/2016 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Koothattukulam arises from Crime No.278/2016 _ for Koothattukulam Police Station for offences punishable under Sections 341, 323, 324 read with Section 34 of IPC. 2. In C.C.No.105/2016, the allegation is that, the petitioners herein had attacked the defacto complainant and others and caused bodily injuries. One person sustained dislocation of his shoulder bone. On the basis of the complaint lodged, crime was registered. After investigation, final report was laid. 3. In C.C.No.164/2016, the allegation of the prosecution is that, the petitioners herein who are the defacto complainant in C.C.No.105/2016 had attacked the respondents herein who are . bine 2016/KER/33884 Cri. M. C. Nos. 4595 & 4596 of 2016 ; the accused in C.C.No.105/2016 and caused bodily injuries. On the basis of a complaint lodged, crime was registered and after investigation final report was filed. 4. Pending the proceedings, both parties have approached this Court stating that the respective cases have been resolved between the accused and the defacto complainant in each case. In Crl.M.C. 4595/2016 affidavits have been filed by the defacto complainant and the injured as Annexures A3, A4 and A5. In Cri.M.C. No.4596/2016 affidavits have been filed by the defacto complainant and the 2 respondent injured as Annexures A3 and A4. 5. The learned Public Prosecutor on_ instructions submitted that the petitioners herein are not involved in any other crime. It appears that, regarding the running of quarry, there was certain disputes between the management and locals, which seems to have led to this case and counter case. Since both sides have resolved to settle the issue and to give a quietus to the entire litigation, | feel that, it is liable to be permitted. Even though, in Crime No.267/2016 there is an offence alleged is one including Section 326, having regard to the fact that the injury is Dipset oe 2016/KER/33884 Cri. M. C. Nos. 4595 & 4596 of 2016 3 only a dislocation of the shoulder bone and not on a very vital part of the body, | am inclined to grant permission to settle the dispute. In the result, Crl.M.C.s are allowed and all further proceedings C.C.Nos.105/2016 & 164/2016 of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Koothattukulam stand quashed. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE. Pn"
