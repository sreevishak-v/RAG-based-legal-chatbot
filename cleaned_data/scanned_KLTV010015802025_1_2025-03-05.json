Rajan and Aneesh N.S Counter Petitioners/Respondents:- 1. Station House Officer, Nedumangad Police Station 2. State of Kerala By Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumary Criminal M.C.No.658/2025 1/5 This petition came up for hearing on 04/03/2025 and the court on 05/03/2025 passed the following : ORDER This is the 2 application filed by accused Nos. 1, 2 and 3 in the above crime under Section 483 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking regular bail. 2. The petitioners/ accused Nos. 1, 2 and 3 are alleged to have committed the offences punishable under Sections 296(b), 115(2), 118(1) and 109(1), r/w Section 3(5)of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. 3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- On 04.01.2025 at about 10.30 p.m., while the defacto complainant was consuming liquor in Central Plaza Bar, Nedumangad, accused Nos.1 to 3 abused him and brutally assaulted him. It is alleged that, the 1* accused slapped on the right cheek of the defacto complainant and accused Nos.2 and 3 beat him on his back, pushed him down and kicked on his legs. Thereafter, the 1 accused uttered abusive words against the defacto complainant and beat him on his head twice, using a beer bottle and a steel jug, causing severe injuries on his head, and thereby attempted to kill him. 4. Reportedly, the petitioners/accused Nos. 1, 2 and 3 were arrested on 06.01.2025 and they are in custody since then. Criminal M.C.No.658/2025 2/5 5. The earlier bail application filed by the petitioners was dismissed by this Court as per Order dated 14.02.2025 in Criminal M.C.No. 433/2025. 6. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The Investigating Officer filed report opposing the bail application. 7. Heard. Perused the records. 8. The only point to be considered is, whether regular bail can be granted to the petitioners/accused Nos. 1, 2 and 3. 9. The Point:- The petitioners/accused Nos. 1, 2 and 3 are alleged to have abused the defacto complainant, and attacked him, using beer bottle and steel jug, causing serious injuries. The motive for the alleged incident is that the defacto complainant stared at the accused, while they were consuming liquor in a Bar Hotel. 10. The petitioners submitted that, in fact, a scuffle occurred inside the Central Plaza Bar, Nedumangad, between the defacto complainant and his friends, and in order to avoid the rumpus, the petitioners intervened in the matter, and at that time, the defacto complainant abused them and fisted on the face of the 3\" accused. It is submitted that, due to the sudden provocation from the side the defacto complainant, the accused also hit him on his face, and at that time, a group of people, who were inside the bar, attacked the defacto complainant with a beer Criminal M.C.No.658/2025 3/5 bottle, and as a result, he sustained injuries. According to the petitioners, they are innocent of the allegations levelled against them and they have not committed any offence as alleged. 11. The magnitude of the offence alleged is grave. However, it is seen from the report filed by the Investigating Officer that the beer bottles and steel jug used for the commission of the offence were recovered, and the wound certificate of the victim was obtained. It appears that major part of the Investigation is over. The petitioners/ accused Nos. 1 to 3 are in judicial custody for a period of 58 days. So even if the petitioners are released on bail, there is nothing much, which will adversely affect the investigation. It is stated in the report that the petitioners are involved in other crimes. But, considering all the other aspects discussed afore, including the period of incarceration, I am of the view that, the petitioners/accused Nos. 1 to 3 can be enlarged on bail subject to conditions. In the result, the petition is allowed and the petitioners/ accused Nos. 1 to 3 are granted bail on the following conditions:- (1) Petitioners/ accused Nos. 1 to 3 shall execute bail bond for Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) each with two solvent sureties for the like sum each to the satisfaction of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Nedumangadu. Criminal M.C.No.658/2025 4/5 (2) Petitioners shall appear before the Investigating Officer on every Monday between 10 a.m. and 12 noon for a period of 3 (three) months or till the final report is filed, whichever is earlier. (3) Petitioners shall not commit any offence while on bail. (4) Petitioners shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade them from disclosing such facts to the court or to any police officer or tamper with evidence. (5) Petitioners shall appear before the Investigating Officer as and when required by the Investigating Officer. (6) Petitioners shall fully co-operate with the investigation. In case of any violation of the above conditions or misuse of liberty, the prosecution or the defacto complainant is at liberty to approach jurisdictional court for cancellation of bail. Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and pronounced by me in Open Court on this the 5\" day of March, 2025. Sd/- NAZEERA S.
