A. TO JUDGE Pn S ape 2016/KER/33885 SUNIL THOMAS, J. Dated this the 3\" day of August, 2016 ORDER The petitioner herein is the 1* accused in S.C.No.1151/2010 of Assistant Sessions Court, Neyyattinkara arising from Crime No.219/2009 of Parassala Police Station for offences punishable under Sections 354, 511 of 366 and read with Section 34 of IPC. 2. The allegation of the prosecution was that, the defacto complainant had complained to the teacher against the misconduct of the petitioner herein. As a retaliation, two weeks thereafter, on 29.04.2009 at 8.10 a.m., while the defacto complainant was proceeding from the College to the house, the petitioner herein came in a car, driven by the 2\" accused, stopped near her and the 1* accused caught hold of her and tried to pull her inside the car. This attracted others and the accused withdrew from the scene. 3. On the basis of the complaint laid, crime was registered. After investigation, final report was laid against both the accused. The 2\" accused is absconding and is not available. 4. Cri.M.C. is laid contending that the petitioner has compromised the dispute with the 1 respondent, the defacto S ape 2016/KER/33885 Crl. M. C. No. 4693 of 2016 2 complainant. It is stated that, the incident happened while both were studying in the College and they were around 18 years at that time. It was further submitted that, the parties have now settled in their life and after considerable thought, the defacto complainant had decided not to pursue with the case. An affidavit have been filed by the 1* respondent dated 20.07.2016. Learned counsel appearing for the 2\" respondent submitted that, she has been instructed to submit that the parties have resolved their disputes. The learned Public Prosecutor submitted that though the allegation is serious, the petitioner herein is not involved in any other crime. 5. Having regard to these facts, | feel that, at this length of time, one more opportunity can be granted to the petitioner to improve his way of life. Hence, | am inclined to quash the criminal proceedings. In the result, Crl.M.C. is allowed and all further proceedings in S.C.No.1151/2010 of Assistant Sessions Court, Neyyattinkara stand quashed.
