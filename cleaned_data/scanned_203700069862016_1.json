Dated this the 9\" day of January, 2017 ORDER The petitioner herein is the sole accused in C.C.No.557/2016 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate-II, Palakkad, for offence punishable under Section 27 (i) e, (iv) and (i) of Kerala Forest Act (Amendment Act, 1993), 1961. The crux of the allegation of the respondent is that, the petitioner herein had trespassed into the reserve forest, cleared the forest land, erected concrete fence posts, and thereby caused a loss of Rs.500/- to the Government. After investigation, final report was laid, for offences punishable under Sections 27(i) e(iv) and (i) of the Kerala Forest Act, 1961. The learned counsel for the petitioner relying on Annexure 2, title deed contended that the property has been validly assigned to the petitioner by the above registered documents and is in absolute possession of the property and that the land is not a forest land. 2. The learned Special Government Pleader for the forest, opposing the application, contended that the disputed property is rape 2017/KER/955 Crl.M.C.No. 6986 of 2016 2 a forest land. According to the counsel, the petitioner herein, had approached the Forest Tribunal, seeking exemption under Sections 3(2) and 3(3) of the Kerala Private Forests (Vesting and Assignment) Act, 1971. The learned counsel for the petitioner contented that, it was only an alternate prayer in the petition. Evidently, the question regarding the title, as now raised, is beyond the scope of consideration under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It is essentially for the courts vested with the appropriate authority, to adjudicate it and decide on the issue. Hence, I am not inclined to invoke Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. The Cri.M.C. fails and therefore, dismissed. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS , JUDGE. rmm/10/1/2017 // true copy // P.A to Judge rmm"
