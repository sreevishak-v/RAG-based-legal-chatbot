TO JUDGE SKS 2016/KER/42464 RAJA VITAYARAGHAVAN.YV., J ~ CrLM.C. No. 5563 of 2016 Dated 4' October, 2016 ORDER 1.This petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short the Code) has been preferred by the petitioners herein, who are the accused Nos. 1 and 2 in Crime No. 1426 of 2016 of the Perinthalmanna Police Station. The aforesaid crime has been registered for offences punishable under Section 3 and 4 of the Kerala Prohibition of Ragging Act, 1998. The 24 respondent is the de facto complainant. 2. The gist of the prosecution allegation is that on 13.11.2015 at about 11.45 am, the petitioners had subjected the 24 respondent to ragging inside the premises of the PTM Govt. College, Perinthalmanna. 3.The 2.4 respondent has entered appearance through the counsel and has filed Annexure-B affidavit wherein he asserts that he does not wish that the criminal 2016/KER/42464 Cril.M.C. No. 5563 of 2016 2 proceedings against the petitioners should continue. The learned counsel appearing for the 24 respondent/ de facto complainant would invite the attention of this court to Annexure-A, complaint filed by him before the Prinicipal of the College. According to him, he had only complained that the petitioners had asked him not to wear trousers which drooped down from his waist and branded footwear. According to the 24 respondent, the disputes have been amicably resolved and he does not wish the criminal proceedings as against the petitioners should continue any further. 4.The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submits that in view of the settlement arrived at between the parties, this Court will be justified in quashing the proceedings. 5.The learned Public Prosecutor after getting instructions has expressed his reservations in the matter of quashing the proceedings on the basis of settlement. It is submitted that the invocation of powers under Section 482 2016/KER/42464 Cril.M.C. No. 5563 of 2016 3 of the Code in a case of this nature is not warranted. However, it is submitted that no other cases are reported against the petitioners. 6.In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and Another [2012 (10)SCC 303], the Apex Court has crystalised the position in respect of the powers vested in the High Court under S.482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, to quash criminal proceedings. It was held that the power vested in the High Court under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, is not limited to quashing proceedings within the ambit and scope of Section 320 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The three - Judge Bench in the above case, clearly expounded, that quashing of criminal proceedings under S.482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, could also be based on settlements between private parties, and could also on a compromise between the offender and the victim. Only that, the above power did not extend to crimes against the society. It is also relevant to mention, that the jurisdiction vested in the High Court under 2016/KER/42464 Cril.M.C. No. 5563 of 2016 4 Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, for quashing criminal proceedings, was held to be exercisable in criminal cases having an overwhelming and predominatingly civil flavour, particularly offences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership, or such like transactions. Further, guidelines were issued by the Apex Court in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [2014 (6) SCC 466] and recently in Rajesh Kamath J. and Others v. Mohana Kurup and Others [AIR 2016 SC 2452]. 7.1 have considered the rival submissions and I have gone through the materials on record. The offence committed by the petitioners cannot be said to be grave and serious having ingredients of extreme mental depravity. It also does not appear that the offence in this case will have a serious impact on the society. More over, when the respondent No.2 has settled the matter, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and the continuation of the criminal case against the petitioners would be a futile ohn SL aer aba 2016/KER/42464 Crl.M.C. No. 5563 of 2016 5 exercise. It would also put the petitioners and the 2\" respondent to great oppression and prejudice. 8.Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I am of the considered view that this Court will be well justified in invoking its extra ordinary powers under Section 482 of the Code to quash the proceedings. In the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-A FIR in Crime No. 1426 of 2015 of the Perinthalmanna Police Station and all proceedings pursuant thereto against the petitioners are quashed.
