SMT. V. SREEJA (PP) THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 18.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Dee al 2024/KER/4446 CRL.MC 549/2024 2 BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J arena ORDER Petitioner is the accused in S.T.No.2777/2017 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Chalakkudy. Petitioner is facing prosecution for the offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. Due to the failure on the part of the petitioner to appear before the trial court, a non bailable warrant has been issued. Hence, this petition. 2. Sri.Praveen K.Joy, the learned counsel for the petitioner, submitted that summons had not been served on the petitioner and therefore he was unaware of the specific posting date. It is also submitted that petitioner is willing to appear before the trial court and seek bail, especially since the offence is a bailable one. 3. I have heard the learned Public Prosecutor as_ well. Considering the nature of order that I propose to pass, notice Bane a Bipot 2024/KER/4446 CRL.MC 549/2024 3 to the 2\" respondent is dispensed with. 4. Since the petitioner is an accused in an offence punishable under Section 138 of NI Act, I am of the view that the learned Magistrate ought to consider the application for bail and recall of warrant on the same day itself. 5. Accordingly, there will be a direction to the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Chalakkudy, to consider the application for recall of warrant and for grant of bail, if any, filed by the petitioner in S.T.No.2777/2017 positively on the same day of his appearance. The Crl.M.C.is disposed of. sd/- BECHU KURIAN THOMAS JUDGE AMV/19/01/2024 2024/KER/4446 CRL.MC 549/2024 4 APPENDIX OF CRL.MC 549/2024 PETITIONER ANNEXURES ANNEXURE 1 TRUE COPY OF THE SECTION 82 NOTICE ISSUED FROM JUDICIAL FIRST CLASS MAGISTRATE COURT, CHALAKKUDY DATED 03.01.2024 ANNEXURE 2 TRUE COPY OF THE E-COURT PROCEEDINGS DATED 11.12.2023 TRUE COPY"
