BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR, HIGH COURT OF KERALA, ERNAKULAM-682031, THROUGH STATION HOUSE OFFICER, HARIPAD POLICE STATION, ALAPPUZHA DISTRICT, BY SRI.C.N.PRABHAKARAN, SENIOR PUBLIC PROSECUTOR THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 05-01-2018, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: RAV 2018/KER/455 SUNIL THOMAS, J Cri.M.C.No.106 of 2018 Dated this the 5 day of January, 2018 ORDER The petitioner herein is the sole accused in CC.No.501/2013 of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Haripad arising from Crime No.519/2012 of Haripad Police Station for offences punishable under section 498A of the Indian Penal Code. 2. According to the petitioner herein, he was granted bail by this court and accordingly he had appeared before the court below and was enlarged on bail. The matter was referred for Adalath. In the meanwhile, the petitioner went abroad. The mediation had failed. Since he did not appear before the court below, non bailable warrant was issued. Since his presence could not be procured, the case was consigned to the LP register and is now pending as LP.No.30/2015. 3. The petitioner herein contends that the petitioner is willing to appear before the court below and Crl.M.C.No.106 of 2018 NEES 2 to participate in all further proceedings by his personal attendance or through his counsel. The only apprehension of the petitioner herein is that, since non bailable warrant was ordered, and the case considered the LP register, there is a possibility that the bail application proposed to be filed by him is not likely to be taken up on the same day and he may be remanded. 4. Having considered the explanation offered that the petitioner herein was abroad and also considering the nature of allegations which is only one under section 498A, arising from a matrimonial dispute, I feel that the request made by the petitioner herein is reasonable and can be granted. Essentially, the non bailable warrant is issued to procure the presence of the accused and if once it is ensured, there is no reason as to why he should be remanded. Having considered these facts, I am inc lied to dispose of the Crl.M.C with a direction that the petitioner herein shall appear before the court below within a period of ten days from today and file appropriate applications for recalling the warrant Pieieias hl apt 2018/KER/455 Crl.M.C.No.106 of 2018 3 and also for bail. He shall deposit a sum of Rs.5000/- towards the portion of the bond amount before the court below. If the above conditions are satisfied, the court below shall take up the applications to be filed by the petitioner herein, on the same day of his appearance itself and pass appropriate orders on the same day having regard to what is stated above. The warrant issued by the court below will be kept in abeyance till his actual date of appearance within the above ten days. Cri.M.C is disposed of as above.
