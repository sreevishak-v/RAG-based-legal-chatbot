RESPONDENT(S)\" ANNEXURES : NIL [TRUE COPY// PA.TO JUDGE Msd. Be 2016/KER/33674 RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.YV., J Cri.M.C. Nos. 4883 & 4885 of 2016 Dated 1* August, 2016 ORDER 1.The petitioner is the 1* accused in C.C.Nos. 587 of 2011 and 1035 of 2015 of the Judicial Magistrate of 1* Class, Thaliparamba. He is proceeded against for having committed offences punishable under Section 420 read with Section 34 of the IPC. 2.The prosecution allegation in these cases is that the petitioner was running a travel agency in the name and style as Style Starlime Travels' and he offered Visa to respective de facto complainants after accepting money from them. He failed to issue Visa as assured which resulted in the registration of crimes against him. The petitioner was enlarged on bail as per order dated 23.9.2015 subject to stringent conditions. 3.The petitioner is aggrieved by condition No.2 in the bail order which is extracted below for easy reference: rae 2016/KER/33674 Crl.M.C. Nos.4883 &4885 of 2016 -2- 2. He shall appear before the court on all posting dates, on the failure of which the bail bond shall stand automatically cancelled. 4.Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the learned Public Prosecutor. 5.It is submitted by the learned counsel that imposing such onerous condition is unconscionable. He is_ facing allegations in 9 cases and has been complying with the above condition without fail. Insisting upon him to appear before Court on routine postings and the condition that on his failure to appear even on a single day, the bail would stand automatically cancelled is a condition which is opposed to the basic tenets of a fair trial, is the submission of the learned Counsel. The petitioner is to ritualistically appear before the learned Magistrate in all the cases in which he is roped in as an accused even if no effective proceeding is scheduled to take place before Court on that particular day. The bail order was passed a year back and it is prayed that necessary orders be passed modifying the said condition. s016iKERI3674 Crl.M.C. Nos.4883 &4885 of 2016 -3- 6.The learned Public Prosecutor on instructions supported the order passed by the learned Magistrate and submitted that there is no need for interference at this stage. 7.Having bestowed my anxious considerations to the rival submissions and after going through the impugned order, I am of the firm view that the petitioner has made out a case for interference. The learned Magistrate, after having found that the petitioner was entitled to bail, imposed adequate conditions to secure his presence before Court. In view of the above the court was not justified in imposing a condition that even on the failure of the petitioner to appear before the learned Magistrate on a single posting date, his bail would be automatically cancelled. The petitioner is represented by a counsel all through and on postings when no effective transactions take place, he can always be represented by his lawyer. 8.Condition No 2 in Annexure 2 order will stand lifted. Instead it is ordered that if for some unavoidable reason, the petitioner is not able to appear before the learned BIER siz at He ree 2016/KER/33674 Crl.M.C. Nos.4883 &4885 of 2016 -4- Magistrate, the learned Magistrate shall not insist for his personal appearance and instead the petitioner shall be permitted to appear through counsel, provided application is filed seeking exemption for the day. All other conditions shall remain as such. The learned Counsel prays that the learned Magistrate be directed to post all the cases together or on alternate days. The learned Magistrate shall post the cases together or on alternate days if it is not otherwise inconvenient for any reason. The petitions are disposed off.
