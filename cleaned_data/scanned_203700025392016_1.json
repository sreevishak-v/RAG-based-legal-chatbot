Dated this the 1* day of June, 2016 ORDER The petitioners herein are the accused in Crime No.62/2009 of the Pandikkad Police Station registered for offences punishable under Sections 323, 324 read with Section 34 IPC. 2. On the basis of the complaint lodged, crime was registered and the matter is now pending as C.C.No.274/2009 before the Judicial First Class Magistrate - Il, Perinthalmanna. According to the parties, the dispute between the parties has been settled amicably and a compromise has been arrived at. It was submitted by both sides that they do not propose to proceed with the case. Annexure B to F are the affidavits sworn to by respondents 2 to 6 herein who are the victims/injured. 3. It was brought to my notice that a counter case was also initiated as Crime No.61/2009 resulting in C.C. No.275/2009 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-ll, Perinthalmanna. It was submitted by both sides that the above case was quashed by order of this Court in crl.M.C. No.1925/2016 dated 08.04.2016. A copy of the order was also made available. BREAST eek nie oes 2016/KER/23858 Cri. M. C. No. 2539 of 2016 2 4. It is eminently clear that the parties have settled their disputes amicably. Hence the continuance of further proceedings can also result in manifest injustice to the parties. Hence | am inclined to allow the Crl.M.C., quashing entire proceedings in C.C. No.274/2009 of the Judicial First Class Madgistrate-ll, Perinthalmanna. Crl.M.C. stands allowed. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE. /true copy/ P. A. to Judge Pn"
