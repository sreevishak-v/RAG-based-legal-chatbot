The petitioner herein along with nine other persons stood charge sheeted for offences punishable under the above provisions of law. All the accused except the petitioner herein faced the trial. By Annexure A2 Judgment, all the accused who faced the trial were acquitted on the ground that the prosecution failed to prove the allegation against the accused. The case against the petitioner herein was split up and re-filed. Since the accused again remained absent, it was relegated to the LP Register. 3. The petitioner has now approached this court contending that the matter has been settled between the parties, that in the light of Annexure A2 judgment, the substratum of the case is broken and that benefit should enure to him also. It was further submitted that the dispute has also been settled between the parties as is evident from Annexure A3 affidavit filed by the second Bie al 2017/KER/708 Cri.M.C.No.7382/2016 2 respondent. 4, Learned counsel for the second respondent relying on Annexure A3 affidavit, submitted that the matter has been settled. 5. Learned Public Prosecutor on instructions, submitted that the petitioner is not involved in any other crime and that the dispute has been resolved. 6. In the light of the above, I am satisfied that no purpose will be served at this length of time by proceeding against the petitioner herein. Having considered these facts in detail, I find that interest of justice demands,all the further proceedings against the petitioner should stand quashed. In the result, the Crl.M.C.is allowed. All further proceedings pursuant to SC No.1334/2010 now pending as LP No.13/2014 of the VI Additional Sessions Court, Kollam arising from crime NO.664/2004 of Kollam East Police Station stand quashed.
