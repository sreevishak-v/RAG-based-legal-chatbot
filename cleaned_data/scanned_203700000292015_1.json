No. 29 OF 2015 _ Dated this the 6\" day of January, 2015 ORDER The petitioner herein is the sole accused in C.C. No.1007/2013 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Manjeri. The crime in this case was registered under Sections 323,324 & 341 of I.P.C. on the complaint of one Nazar. The petitioner now seeks orders quashing the prosecution on the ground that he and the de facto complainant Nazar have come to terms amicably out of Court. The de facto complainant is the first respondent in this proceeding. He has filed affidavit to the effect that he has settled the dispute with the accused, and he has no grievance or complaint. I find that continuance of the prosecution in such a situation will not serve any purpose other than wasting the precious time of the Court. Nobody will support the prosecution, if the case goes to trial. In the result, the Crl.M.C is allowed. The prosecution against the petitioner in C.C. No. 1007/2013 of the Judicial Dear 2015/KER/216 Crl.M.C. No. 29 of 2014 22: First Class Magistrate Court-I, Manjeri will stand quashed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Accordingly, the petitioner will stand released from the prosecution and the bail bond, if any, executed by him will stand discharged. Sd/- P.UBAID, Judge. dpk /True copy/ PS to Judge."
