RESPONDENT(S)' ANNEXURES : NIL HTRUE COPY// P.S.TO JUDGE Msd. 2017/KER/49759 B. KEMAL PASHA, J. CRL.M.C. Nos. 5769 & 5781 of 2017, ORDER There was a delay in filing income tax return in these matters. According to the petitioners, the delay was not willful; whereas, the Department says that the delay was willful. According to the Department, the delay was willful in the sense that it was also a modus operandi to avoid the payment of tax. The learned counsel for the petitioners has pointed out that the petitioners were suffering from utter financial stringency and therefore, the return could not be filed in time. The return could be filed only on uploading the payment of the admitted tax. They were not in a position to pay the admitted tax and that is the reason why the delay had occurred. 2. Huge amounts were imposed on the petitioners as penalty. Of course, in case of such willful delay, and 2017/KER/49759 CRL.M.C.Nos. 5769 & 5781 of 2017 uoe concealment of income, it is for the Department to take such measures. 3. Now, an appeal has been filed and the matter is pending adjudication. In the mean time, the petitioners had approached this Court and the matters in the appeal stands stayed by the orders of this Court as is evident from Annexure N in Crl.M.C. No.5769 of 2017. In a similar situation this Court had occasion to pass Annexure O order in Cri.M.C.No.5769/2017. In this particular situation, this Court is of the view that the prosecution proceedings before the court below in these matters shall stand stayed, till the disposal of the appeal. In the result, these Crl.M.Cs. are disposed of by ordering that the prosecution proceedings before the court below in these matters shall stand stayed till the disposal of the appeal. Sd/- B.
