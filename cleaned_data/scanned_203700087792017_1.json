RESPONDENT(S) EXHIBITS NIL R.AV ITTRUE COPY// PA TO JUDGE SUNIL THOMAS, J EE Cri.M.C.No.8779 of 2017 Dated this the 3\" day of January, 2018 ORDER The petitioners herein are accused Nos.3,5 and 6 in Crime No.169/2010 of Chandera Police Station for offences punishable under sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 323, 324 read with section 149 of the Indian Penal Code. 2. It was alleged by the prosecution that on 27.3.2010, the petitioners herein, along with the co- accused attacked the defacto complainant and others due to political enmity. Crime was registered and after investigation, final report was filed. Cognizance was taken and the matter was pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Hosdurg as CC.No.1452/2011. All the accused except the petitioners herein faced the trial before the court below and were acquitted. The case against the petitioners was split up and is now pending as CC.No.130/2015 of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Hosdurg. 3. The petitioners have approached this court 2018/KER/47 Crl.M.C.No.8779 of 2017 ; contending that in the light of the acquittal of the co- accused on merits, the substratum of the case is broken and a successful prosecution of the petitioners herein is not possible. It was also submitted that the disputes have now been resolved. The learned counsel for the petitioners invited my attention to paragraph 7 of Annexure-A3 judgment, which discloses that the parties have resolved their dispute. It is stated that PW1 referred to a counter case which was also settled between the parties. He turned hostile and did not support the prosecution case. PW2 and PW3 who were injured persons did not support the prosecution case. Hence it is clear that with this quality of evidence, a successful prosecution of the petitioners herein is not possible. The learned Public Prosecutor on instructions submitted that Annexure-A3 judgment was not subjected to any appeal and the matter has become final. 4. Having considered these facts, I feel that a successful prosecution of the petitioners herein is not 2018/KER/47 Crl.M.C.No.8779 of 2017 3 possible. Hence Crl.M.C is liable to be allowed. 5. However, it is pertinent to note that though the crime is of the year 2010, the petitioners herein remained elusive and did not participate in the judicial proceedings. The case against them was split up and refiled. This has caused considerable delay in the judicial proceedings. Having considered this, I am inclined to invoke the jurisdiction under section 482 Cr.P.C only subject to payment of cost by each of the petitioner. Hence Crl.M.C will stand allowed and all further proceedings in CC.No.130/2015 of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Hosdurg arising from Crime No.169/2010 of Chandera Police Station stand quashed on condition that each of the petitioner deposits a sum of Rs.1500/- to the Kerala State Mediation and Conciliation Committee, High Court of Kerala, Ernakulam. within one month from today and produce proof before this court.
