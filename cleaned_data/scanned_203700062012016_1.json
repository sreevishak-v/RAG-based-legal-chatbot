CC No.480/2011 arises from Crime No.119/1990 of Vadakkekad Police Station and Crl.M.C. No. 1192/2014 relates to that crime. The grievance of the petitioner in Crl.M.C.

According to the petitioner, while the trial in CC No. 590/2010 had reached its fag end, the 5 respondent herein filed an application for simultaneous trial along with CC No.480/2011. It was allowed by Annexure-IX order. The petitioner apprehends thai, it will further delay the proceedings. 2.

Nos.590/2010 and 480/2011 are being proceeded with and both the cases can be disposed of within a period of 6 months time.
