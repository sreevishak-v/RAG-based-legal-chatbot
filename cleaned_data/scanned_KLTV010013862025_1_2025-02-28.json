No.569/2025 (Crime No.153/2024 of Cyber Crime Police Station, Thiruvananthapuram City, pending before Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Thiruvananthapuram) Petitioner/Accused No.1 :- Manu K., aged 28 years, S/o Madhu, House No.23/195 Palazhy Veedu, Velimukku South, Munniyoor, Malappuram (By Advocates Shaju Chandran R. & Rahul Krishnan R.) Counter Petitioner:- Station House Officer, Ciber Crime Police Station, Thiruvananthapuram. (By Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumari) This Crl.M.C. came up for hearing on 25/2/2025 and the court on the 28/2/2025 passed the following : Criminal M.C.No.569/2025 1/5 ORDER This is the 2 application filed by the 1 accused in the above crime under Section 483 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking regular bail. 2. The petitioner/ 1* accused is alleged to have committed the offences punishable under Sections 419, 420, 465, 467, 468 and 471, r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, and Section 66D of the Information Technology Act. 3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- The accused, 16 in number, with an intention to cheat the defacto complainant, by committing forgery, misrepresentation and impersonation, obtained from him a substantial amount to the tune of Rs.1.99 Crores, allegedly for the purpose of online trading, and thereafter, misappropriated it. It is alleged that, the 1* accused compelled the defacto complainant to install various applications in his mobile phone, and thereafter, made him transfer substantial amounts to the accounts of accused Nos. 2 to 13, and thereafter, siphoned off the money by transferring it to various other accounts. Criminal M.C.No.569/2025 2/5 4. Reportedly, the petitioner/ 1 accused was arrested on 02.01.2025 and he is in custody since then. 5. The earlier bail application filed by the petitioner was dismissed by this Court as per Order dated 30.01.2025 in Criminal M.C.No. 218/2025. 6. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The Investigating Officer filed report opposing the bail application. 7. Heard. Perused the records. 8. | The only point to be considered is, whether regular bail can be granted to the petitioner/ 1* accused. 9. The Point:- The petitioner / 1* accused along with the other accused is alleged to have cheated the defacto complainant by inducing him to transfer a total sum of Rs.1.99 Crores to the accounts of accused Nos. 2 to 13, under the pretext of online trading, and thereafter, siphoned off the money by transferring to various other accounts of the accused. 10. The petitioner submits that, he has not committed any offence as Criminal M.C.No.569/2025 3/5 alleged by the prosecution and he has been falsely implicated in this case. It is submitted that, the sim cards of the petitioner were misused and committed impersonation by some persons. 11. There is serious allegation as against the petitioner, which is based on a stock market trading. The contention raised by the petitioners counsel is that, the defacto comlainant has involved in the online trading with full awareness of the transaction. It is seen from the report filed by the Investigating Officer that, it is the petitioner herein, who had contacted the defacto complainant through Whatsapp and fradulently conducted share trading and illegally obtained around Rs.2 crores. So the prima facie case against the petitioner and the involvement of the petitioner is made out by the prosecution. The investigation is progressing. The learned Public Prosecutor strongly opposed the application stating that at the time of the commission of the alleged offence, the petitioner was in Cambodia and he had created fake ID and collected money and there is chance of absconding, if he is released on bail. It is seen from the report filed by the Investigating Officer that the money collected by the petitioner / 1* accused was Criminal M.C.No.569/2025 4/5 transferred to several accounts in different States and that the transaction details of those accounts are yet to be collected. It is seen that the petitioner herein is the prime accused in the offence alleged. So, if the petitioner is released on bail at this stage, he is likely to influence the defacto complainant and the witnesses and tamper with the evidence. The chance of absconding also cannot be ruled out. Further, no change in circumstances is brought out after the dismissal of the earlier bail application. Considering all these aspects, including the gravity of the offence, this court is not inclined to release the petitioner on bail at this stage. In the result, this petition is dismissed. Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and pronounced by me in Open Court on this the 28\" day of February, 2025.
