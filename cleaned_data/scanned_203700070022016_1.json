RESPONDENT (S)' EXHIBITS : NIL /TRUE COPY/ P. A. TO JUDGE Pn 2017/KER/236 SUNIL THOMAS, J. Dated this the 4 day of January, 2017 ORDER The husband, who is the 1* accused in CC No.564/2011 of Additional Chief Judicial Court, Thiruvananthapuram, charged with offences punishable under Sections 498A, 323, 324, 506(ii), 34 IPC has filed this Crl.M.C. under Section 482 Cr.P.C. 2. Petitioner married the complainant on 07.05.2006. The petitioner was employed in Military Service. Matrimonial discord led to the lodging of the complaint alleging matrimonial cruelty against the husband and in-laws. Her allegation was that she was subjected to matrimonial cruelty both physically and mentally on various occasions. The contention of the husband is that, he was always away from home except when he came on leave. There could not have been any harassment during the limited days of leave. The allegations in the complaint are inherently improbable. Hence, he sought to quash the proceedings. 3. The complaint and the statement of the wife show that, after two months of marriage, husband left to his work place in Jammu Kashmir. She became pregnant and during that period 2017/KER/236 Cri. M. C. No. 7002 of 2016 2 she was subjected to cruelty by in-laws. After delivery, the husband came down, but he behaved very cruelly towards her. When she was thrown out from the house, husband supported the in-laws. She has stated another instance when she was subjected to physical cruelty by the petitioner, along with other accused. 4. It is clear that even though, husband was away, his direct and indirect role is narrated by the complainant. In the above circumstance, it cannot be said that no allegation is made out. Hence, | am not inclined to invoke Section 482 Cr.P.C. Crl.M.C. fails and is dismissed. Sd/- SUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE. Pn"
