Dated this the 4\" day of January, 2018 ORDER Heard. On a perusal of the complaint and the allegations against the 2 accused, who is the petitioner herein, it seems that at the most the complaint is one of breach of contract and nothing more. It cannot invite an offence under Section 420 IPC as against the petitioner. 2. Even though, the learned counsel for the 2\" respondent has argued that some documents were forged by the 2 accused, there is no such allegation in the complaint. Matters being so, all further proceedings in Crime No.1337/2017 of the Hill Palace Police Station as against the petitioner herein can be quashed. In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and all further proceedings as against the petitioner in Crime No.1337/2017 of the Hill Palace Police Station are hereby quashed. Sd/- B. KEMAL PASHA, JUDGE. se // True Copy // P.A. to Judge"
