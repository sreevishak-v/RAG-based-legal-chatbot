In view of such a report, the prosecution was directed by this Court on 22.11.2017 to file a report as to whether the crime as against the petitioner is being referred, or whether he has been removed from the array of accused. Now it is submitted by the learned Public Prosecutor that the investigating officer has already filed report in the court below on 09.08.2017 dropping the further proceedings les 2018/KER/717 Cri.M.C. No. 6480 of 2014 -2- against the petitioner. If so, there is no proceeding to be quashed by this Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C.. The submission made by the learned Public Prosecutor is recorded in the proceedings. In case anything happened otherwise, contrary to the submissions made by the learned Public Prosecutor, the officer who gave instructions to the learned Public Prosecutor will have to be dealt with, and appropriate proceedings can be initiated by the petitioner.
