KEMAL PASHA, J. a ea ee ORDER The petitioner is the 4 accused in Crime No.713 of 2007 of the Kasaragod Police Station, presently pending as L.PC.No.3 of 2009 in C.RNo.102/2008 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-l, Kasaragod, registered for the offences punishable under Sections 341, 323, 324, 506(ii) and 308 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. 2. As the petitioner was not in place, the case against him was split up and it is presently pending as L.PC.No.3 of 2009 before the above court. The case against the other accused was numbered as S.C.No.355/2008 before the Additional Sessions Court, Kasaragod. The case was_- proceeded with in pete 2016/KER/59 CRL.M.C.No. 7719 of 2015 ue S.C.No.355/2008, which has culminated in the acquittal of the other accused, through Annexure A2 judgment. On going through Annexure A2 judgment, it seems that there was no evidence against the accused and the witnesses did not support the prosecution case. Even if the prosecution against the present petitioner is continued, there will not be any chance for conviction. In such case, there is no meaning in proceeding with the prosecution case. 3. Moreover, on going through the matter, this Court is satisfied that there are no ingredients to invite an offence under Section 308 IPC in the matter. It seems that the matter has been amicably settled between the parties. The defacto complainant, who is the 2\"? respondent and the two other injured have filed separate affidavits as Annexures A3(a) to (c) affirming that the matter has been amicably settled between them and the petitioner and they have no complaints against the petitioner. When the matter has been amicably settled between the parties, no purpose pete 2016/KER/59 CRL.M.C.No. 7719 of 2015 ae would be served in proceeding with the matter any further. Matters being so, all further proceedings in L.RC.No.3 of 2009 in C.RNo.102/2008 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-l, Kasaragod, based on Annexure A-1 Final Report in Crime No.713 of 2007 of the Kasaragod Police Station, can be quashed. In the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and all further proceedings in L.RC.No.3 of 2009 in C.PNo.102/2008 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-l, Kasaragod, based on Annexure A-1 Final Report in Crime No.713 of 2007 of the Kasaragod Police Station, are hereby quashed.
