CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON\n24.11.2020, THE COURT ON 08.01.2021 PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nCr1.MC. 4820/2020 2 2021/KER/1295\nV.G.ARUN, J.\nDated this the 8\" day of January, 2021\nORDER\n\nPetitioner is the accused in C.C.No.630 of 2020 on the files of the\nJudicial First Class Magistrate-l, Kannur. Based on the final report filed\nin Crime No.30 of 2020 of Kannapuram Police Station, the court took\ncognizance for the offences under Sections 279 and 337 of IPC and\n185 of the Motor Vehicles Act. The prosecution allegation is that, at\nabout 4 p.m. On 21.1.2020, the petitioner had driven his car in a rash\nand negligent manner so as to endanger human life and had dashed\nagainst another car, resulting in the driver and passenger of the other\ncar sustaining injuries. The petitioner was arrested and subjected to\nmedical examination, upon which the doctor opined that the petitioner\nsmelled of alcohol.\n\n2. The challenge in this Crl.M.C is primarily against inclusion of\nthe offence under Section 185 of the M.V.Act. The challenge is based\non the ground that the offence under Section 185 would be attracted\nonly when alcohol content is detected through breath analyser test. It\nis contended that no such test havig been conducted, the entire\nprosecution is illegal. Reliance is placed on the decision of this Court in\n\nCr1.MC. 4820/2020 3 202 1U/KER/1295\nSagimon v. State of Kerala [2014(3) KLT 782] and Annexure A3\norder in Crl.M.C.No.5562 of 2019.\n\n3. A perusal of the memo of evidence appended to the final\nreport shows that the doctor's certificate is with regard to the injuries\nsustained by the petitioner and others as a result of the accident. No\nmention is made about breath analyser test or any other test\nconducted for the purpose of finding the alcohol content in the\npetitioner's blood. As per Section 185, whoever, while driving or\nattempting to drive a motor vehicle (a) has in his blood alcohol\nexceeding 30 mg per 100 ml of blood detected in a test by a breath\nanalyser or in any other test including a laboratory test, is liable for\npunishment. Therefore, in order to attact the offence under Section\n185(a), the accused should have been subjected to a breath analyser\nor any other test including a laboratory test and his blood found to\ncontain alcohol exceeding 30 mg per 100 ml. The mandatory\nrequirement of conducting a breath analyser test was elaborately dealt\nwith by this Court in Sagimon's case (supra). The ingredients of\nSection 185(a) was considered in Annexure 3 judgment also. Both\ndecisions were rendered on interpretation of Section 185(a) prior to its\namendment, which mandated detection of blood alcohol level through\na breath analyser test. After the amendment, other tests, including\nlaboratory test, can be resorted for determining alcohol content in\nblood. But, as far as the instant case is concerned, no such test is seen\n\nCr1.MC. 4820/2020 4 2021/KER/1295\nto have been conducted. Being so, the petitioner cannot be prosecuted\nfor the offence under Section 185 of the Motor Vehicles Act. Even\nthough the prayer is to quash the further proceedings as a whole, | find\nno sustainable ground for doing so.\n\nIn the result, the Crl.M.C is allowed to the limited extent of\nquashing further proceedings against the petitioner under Section 185\nof the Motor Vehicles Act. It is made clear that this order does not\npreclude the court from proceeding with the case for the other\noffences.\n\nSd/-\nV.G.ARUN, JUDGE\nvgs\n\nBe\naiEe 4\ngeen\nBlea\nCrl.MC. 4820/2020 5 2021/KER/1295\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE Al A TRUE COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT IN CRIME\nNO.30/2020 OF KANNAPURAM POLICE STATION,\nKANNUR DATED 8/3/2020\nANNEXURE A2 A MEDICAL CERTIFICATE IS ISSUED ON\n21.1.2020 FROM MARTIN DE PORRES HOSPITAL,\nCHERUKUNNU.
