The said crime was registered on the\ncomplaint of one Razak. The accused Nos. i and 2 faced trial\nbefore the learned Additional Sessions Judge Fast Track Court\nNo.III (Adhoc), Manjeri, in S.C.No. 153/2006, and obtained a\njudgment of acquittal on 23.01.2008 under Section 232 Cr.P.C.,\nwhen all the material witnesses turned hostile during trial. The\ncase against the petitioner herein was split up and refiled when\nhe consistently remained absent during the process. It is now\npending as S.C.No.413/2014 before the learned Assistant\nSessions Judge, Tirur. The petitioner now seeks orders quashing\nthe prosecution, on the ground that in the above circumstances\nof acquittal of the others in view of an amicable settlement,\ncontinuance of prosecution as against him will not serve any\npurpose.

No, 137/2015 2\n\nS.C.No.153/06 shows that in the said case where the accused\nNos. 1 and 2 faced trial, the prosecution examined five witnesses\nincluding the first informant, Razak, and marked Ext.P1. None of\nthe material witnesses supported the prosecution. The judgment\nalso shows that all the witnesses turned hostile in view of an\namicable settlement made between the parties out of court. In\nsuch a situation where there is no possibility of any of the\nwitnesses supporting the prosecution, and the prosecution cannot\n\nin any manner improve the case when case goes to trial,\ncontinuance of prosecution will be a sheer waste of time.\n\nIn the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed.
