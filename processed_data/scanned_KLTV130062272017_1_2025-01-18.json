After hearing prosecution and counsel\nfor accused No.1 charge framed for offence u/s. 13, 17 of Kerala Money\nLenders Act, 1958, read over and explained to the accused No.1 to which she\npleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. Police has filed a report stating that\nthe accused No.2 is no more. Copy of death certificate of accused No.2 is\nproduced. Hence, charge against him is abated.\n\n5. On the side of prosecution, PW1 and PW2 were examined. As the material\nwitnesses failed to support the prosecution case, the learned Assistant Public\nProsecutor gave up the CW3 and CW4. In the absence of any incriminating\ncircumstances against the accused No.1 questioning of the accused No.1 under\nsection 313(1)(b) Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 was dispensed with.\nAccused No.1 was called upon to adduce evidence but no defence evidence\nwas adduced from the side of the accused.\n\n4o0f5\n\n6.

PW1 denied his statement before the police and deposed that she had not\npreferred any complaint against the accused.\n\n10. The learned Assistant Public Prosecutor had given up other witnesses and she\nis justified in doing so as the material witness did not support the case of\nprosecution. Having considered evidence on record, this court is of the view\nthat prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of accused No.1. For the said\nreason this point is found against the prosecution.\n\n5 of 5\n11.
