SRI.ENOCH DAVID SIMON JOEL\nRESPONDENT (S) :\nSTATE OF KERALA\nREPRESENTED BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR\nHIGH COURT OF KERALA, ERNAKULAM\nBY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR: SRI T R RANJITH\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON\n05-01-2017, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\noe\n2017/KER/462\nSUNIL THOMAS, J.\nCrl.M.C.No.66 of 2017\nDated this the 5\" day of January, 2017\nORDER\n\nPetitioners are accused Nos.1 to 3 and 6 in C.C.No.612\n\nof 2009 of Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate,\n\nThiruvananthapuram for offences punishable under sections 143,\n\n147, 149, 283, 294(b), 332, 353 of the Indian Penal Code.\n\n2. Petitioners appeared before the court below through the\ncounsel in the above crime. Thereafter, they were either appearing\npersonally or were being represented by the counsel. The matter\nstood posted to 16.02.2016, on which day, petitioners were absent.\nHence, court below issued non bailable warrant against the\npetitioners. Bail bond was also cancelled.\n\n3. Petitioners, contending that due to an inadvertent\ncommunication gap with the counsel in informing about the case\nremained absent and that, there was no willful latches on their side\nhave approached this Court seeking reliefs. It is submitted that\npetitioners are ready to surrender before the magistrate and to seek\nfresh bail. They apprehend that since the non bailable warrant is\npending, application for bail is not likely to be taken up on the same\n\na\n2017/KER/462\nCrl.M.C.66/17\n2\nday of surrender itself.\n\nA. Having considered the entire facts, I feel that since the\npetitioners have been appearing promptly before the court earlier,\nsome leniency can be shown to the petitioners herein. This is\nespecially in the background that they offered to appear before the\ncourt below and to participate in the future proceedings.\n\nIn the result, Crl.M.C is disposed of directing the\npetitioners herein to appear before the jurisdictional court within\nten days from today and to seek bail. In the event of any application\nfor bail being filed, court below shall take it up on the same day\nitself and pass appropriate orders in the light of what is stated\nabove. Warrant issued by the court below will be kept in abeyance\ntill the appearance of the petitioners within the above stipulated\nperiod.\n\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS\nJudge\nSbna/5/1/17\nTrue Copy /\nP A to Judge\n\n"
