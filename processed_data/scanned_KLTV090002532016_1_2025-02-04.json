This is a case instituted upon the Final report filed by Sub Inspector of\nPolice, City Traffic Police Station in Crime No. 5085 of 2013 for the offences\npunishable under Sections 279, 337, 304A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860\n(hereinafter referred to as ‘the IPC’) r/w Section 134 (a) and (b) of the Motor\nVehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘MV Act’).\n2. The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: : The Accused herein,\narrayed as the 2? Accused in the Charge Sheet, is the driver of the TATA Ace van\nbearing registration No. KL 27 C 3093. It is alleged that the unidentified 1st\nAccused drove his unidentified car rashly, negligently and in a manner so as to\nendanger the human life through Venpalavattam- Kazhakkoottam by-pass road on\n24.08.2013 at 08:30 AM from south to North and hit on the backside of the\nmotorcycle bearing Registration No. KL 01 BL 8876 driven in the same direction\nby the since deceased along with CW2 as it's pillion rider, resulting in him to have\nlost his control over the said vehicle. And thereafter, the motor cycle got hit by the\nvan driven by the Accused herein from the opposite direction, rashly, negligently\nand in such a manner as to endanger the human life. The since deceased and CW2\nfell on road. Since deceased suffered serious injuries in his abdomen etc., and CW2\nalso sustained injuries. The Ist Accused went away in his vehicle without providing\nnecessary medical aid and giving intimation to the police officials. The Accused\nherein took them to the hospital along with CW6 and the since deceased\n\n3\nsuccumbed to his injuries while undergoing treatment. Thus the Accused herein is\nalleged to have committed the above said offences.\n3. This Court took cognizance on the basis of the Final Report in respect of\noffences under Sections 279, 337, 304A of the IPC r/w 134(a) and (b) of Motor\nVehicle Act. On issuance of process, the Accused herein entered appearance. He\nwas enlarged on bail. He was represented by a Counsel of his own choice. Copies\nof all relevant Prosecution records were furnished to him. The particulars of the\noffences under Sections 279, 337, 304A of the IPC r/w 134(a) and (b) of Motor\nVehicle Act were read over and explained to him, to which he pleaded not guilty,\nand claimed to be tried.\n4. From the side of Prosecution, CWs 1 to 4, 21 to 23 were examined as PWs 1\nto 7 and Exhibits P1 to P7 marked. Exhibits P8 to P15 were marked subject to\nproof. The presence of CW5 and 7 could not be procured by the Prosecution and\nSection 82 steps effected against CW5 and report filed to the effect that presence\nof CW7 cannot be procured in the near future.. The remaining witnesses were\ngiven up by the Learned APP as the material witnesses turned hostile to the case of\nProsecution. The Accused denied all the incriminating circumstances agianst him\non his examination under Section 313(1)(b) of the CrPC. No Defence evidence was\nadduced.\n5. Heard both sides and perused relevant documents. The following points\narise for consideration.\na. Has the Accused driven the aforesaid vehicle rashly, negligently in a\nmanner endangering the life of injured causing injury to him and thereby\ncommitted the offence punishable under Section 279 of the IPC as alleged?\nb. Has the Accused driven the aforesaid vehicle and rashly, negligently\nin a manner endangering the life and personal safety of the injured, causing\nthem hurt and thereby committed the offence punishable under Section 337\nIPC as alleged?\n\nA\n\nCc. Has the accused failed to provide primary medical aid to the injured\n\nas well as failed to inform the police, and thereby commit the offence\n\npunishable 134 (a) and (b) of Motor Vehicles Act?\n\nd. If so, the proper sentence to be awarded?\n\n6. Points (a) to (c): These points are considered together for the sake of\nbrevity and to avoid repetition.\n\nPW1 deposed that since deceased is his niece and he got information about\nthe incident over phone and visited him at Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram.\nHe gave Exhibit P1 statement to the police.\n\nPW2 deposed that he has no previous acquaintance with the since deceased\nand that during 2013, at 08:00AM while he was travelling in scooter from\nKumarapuram to Kazhakkoottam, his scooter was overtaken by a car at Injakkal\nhighway and hit on the bike in front of him and went ahead without stopping the\nvehicle. Teh person who had driven the bike fell on the right side of the road and\nhe was hit by a vehicle like a van and sustained injuries. He was taken to the\nhospital in a car. There were two persons in the bike and he doesn’t know the\nreason for the accident. He deposed that neither ke knows the numbers of those\ncar and can, nor the drivers. He denied of having given statement to the police to\nthe effect that it was on account of the negligence of the vehicles that the accident\ntook place.\n\nPWs3 and 4, the occurrence witnesses denied having witnessed the incident\nand also having given statement to the police to that effect.\n\nPW5 deposed that he registered the Exhibit P2 FIR. He further deposed that\nCW2 also got injured in the incident. He admitted during his cross-examination\nthat nothing is reflected on the records to the effect that Tata Ace Goods vehicle is\nhaving any connection with the alleged accident. PW6 is the Investigating Officer\nand he deposed that he prepared Exhibit P3 Inquest Report and Exhibit P3 Scene\n\n5\n\nMahazar. He also admitted that during the Inquest no witnesses present therein\nstated to the effect that Tata Ace Goods vehicle is having any connection with the\nalleged accident. PW7 is the officer who took over the Investigation. He deposed\nthat he gave Exhibit P5 notice to the Accused for production of the latter’s vehicle\nto which Exhibit P5(a) reply was given. He deposed that he recorded the arrest of\nthe Accused and enlarged him on Exhibit P6 Bail Bond and that Exhibit P7 is the\nAddress Report prepared by him. He prepared Exhibit P8 Vehicle Mahazar and\nExhibits P9 and P10 are the Inspection Reports of the Motor Vehicles Inspector.\nExhibits P11 and 12 are Third Party Bail Bonds. Exhibits P13 to P15 are the Scene\nPlan, Wound Certificate and the Post Mortem Certificate respectively. He deposed\nthat the 1st Accused and the car could not be identified during the investigation.\nHe admitted the same during the Cross-Examination as well.\n\nOn going through the evidence and the materials on record, it is pertinent to\nnote that none of the occurrence witnesses have identified either the Accused or\nhis vehicle. The officials who have investigated the alleged offence admitted the\nfact that the vehicle belonging to the Accused in fact have no connection with the\nalleged crime. Although PW7 denied it, he admits not to have found the car that\nhad allegedly hit the bike or it's owner. PW3 the alleged injured himself turned\nagainst the case of Prosecution by his denial as regards injuries sustained and the\nincident itself. PW2 also is not sure about the other vehicle that had hit the bike\nnor could identify the Accused. Nothing has come out in evidence to the effect that\nit was on account of the rashness or negligence of this Accused that the alleged\naccident occured. Hence the ingredients of the offences under Sections 279, 337\nand 304 A of the IPC doesn't stand proved against the Accused herein.\nInterestingly, even according to the Prosecution, the injured were taken to the\nhospital in the vehicle of the Accused herein, as reflected in the Charge Sheet.\nHence the offences under Sections 134(a) and (b) of the MV Act also does not\nstand proved against the Accused herein, for the twin reasons that; firstly, there is\nno evidence forthcoming to the effect that it was the rash or negligent driving of\nthe vehicle of the Accused that had resulted in the accident and secondly, that it\n\n6\nwas in his vehicle that the injured were taken to the hospital even according to the\nversion of the Prosecution.\n\nThe Prosecution has thus failed to substantiate its case by adducing proper\nevidence and thereby failed to prove the guilt of the Accused beyond reasonable\ndoubt, much less rash or negligent driving against him. Hence these points are\nfound in favour of the Accused.\n\n9. Point d: In light of analysis of the points hereinabove, since those are found\nin favour of the Accused, no sentence is to be awarded to the Accused.\n10. In the result, the Accused is found not guilty of having committed the\noffence punishable under Sections 279, 337, 304 A of the IPC and 134 (a) and (b)\nof the MV Act. Hence, the Accused is acquitted of the said offences under section\n255(1) of CrPC. His bail bond stands canceled and he is set at liberty.\n(Dictated to my Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected by\nme and pronounced in open court on this the 4\" day of February, 2025)\nJudicial Magistrate of First Class-I\nThiruvananthapuram\nAPPENDIX\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA: Prosecution witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nWilson(CW1) examined\n\n7\nPW2 Krishnan(CW3) examined | Occurrence witness\non 14.03.2017\nPW3 Babu M K(CW2) Occurrence witness\nexamined on 11.02.2021\nPW4 Herick Norvert examined | Occurrence witness\non 10.01.2022\nPW5 Manikantan Nair Police witness\nR(CW21) examined on\n09.01.2025\nPW6 N Anil Kumar(CW22) Police witness\nexamined on 09.01.2025\nPW7 O A Sunil(CW23) Police witness\nexamined on 16.01.2025\nB: Defence witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nC: Court witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\n\n8\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA.
