No.\n383/2014 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,\nKasaragod. The offences alleged against the petitioners are\npunishable under Sections 143,147,148,324,283 and 308 read with\nSection 149 of the Indian Penal Code. The grievance of the\npetitioners is that, the Magistrate Court has already issued non-\nbailable warrant against them and if they surrender before the\nMagistrate Court there is every likelihood of the applications not\nbeing considered on the very same day. Therefore, the petitioners\nseek a direction to consider their bail applications on the day of\nsurrender itself.\n2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the\nlearned Public Prosecutor.\n3. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, this\nCrIl.M.C. is disposed of directing the petitioners to surrender before\n\nPa\n\nBee\nCrl.M.C.No. 2585 of 2015 2 EEE\nthe Magistrate Court within a period of two weeks from today and the\nMagistrate Court is further directed to consider their bail applications\non the day of surrender itself, strictly in accordance with law. The\nnon-bailable warrant already issued against the petitioners shall be\nkept in abeyance for a period of two weeks.\n\nThe Crl.M.C. is disposed of as above.\nANIL K.NARENDRAN,\nJUDGE\n\nDCS\n\n"
