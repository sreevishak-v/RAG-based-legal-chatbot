The case of the petitioner in the petition was that, the\npetitioner has married the second respondent and they lived as\nhusband and wife for sometime. At the time of marriage, 100\nsovereigns of gold ornaments, a car and some cash were given.\nDue to some mis-understanding between the parties, they started\nliving separately, which lead to the filing of a private complaint by\n\nae\n2015/KER/17314\n\nCrl.M.C.1142/2015 2\n\nsecond respondent, against the petitioner and his relatives, alleging\noffence under Section 498A read with Section 34 of Indian Penal\nCode, which was forwarded to the police by the learned Magistrate\nfor an investigation under Section 156(3) of the Code and\nAnnexure-1, First Information Report was registered as Crime\nNo.773 of 2013 of Managalapuram police station, against the\npetitioner and others alleging offence under Section 498A read\nwith Section 34 of Indian Penal Code. After investigation,\nAnnexure-2 Final Report (wrongly shown as Annexure-I in the\npetition) was filed against the petitioner alone, alleging offence\nunder Section 498A and it was taken on file as C.C. No.1338/2014\non the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-II, Attingal.\nThe matter has been settled between the parties and they have\ndecided to separate and they filed a joint petition for divorce and\nthat is pending. In view of the settlement, the second respondent is\nnot interested in further prosecuting the petitioner. Since it is a\nnon-compoundable offence, they cannot file application before the\n\nBee\n2015/KER/17314\nCri.M.C.1142/2015 3\ncourt below. No purpose will be served by proceedings against\nthe petitioner as well, and as no conviction is possible in this case.\nSo the petitioner has no other remedy except to approach this court\nfor the following relief:\n“to quash all further proceedings in Annexure-1 final report\n\nin crime No.773/2013 of the Mangalapuram police station, which\n\nis now pending as C.C. No.1339/2014 before Judicial First Class\n\nMagistrate's Court-II, Attingal against the petitioner and further\n\nproceedings thereto”\n\n3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, learned\ncounsel for the second respondent and the learned Public\nProsecutor.\n\n4. The learned counsel for second respondent submitted that\nthe matter has been settled between the parties and they have\ndecided to separate and a decision was taken in the mediation held\nat the intervention of mediators and well wishers and they have\nfiled an application for divorce. The second respondent did not\nwant to prosecute the case in view of the settlement. Anexure - 2\n\nPact\n2015/KER/17314\n\nCrl.M.C.1142/2015 4\n\naffidavit has also been filed by second respondent stating these\nfacts. (It must be Annexure-3 as final report was marked as\nAmnexure-2 by this court). The learned counsel for the petitioner\nsubmitted that in view of the settlement, no purpose will be served\n\nby proceeding with the case and he prayed for allowing the\napplication. Public Prosecutor opposed the application.\n\n5. It is an admitted fact that the petitioner married the second\nrespondent and they were living together as husband and wife for\nsometime. Due to some mis-understanding, they started living\nseparately, which lead to the filing of a private complaint before\nthe Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-II, Attingal by the\nsecond respondent, alleging offence under Section 498A read with\nSection 34 of Indian Penal Code against the petitioner and his\nrelatives on the basis of which Annexure-1 crime was registered as\ncrime No.773/2013 of Managalapuram police station, alleging\noffence under Section 498A read with Section 34 of Indian Penal\nCode. After investigation, Annexure-2 final report was filed\n\nae\n2015/KER/17314\n\nCrl.M.C.1142/2015 5\n\n(wrongly shown as Annexure-1 in the petition) against the\npetitioner alone, for the offence under Section 498A and the case\n\nwas taken on file as C.C. No.1338 of 2014 on the file of the\nJudicial First Class Magistrate's Court-II, Attingal, where it is now\npending.\n\n6. In the meantime, due to the intervention of some\nmediators and well wishers of both the parties, the matter has been\nsettled between the parties and they have decided to separate by\nfiling an application for divorce, by mutual consent and\naccordingly, O.P(HMA) No.1091 of 2014 was filed before the\nFamily Court, Attingal and that is pending. In view of the\nsettlement, now the second respondent does not want to prosecute\nthe petitioner, who is her husband.\n\n7. In view of the settlement, even if the case is directed to be\ntried, there is no possibility of conviction, as the witnesses\nincluding the defacto complainant will not support the case of\nprosecution. Further, in the decision reported in Gian Singh v.\n\nBgitah\n2015/KER/17314\n\nCrl.M.C.1142/2015 6\n\nState of Punjab [2012(4) KLT 108], the honourable Supreme\nCourt has held that in appropriate cases where only private\ndisputes are involved and in cases of matrimonial matters, where\nrelatives are involved and the mater has been settled between the\nparties, though some non-compoundable offences are incorporated,\n\nin order to bring harmony between the family members, the court\nhas to invoke power under Section 482 of the Code to quash the\nproceedings, in such cases. This was followed in the subsequent\ndecisions of the Supreme Court as well.\n\n8. In view of the dictum laid down in the above decision and\nalso by considering the fact that this is a family dispute, which\nresulted in registration of crime and filing of the final report and\nalso considering the fact that the matter has been settled between\nthe parties due to the intervention mediators and well wishers and\nfiled petition for divorce by mutual consent and proceeding with\nthe case will cause only waste of judicial time, as conviction is not\npossible, this court feels that it is a fit case where the power under\n\nPact\npants\nBee\n2015/KER/17314\nCrl.M.C.1142/2015 7\nSection 482 of the code has to be invoked to quash the proceedings\nto honour the settlement in order to bring harmony between the\nfamily members and the pendency of the proceedings will not be a\nhurdle to the same.\n\nThe Crl.M.C. is allowed and further proceedings in C.C.\n1338 of 2014 (Crime No.773 of 2013 of Managalapuram police\nstation) now pending before before Judicial First Class\nMagistrate's Court - II, Attingal, as against the petitioner is\nquashed",
