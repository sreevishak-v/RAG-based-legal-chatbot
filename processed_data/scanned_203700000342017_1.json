No.34 of 2017\nDated this the 4\" day of January, 2017\nORDER\n\n1.This petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure.\n\n2. The petitioner is the accused in Crime No.771 of 2016 of\nRamamangalam Police Station registered on the basis of\ninformation furnished by the 2™ respondent, a minor girl,\naged 16 years, alleging commission of offence under\nSections 7 and 8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual\nOffences Act, 2012.\n\n3.The petitioner is a Post Graduate student at M.A.College,\nKothamangalam. He used to work as a swimming\ninstructor at the MTMHS College, Piravom. The 2™4\nrespondent was a student studying for the plus two course\n\n2017/KER/228\n\nCril.M.C.34/2017 2\nin the said college. The prosecution allegation is that the\npetitioner took the 2™ respondent to Piravom park and\nalso to Issac Theatre, Muvattupuzha and committed\nsexual assault.\n\n4.The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits\nthat the crime was registered on account of some\nmisconception and after the registration of the crime, the\nparties have sat together and have settled the disputes\namicably. Reference is also made to Annexure-A3\naffidavit signed by the 3™ respondent , who is the mother\nof the 2\"? respondent, to bring home the point that the\nminor child or the mother has any grievance against the\naccused.\n\n5.The learned Public Prosecutor would vehemently oppose\nthe submission of the learned counsel and submit that the\noffence is grave and it will not be in the interest of justice\nto quash the proceedings on a purported settlement with\nthe mother of the minor girl.\n\n2017/KER/228\n\nCril.M.C.34/2017 3\n\n6.[ have considered the rival submissions and have\nanxiously perused the records .\n\n7.Act 32 of 2012 was enacted to prevent the increasing\nnumber of sexual offences against children and to give\nadequate punishment to the offenders and to protect the\nright of the children guaranteed by the U.N. Convention\non Right of Child , 1989 and the Constitution of India. The\n2™ respondent was aged 16 years at the relevant point of\ntime and the allegation would prima facie disclose a case\nof sexual assault. The offence committed by the accused is\nan offence against the society and it is not a matter to be\nleft for the parties to compromise and settle. As the victim\nwas a minor girl, this Court cannot be assured that the\nconsent given is genuine. In cases such as this, the\naccused will utilize all the resources at his command to\npressurize the family members for a compromise. The\noffence is grave and in that view of the matter, I am\nunable to accept the compromise arrived at to quash the\n\nBel\napa\n2017/KER/228\nCril.M.C.34/2017 4\nproceedings.\n8.It appears from the case diary that the Investigating\nofficer has not so far taken steps to record the statement\nof the child by a Magistrate. The crime was registered on\n6.8.2016, and the delay that has occasioned cannot be\ncountenanced. The officer concerned is directed to\nexpedite the proceedings and to submit the final report\nbefore Court.\n9.I find no merit in this petition and the same will stand\ndismissed .\nSd/-\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN, V.\nJUDGE\nPs/4/1/17\n\n"
