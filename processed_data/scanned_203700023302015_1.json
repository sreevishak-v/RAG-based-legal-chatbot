The learned counsel for the petitioners urged\nfor quashing all criminal proceedings against the\npetitioners under Annexure-A final report invoking\nthe jurisdiction and inherent power under Section 482\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure. The learned\ncounsel further cited the decision reported in Gian\nSingh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)].

In the above case, three Judge Bench of the\nApex Court, on a reference, considered the question\nwhether the High Court has power to quash criminal\nproceedings involving non-compoundable offences on\nthe basis of the compromise reached between the\noffender and the victim and answered as given below:\n“57. The position that emerges from the\nabove discussion can be summarised thus:\nthe power of the High Court in quashing a\ncriminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in\nexercise of its inherent jurisdiction is\ndistinct and different from the power given\nto a criminal court for compounding the\noffences under S.320 of the Code.

In what cases power to quash the\ncriminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.\nmay be exercised where the offender and\nvictim have settled their dispute would\ndepend on the facts and circumstances of\neach case and no category can be prescribed.\nHowever, before exercise of such power, the\nHigh Court must have due regard to the\nnature and gravity of the crime.

I have meticulously considered the decision\n\nrN\n2015/KER/17258\nCrl.M.C.2330/15-B 23:\nlaid down in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT\n108 (SC)]. In the above case, three Judge Bench of the\nApex Court, on a reference, considered the question\nwhether the High Court has power to quash criminal\nproceedings involving non-compoundable offences on\nthe basis of the compromise reached between the\noffender and the victim and answered as given below:\n“57. The position that emerges from the\nabove discussion can be summarised thus:\nthe power of the High Court in quashing a\ncriminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in\nexercise of its inherent jurisdiction is\ndistinct and different from the power given\nto a criminal court for compounding the\noffences under S.320 of the Code. Inherent\npower is of wide plenitude with no statutory\nlimitation but it has to be exercised in\naccord with the guideline engrafted in such\npower viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or\n(ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any\nCourt. In what cases power to quash the\ncriminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.\nmay be exercised where the offender and\nvictim have settled their dispute would\ndepend on the facts and circumstances of\neach case and no category can be prescribed.\nHowever, before exercise of such power, the\nHigh Court must have due regard to the\nnature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and\nserious offences of mental depravity or\noffences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc.,\ncannot be fittingly quashed even though the\nvictim or victim's family and the offender\n\nBE\n2015/KER/17258\nCrl.M.C.2330/15-B 24:\nhave settled the dispute. Such offences are\nnot private in nature and have serious\nimpact on society. Similarly, any\ncompromise between the victim and offender\nin relation to the offences under special\nstatutes like Prevention of Corruption Act\nor the offences committed by public\nservants while working in that capacity etc:\ncannot provide for any basis for quashing\ncriminal proceedings involving such\noffences. But the criminal cases having\noverwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil\nflavour stand on different footing for the\npurposes of quashing, particularly the\noffences arising from commercial, financial,\nmercantile, civil, partnership or such like\ntransactions or the offences arising out of\nmatrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the\nfamily disputes where the wrong is basically\nprivate or personal in nature and the parties\nhave resolved their entire dispute. In this\ncategory of cases, High Court may quash\ncriminal proceedings if in its view, because\nof the compromise between the offender and\nvictim, the possibility of conviction is\nremote, bleak and continuation of criminal\ncase would put accused to great oppression\nand prejudice and extreme injustice would be\ncaused to him by not quashing the criminal\ncase despite full and complete settlement\nand compromise with the victim. In other\nwords, the High Court must consider whether\nit would be unfair or contrary to the\ninterest of justice to continue with the\ncriminal proceeding or continuation of the\ncriminal proceeding would tantamount to\nabuse of process of law despite settlement\nand compromise between the victim and\nwrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of\njustice, it is appropriate that criminal case\nis put to an end and if the answer to the\nabove question(s) is in affirmative, the High\n\nBn\n2015/KER/17258\nCrl.M.C.2330/15-B 5:\nCourt shall be well within its jurisdiction to\nquash the criminal proceeding.”\n\n5. In view of the proposition laid down above, the\nquestion to be considered, in the instant case, is,\nwhether the non-compoundable offence involved in\nthis case can be compounded, in the exercise of the\ninherent power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. Prima\nfacie, I find that the offences alleged against the\npetitioners will not come under the category of non-\ncompoundable offences, which are _ specifically\nexcluded from composition, in the exercise of\ninherent power under Sec.482 of the Cr.P.C. Going by\nthe affidavit filed by the de facto complainant, it is\nseen that the dispute between the accused and the\nvictim had been amicably settled and at present the\nde facto complainant has no subsisting grievance at\nall. The de facto complainant does not want to\nproceed with prosecution against the accused. Full\nand final settlement and compromise with the victim\nare evidenced by the affidavit filed by the first\n\nDire)\n2015/KER/17258\n\nCrl.M.C.2330/15-B :6:\n\nrespondent. In view of the compromise between the\npetitioners and the victim, I find that the possibility\n\nof conviction is remote, bleak, and continuation of\nthe criminal case would put the parties to great\noppression, prejudice and also tantamount to abuse of\nthe process of the court. The present criminal\nprosecution against the accused must be put to an end\n\nto secure the interest of justice.\n\n6. In this analysis, the prosecution proceedings\nagainst the petitioners under Annexure-Al final\nreport will stand quashed in the exercise of\njurisdiction and power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.\n\nThis petition is allowed.\n\nSd/-\n(K.HARILAL, JUDGE)\nokb.\n\n"
