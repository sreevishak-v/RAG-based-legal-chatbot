The\nlearned Sessions Judge in the impugned order stated\nthat the Passport cannot be returned because the\npetitioner is only intending to apply for a Visa for\ngoing abroad in search for job which does not appear\nto be compelling on facts in view of the fact that he\nhas not secured a job abroad yet, therefore the\nprayer for release of the Passport cannot be allowed.\n\nThe petitioner is a Diploma holder in Electrical\nEngineering and wants to apply for a job abroad, for\nwhich he has to apply for Visa. It is common\nknowledge that without a Passport and Visa, he will\nnot be able to go abroad. For applying for a job, he\n\nCrl1.M.C.No.8851 of 2019 3 2020/KER/833\nhas to produce his Passport and also to apply for\nVisa, the Passport is essential. The case is of the\nyear 2019. There is no possibility of it being taken\nup immediately. The petitioner does not have any\nother criminal antecedents.\n\nUnder the above circumstances, I am inclined to\nallow this Crl.M.C. and the Passport of the\npetitioner shall be released to him for applying for\na job and Visa, after retraining a certified copy of\nthe Passport. However, it is made clear that before\ngoing abroad, the petitioner shall again seek\npermission of the Court below and it is only subject\nto the such permission that he shall be allowed to go\nabroad.\n\nSd/-\ndkr ASHOK MENON\nJUDGE\n\nPIR)\nsenna\nBle\nCri.M.C.No.8851 of 2019 2020/KER/833\n4\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE Al COPY OF THE ORDER IN CRL.MC NO.4344/2019 oF\nTHE HIGH COURT.\nANNEXURE A2 COPY OF THE ORDER IN CRL.MP NO.512/2019 OF\nADDITIONAL SESSIONS JUDGE-II, MAVELIKARA.\nANNEXURE A3 COPY OF THE ORDER IN CRL.MC 2416/2018 OF\nHIGH COURT OF KERALA.\n\n"
