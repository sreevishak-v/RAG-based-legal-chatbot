According to the prosecution, on 26.02.2023, the accused\ntrespassed into the residence of the defacto complainant and destroyed\nthe window panes and the door of his house and in that process the\ndefacto complainant suffered injuries and thereby the accused committed\nthe offences alleged.\n\n3. Sri. Gautham Krishna E J, the learned counsel for the petitioner\ncontended that the entire prosecution allegations are false and the crime\nhas been registered as a counter blast to Crime No.123/2023 before the\nsame police station, wherein the defacto complainant’s son had\ntrespassed into the house of the accused herein and caused damages and\ncommitted offences under Section 427 and 448 of the Indian Penal Code,\n1860. It was further submitted that the allegations in Crime No. 125/2023\nare patently false and maliciously instituted. According to the learned\n\n2024/KER/4681\nCrl.M.C.No.230 of 2024 ;\ncounsel, the circumstances warrant invocation of the inherent jurisdiction\nunder Section 482 Cr.P.C to quash the proceedings.\n\n4. Smt. Sreeja. V, the learned Public Prosecutor opposed the\napplication and submitted that the crime is only at the investigation stage\nand therefore, the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C ought not to be\ninvoked.\n\n5. From the contentions advanced by the learned counsel for the\npetitioner, it is evident that Crime No.123/2023 and Crime No.125/2023\ncould be treated as case and counter case. However, this Court cannot, at\nthis stage of the proceedings, arrive at a conclusion as to whether the\nallegations are false or not.\n\n6. Further the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C can be invoked\nto quash an FIR only in exceptional circumstances. No such exceptional\ncircumstances are brought out, despite the vehement contentions raised\nby the learned counsel for the petitioner.\n\nHence, there is no merit in this criminal miscellaneous case and it is\ndismissed.\n\nSd/-\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\nJka/22.01.24.\n\nESE\nEee\n2024/KER/4681\nCrl.M.C.No.230 of 2024\na4:-\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 230/2024\nPETITIONER’S ANNEXURES\nAnnexure A THE TRUE COPY OF FIR NO.0125/2023 OF\nVELLIKULANGARA POLICE STATION, THRISSUR.\nAnnexure B TRUE COPY OF THE FIR NO. 0123/2023 OF\nVELLIKULANGARA POLICE STATION, THRISSUR.\n\n"
