He is charged with an\noffence punishable under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments\nAct. The case in the complaint is that the petitioner/accused\nborrowed money from the complainant and issued the disputed\ncheque in discharge of that liability. When the cheque was presented\nfor collection, it was dishonoured due to insufficiency of funds.\nAfter sending statutory notice, the complaint was filed before the\ncourt below. Learned counsel for the petitioner drew attention of this\ncourt to Annexure A, the reply notice, wherein a specific dispute\nregarding lack of any previous acquaintance between the\ncomplainant and the accused was raised. According to the petitioner\nthere was no dealing between the complainant and the accused.\nAnnexure B is the copy of the deposition of PW1, who is the\ncomplainant. At the time of cross examination, specific questions\nwere put regardingly the identity of the accused as he was not\n\nces\nCrl.M.C.No.1368 of 2012 2\n2014/KER/52\npresent in court at the time of cross examination. It is seen from\nAnnexure B that two photographs were shown to the complainant\nduring cross examination and initially he failed to identify the\naccused from among the persons seen on the photographs. Learned\ncounsel for the petitioner submitted that the cross examination could\nnot be completed during the morning session and it was deferred\nafter lunch. Thereafter, the witness was further cross examined and\nin re-examination the complainant hesitantly identified the accused\nfrom one of the photographs. Therefore, the petitioner produced\nAnnexure C petition under Section 311 Cr.P.C. Learned Magistrate\npassed an order in that matter which is Annexure E. Petitioner is\naggrieved by the directions passed by the Magistrate in Annexure E\nthat the accused shall be present on the next hearing date during the\nfurther examination of the complainant. According to the learned\ncounsel for the petitioner this is a case wherein any previous\nacquaintance between the complainant and the accused is disputed.\nIt will cause prejudice to the accused if he is directed to appear when\nthe complainant is called for further examination.\n\nRene\nCrl.M.C.No.1368 of 2012 3 iaveaas\n2014/KER/52\n2. Heard the learned counsel for the complainant/\nrespondent. According to the learned counsel for the complainant,\nthe accused was last seen by the complainant in 2007 and that is why\nhe could not properly identify the accused when examined on\n2-2-2010. However, considering the defence taken in this matter, I\nfind that the Magistrate ought not have directed the\npetitioner/accused to appear at the time when the complainant is\nexamined, considering the peculiar nature of the case. It is for the\ncomplainant to discharge his duty of establishing the identity of the\naccused, especially when there is a challenge regarding any\ntransaction and previous acquaintance. Therefore, that part of the\nimpugned order directing the accused to appear before the trial court\nat the time of further examination of the complainant is set aside. To\nthis extent this petition is allowed.\nAll interlocutory applications will stand dismissed.\nSd/-\nA.HARIPRASAD,\nJUDGE.\n//True Copy//\nP.Ato Judge\namk\n\n"
