KEMAL PASHA, J.\n~â€”CrLM.C.No.6428 of 2014\nDated this the 6\" day of December, 2017\nORDER\n\nAnnexure-Al1 complaint in respect of C.C.No.615/2014\nof the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-II,\nThamarassery, is under challenge. The petitioner is the\naccused before the court below, against whom cognizance\nhas been taken by the court below for the offences\npunishable under Sections 342, 352, 323 and 324 IPC and\nSection 116(C) of the Kerala Police Act.\n\n2.  Itis alleged that the complainant was called to the\nPolice Station under the guise of recording his statement,\nand there he was tortured and harassed. Of course, it is a\nmatter to be proved through evidence.\n\n3. According to the learned counsel for the petitioner,\nthis is a case wherein sanction under Section 197 CrP.C.\nought to have been obtained for taking cognizance of the\noffences against the petitioner. The learned counsel for the\npetitioner has relied on the decision in Devinder Singh and\n\nmeee\n2017/KER/49301\n\nCrl.M.C. No.6428 of 2014 ;\n\nothers v. State of Punjab [(2016)12 SCC 87] wherein\nspecific guidelines have been given by the Apex Court\nregarding the cases in which Section 197 CrP.C. has\napplication. On going through the said guidelines, presently\n\nit cannot be said that this is a case wherein sanction ought to\n\nhave been obtained. It has to be established during trial.\n\n4. It is true that as per the decision in Devinder\nSingh (supra), question of sanction may arise at any stage\nof the proceedings. Normally, such question of sanction has\nto be considered at the pre-cognizance stage, and if sanction\nis found to be necessary, the courts do not take cognizance\nof the offences until order of sanction has been produced.\nThat is not the end of the matter Question of sanction can\nbe raised at the time of framing of charges also, in case it is\nfound that sanction is required, courts do not frame charges\nuntil sanction is produced. That is also not the end of the\nroad.\n\n5. Even during trial, the said question can be raised;\nbut at that stage i.e., after the framing of charges, the\naccused cannot seek a discharge on the ground of want of\n\nmeee\n2017/KER/49301\n\nCrl.M.C. No.6428 of 2014 ;\n\nsanction. At that stage, the accused can move only for\ncanvassing an acquittal. In case the court feels that sanction\n\nis required and it has come out through evidence during trial\n\nthat sanction is required, the court below can acquit the\naccused on the ground of want of sanction after dispensing\n\nwith the examination of the remaining witnesses. That is\n\nalso possible.\n\nWith liberty to the petitioner to have recourse to such\nsteps, and with liberty to take up the very same contentions\nduring any such stage as noted above before the court below,\nthis Crl.M.C. is disposed of.\n\nSd/-\nB. KEMAL PASHA, JUDGE.\nsd\n// True Copy // P.A. to Judge\n\n"
