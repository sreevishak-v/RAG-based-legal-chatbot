CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON\n04.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nCrl.MC.No.5243 OF 2020 (8) 202 1/KER/83\n2\nORDER\n\nThe accused No.2 came up against the Annexure\nA4 order passed under Section 451 Cr.P.C partly\nallowing release of certain articles seized from\nher. The gold ornaments and the cash comes to\nRs.1,08,940/- (Rupees one lakh eight thousand nine\nhundred and forty only) were not released by the\nlearned Magistrate. Aggrieved by the said order,\naccused No.2 came up under Section 482 Cr.P.C.\n\n2. The allegation levelled against both the\naccused Nos. 1 and 2 prima facie appears to be very\nserious as there is involvement of seventeen\npersons and an amount of Rs.39,00,000/- (Rupees\nthirty nine lakhs only) received under the guise of\npromise to sell the property owned by somebody\nelse. It is submitted that, accused No.1 in fact\nis doing a business of real estate, for which, he\nused to enter into agreement with owners of the\nproperty, but no such agreement is produced.\nAccused No.2 is a lady. The allegation levelled\n\nCrl.MC.No.5243 OF 2020 (8) 2021/KERI83\n3\nagainst accused No.2 is that, she is also a\nparticipant, and received the amount on various\noccasions under the guise of promise to give the\nproperty. An order passed under Section 451 Cr.P.C\nis an interim order and always would stand subject\nto an order, that may be passed under Section 452\nCr.P.C. Certain articles were released by the\nlearned Magistrate and some other articles which\nincludes gold ornaments and the amount retained on\nsufficient reason. As such, there is no ground for\nexhausting the inherent power under Section 482\nCr.P.C.\nThe Crl1.M.C. is hereby dismissed.\nSd/-\nP.
