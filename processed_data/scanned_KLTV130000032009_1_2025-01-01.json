PW25 in his cross examination denied the statement before the police .He\nidentified accused no.2 who is standing in the dock as accused no.1\nSahrafudeen .\n\n43.PW 31 Sobhana in the cross examination stated that the chitty business was run\nby Sharahudeen who is standing in the dock,whereas the accused no.2 was\npresent .According to her she gave a written complaint to the police which was\nnot produced by the prosecution .

An intention to deceive; and\niii. The person cheated must be dishonestly induced to\na. Deliver property to any person; or\nb. Make, alter or destroy valuable security or anything signed or sealed and\ncapable of being converted into valuable security.\n\n46. While analysing the oral evidence of witnesses ,it can be seen that there is no\ndirect evidence which shows that accused no.2 had run the chitty business and\nthe bank and collected money .The oral evidence confined to the accused no.1\nand not accused no.2 .Though PW163 states that accused no. and 2 were\nrunning the business ,he in the examination in chief it self stated that he has not\ncomplained to any authorities .He denied his statement before the police .when\nhe was asked about the role of accused no.2 in the cross examination he\nresponded that ‘ alao@] amos amog@mle! 25168 MI@éad Eso) o/s)\nANZA] B@ suMDvOJoe(Q ) @erloe (A) . According to him he posses no\ndocuments pertaining to the alleged transaction .The evidence of him when\nanalysed with other evidence cannot be relied Moreover the PW192 admitted\n\n14 of 23\nthat Ext P18,registration form does not contain the name of the accused\nno.2,i.e,in the registration form itself shows the name of accused no.1 and not\nthe accused no2 as its responsible person.\n\n47, Prosecution had not adduced any doment to show that the accused no.2 was\nauthorized foreman of the chitty fund institution or he has run the bank. As per\nExt. P19 the managing director of the said bank is accused no.1. There is no\ndirect evidence to show that the accused no2 received money and\nmisappropriated it .On analysing the oral as well as the documentary evidence\nadduced by the prosecution the role of accused no.2 cannot be said to have\nproved by the prosecution with respect to the offence w/s.420 IPC .\n\n48.The another allegation is that the accused has committed the offence u/s.17 of\nKerala Money Lenders Act 1958 .Section 17: Penalty for carrying on\nbusiness without licence or in violation of the conditions of licence.\n\n49. Whoever carries on the business of money lending without a licence or in\nviolation of the conditions of the licence or otherwise than in conformity with\nthe terms and conditions of the licence shall be punished with imprisonment\nfor a term which, in the absence of special reasons to be recorded in the\njudgement of the court, shall not be less than three months but which may\nextend to three years and with fine which may extend to fifty thousand\nrupees.”.]\n\n15 of 23\n\n50. The defence case is that the accused no.2 is a KSRTC employee .More over the\nprosecution has not adduced any evidence to prove that the accused no2 was\nrunning the business without any valid license .Ext P18 form issued in the\nname of accused no.1 .The Ext P7 rent deed was executed by accused no.1,\nExt. P19 issued by the district registrar in which the accused no.1 is the\nforeman,the Ext P18 Form A which shows that the firm was registered in the\nyear 1985,i.e before the death of P.K.Kunju . The details of partners after the\ndeath of him or after the reconstitution of the firm were not\nproduced .Furthermore there is no evidence to show that the accused no.2 was\nrunning the business . Hence it cannot be said that the accused no.2 without\nvalid license run the firm. The available evidence on record is hardly\nsufficient to find that the accused no.2 committed any offence u/s. 420 read\nwith 34 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 and 4(2) read with section 17 of Money\nLenders Act, 1958 as alleged by the prosecution beyond any reasonable doubt .\nFor said reasons point nos. 1 and 2 are found against the prosecution.\n\n51. Point No.3 :- Upon the finding in point nos. 1 and 2, accused No.2 is found\nnot guilty of offences punishable under sections 420 read with 34 of Indian\nPenal Code, 1860 and 4(2) read with section 17 of Money Lenders Act, 1958\nand he is acquitted of the said offences under section 248(1) of Code of\nCriminal Procedure, 1973. His bail bonds stand cancelled and he is set at\nliberty.
