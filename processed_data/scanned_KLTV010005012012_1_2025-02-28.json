He handed over the MOs recovered during the\npreparation of the inquest report to the Court via Ext. P7, the property\nlist. During his preliminary investigation, it was revealed that Sajeev was\nresponsible for Vinayan’s death. He stated during cross-examination that,\naccording to the inquest report, the deceased was last found alive with\nhis brother, Anil Kumar.\n\n24. CW19, who conducted the postmortem examination of the\ndeceased, Vinayan, is no longer alive. Hence, the prosecution examined\nDr. Sarija, who is familiar with the signature of CW19, as PW14. She\nstated that Ext. P8, the postmortem certificate, was issued by CW19, Dr.\nP. Rema, and it contained her signature and office seal.

He obtained custody\nof the accused from the Court, and the accused confessed that the\nchopper and iron bar used to commit the offence were given to accused\nNo.2. The shirt and dhoti worn by him at the time of the incident were\nkept at Pammankode Colony, and he would show them if he was brought\nthere. PW17 deposed that he arrived at a building situated on the\neastern side of a narrow passage leading from Pammankode Colony to\nMudapuram Kasaya Hospital, as guided by the accused. The accused\nentered the building and took the shirt and dhoti from over the kitchen\nslab. The dhoti and shirt were blood-stained, and he recovered them on\n25/06/2010 at 11:30 AM, as per Ext. P10, the recovery mahazar, in the\npresence of witnesses. Ext. P10(a) is the relevant portion of the\nconfession statement made by the accused, which was noted in Ext. P10\nrecovery mahazar. He identified the said dhoti and shirt as MO7 and\nMO8. These MOs were produced before the Court via Ext. Pil, the\nproperty list. Thereafter, he filed Ext. P12, a report showing the name\n\n15\n\nand full address of accused No.1. He also filed Ext. P13, a report showing\nthe date and time of the death of the deceased Vinayan. He filed Ext.\nP14, a report implicating accused No.2 and also continuing the\ninvestigation for the offences punishable under Sections 120B, 201, 302,\nand 34 of the IPC.\n\n29. On 27/08/2010, he arrested accused No.2 near the workshop\nlocated at Technopark, Kazhakuttom, and Exts. P15, P15(a), and P15(b)\nare the arrest documents. Accused No.2 confessed that the chopper and\niron bar were kept at a place in his house and he would show them if he\nwas brought there. He then proceeded there, as guided by accused No.2.\nAccused No.2 took the iron bar and chopper from behind the 6th\narecanut reaper of the thatched roof of the kitchen in his house. He\nrecovered them as per Ext. P4, the recovery mahazar. Ext. P4(a) is the\nrelevant portion of his confession statement noted in Ext. P4. PW17\nidentified MO5 and MO6 as the iron rod and chopper, respectively. He\nproduced them before the Court via Ext. P16, the property list. The Court\nreceived them as per T NO.437/2010. PW17 identified both the accused\nwhile they were in the dock. The MOs were forwarded for forensic\nexamination, and Ext. P17 is the forwarding note prepared by him for the\npurpose. After the examination, he received Ext. P18, the FSL report. As\nper this report, items Nos. 1 to 5, 8, and 9 contained human blood of\ngroup B. Item No.6 also contained blood, and item No.7 contained human\nhair.\n\n16\n\n30. During cross-examination, he stated that, on 13/05/2010, when the\nincident occurred, the deceased and his brother were the only ones\nstaying in the house. The body was found in the courtyard of the house.\nNo crime was pending against accused No.1 or the deceased in\nconnection with any scuffle between them. However, he acknowledged\nthat a scuffle had occurred between them. He denied the defence's\nallegation that Exts. P4(a) and P10(a) do not clearly disclose the exact\nplace where the MOs are alleged to have been hidden. He stated that he\nhad kept the MOs for the purpose of showing them to the doctor who\nconducted the postmortem examination. The MOs were entered in the\nproperty register of the Police Station. He denied the defence claim that\naccused No.1 did not visit the scene of the crime at the relevant time and\ndate.\n\n31. In this case, CW2 to CW5, CW12, CW14, CW15, CW18, and CW19\nwere not examined. CW2 to CW4, CW18, and CW19 are no longer alive.\nCW5 is in the Gulf. CW12 is bedridden. CW14 and CW15 were given up by\nthe prosecution.\n\n32. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor argued that the\nprosecution has succeeded in proving the charge against the accused by\nadducing reliable and convincing evidence. This is a case where direct\nevidence of the commission of the offence is not available; therefore, the\nprosecution is relying on circumstantial evidence against the accused\npersons. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor submitted that the\n\n17\n\nprosecution has adduced reliable evidence regarding the motive behind\nthe incident and the absconding of accused No. 1 immediately after the\nincident. The forensic evidence of the detection of the same human\nblood group in the MOs recovered from the body of the deceased at the\ntime of preparing the inquest report and from the clothes worn by\naccused No. 1 at the relevant time, which were recovered based on the\nconfession statement given by the accused, connects the accused with\nthe crime. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor further relied on the\nextra-judicial confession statement given by accused No. 1 to some of\nthe prosecution witnesses. He pointed out the statement made by\naccused No. 2, while being examined under Section 313 of the CrPC, that\naccused No. 1 took an iron bar from the construction site of his newly\nconstructed house, attacked the deceased with it, and then returned it to\nits place. Therefore, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor prays for the\nconviction of the accused on the charges leveled against them.\n\n33. The learned Deputy Chief Legal Aid Defence Counsel submitted that\nthe prosecution has miserably failed to prove the guilt of the accused. In\nthis regard, it was submitted that no proper investigation was conducted\nby the police. The prosecution has not proved the alleged motive against\nthe accused. The alleged motive may not be treated as grounds for\nmurdering a person. The evidence adduced by the prosecution does not\nalign with the charges leveled against the accused. The learned Deputy\nChief Legal Aid Defence Counsel further submitted that the alleged\n\n18\n\ndisclosure statement of the accused failed to specify the exact place\nwhere the weapons were allegedly concealed. Hence, the learned\nCounsel argued against the relevancy of the disclosure statement of the\naccused under Section 27 of the Evidence Act. The learned Deputy Chief\nLegal Aid Defence Counsel sought the acquittal of the accused.\n34. Inthe case at hand, there is no dispute regarding the fact that, the\ndeath of Vinayakumar was a homicide. The evidence tendered by PW14\nand Ext.P8, the postmortem certificate, indicate that the death was due\nto injuries sustained to head. There was no challenge to the opinion\ngiven by PW14, regarding the cause of death. As such, it can be safely\nconcluded that the prosecution has established the fact that the death of\nthe victim was a homicide.\n35. This is a case based on circumstantial evidence, and hence, the law\nstates that the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is drawn\nmust be fully proved, and such circumstances should be conclusive in na-\nture.\n36. In Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra (1984\nKHC 145), the Hon'ble Apex Court categorized five important conditions\nthat must be fulfilled before a case against an accused can be said to be\nfully established on circumstantial evidence. The conditions are:\n\n1.The circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn\n\nshould be fully established.\n\n19\n\n2.The facts so established should be consistent only with the hypoth-\nesis of the guilt of the accused; that is to say, they should not be\nexplainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is\nguilty.\n\n3. The circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency.\n\n4.They should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be\nproved.\n\n5. There must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any\nreasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the innocence of\nthe accused, and must show that, in all human probability, the act\nmust have been done by the accused.\n\n37. Now, the prosecution case must be considered. The circumstances\nand events upon which the prosecution relies to form a complete chain\ninclude the absconding of accused No. 1 after the commission of the\noffence, the motive of the accused, and the fact that the blood group\ndetected from the MOs, including the clothes recovered during the\npreparation of the inquest report of the deceased, was found to be the\nsame as the blood group detected from the clothes worn by accused No.\n1 at the relevant time, which were recovered based on the confession\nstatement of accused No.1. Another connecting link the prosecution\nrelied on is the extra-judicial confession statement of accused No. 1 to\nPW2 and PW9, as well as the evidence tendered by PW3 and PW/7,\ncorroborating the evidence provided by PW2 and PW8. Therefore, each\n\n20\n\npoint raised by the prosecution must be analyzed in light of the evidence\non record to assess the circumstantial evidence as claimed by the\nprosecution.\n\n38. First of all, the evidence regarding the recovery of MO7 and MO8\n(item Nos. 8 and 9 in Ext.P18) must be analyzed. It is a well established\nprinciple of law that, in order to make a disclosure statement relevant\nUnder Section 27 of the Evidence Act, there must be subsequent confir-\nmation. Here, the evidence tendered by PW17 indicates that based on\nthe confession statement given by accused No.1, he arrived at a building\nsituated on the eastern side of a narrow passage, leading from Pam-\nmankode Colony to Mudapuram Kasaya Hospital, as guided by accused\nNo.1. Accused No. 1, then entered the building and took a shirt and dhoti\nfrom over the kitchen slab. PW17 testified that the dhoti and shirt were\nblood stained. He recovered them as per Ext.P10, the recovery mahazar.\nIt is well settled that the evidence of a police officer cannot be discarded\nsolely on the ground that he belongs to the police force, but his evidence\nmust be considered as the evidence of any other witness. | do not find\nany reason to believe that PW17 falsely implicated accused No.1 in this\ncase. The defence has not claimed that PW17, the police officer, has any\npersonal rivalry with accused No. 1. | am of the opinion that, the\nevidence tendered by PW17 well establishes the recovery of MO7 and\nMO8, i.e., item Nos. 8 and 9 in the Ext. P18 report.\n\n21\n39. In this context, | placed reliance on the decision reported in State\nof Maharashtra v. Suresh (2000 (1) SCC 471), the Hon’ble Apex\nCourt in paragraph No. 26 has held as follows:-\n“26. We too countenance three possibilities when an accused\npoints out the place where a dead body or an incriminating\nmaterial was concealed without stating that it was conceded by\nhimself. One is that he himself would have concealed it. Second\nis that, he would have seen somebody else concealing it. And\nthe third is that he would have been told by another person that\nit was concealed there. But if the accused declines to tell the\ncriminal court that his knowledge about the concealment was on\naccount of one of the last two possibilities the criminal court can\npresume that it was concealed by the accused himself. This is\nbecause accused is the only person who can offer the\nexplanation as to how else he came to know of such\nconcealment and if he chooses to refrain from telling the court as\nto how else he came to know of it, the presumption is a well\njustified course to be adopted by the criminal court that the\nconcealment was made by himself. Such an interpretation is not\ninconsistent with the principle embodied in Section 27 of the\nEvidence Act”\n40. In the case at hand, upon perusing the confession statement, the\naccused confessed that he had concealed the clothes at a place in\nPammankode Colony and would show them, if he was brought there. PW6\nobtained information regarding the concealed location from the accused,\nand subsequently, the articles were recovered as taken out by the\naccused from a building situated in Pammankode Colony.\n\n22\n\n41. The contention of the learned Deputy Chief Legal Aid Defence that\nthe confession statement failed to disclose the exact place of\nconcealment of objects and, therefore, lost its relevance cannot be\naccepted, as the subsequent recovery of the MOs from a location\ndisclosed by the accused confirmed the information. | am inclined to\naccept the prosecution case regarding the recovery of MO7 and MO8,\nbased on Ext. P10(a), the confession statement given by accused No. 1.\nThis can be taken as a connecting link in the chain of circumstances to\nform a complete chain.\n\n42. Next, the forensic evidence presented must be analyzed. Ext.P18 is\nthe forensic science laboratory report, submitted by the Director of the\nForensic Science Laboratory, Thiruvananthapuram. No specific proof is\nrequired for this document by virtue of Section 294(4)(e) of the CrPC.\nThis document certifies that item Nos. 1 to 5, 8, and 9 contained human\nblood belonging to blood group B. Item No. 1 is a lungi with red, black,\nand white designs; item No. 2 is a soiled lungi with black, green, and\nwhite colored designs; item No. 3 is a cut-open, sleeveless baniyan with\nlight rose, reddish brown, and brick red colors; item No. 4 is a rusted\nmetallic rod with a maximum length of 77 cm. One end of it is made into\na ring, and the other end is pointed. These are the MOs recovered while\npreparing the inquest of the deceased, Vinayakumar. PW1, the wife of\nthe deceased, and PW5, a social worker who was present during the\npreparation of the inquest and examination of the body of the deceased,\n\n23\n\nidentified them as MO1 to MO4. MO4 is an iron bar found at the scene of\nthe crime. Item Nos. 8 and 9 (MO7 and MO8) are a dhoti and a full sleeve\nshirt, recovered based on a confession statement given by accused No.\n1, as per Ext. P10 recovery mahazar. These MOs were recovered on\n25/06/2010. The Court received the same as T.No. 333/2010. Ext. P18\nindicates that item Nos. 8 and 9 are the properties received by the court\nas T.No. 333/2010. The clothes said to have been worn by accused No. 1\nat the relevant time contained human blood belonging to blood group B.\nSo, the clothes worn by the deceased and those worn by the accused\nboth contained human blood of the same B group. The blood group of the\ndeceased was determined at the blood bank, Medical College Hospital,\nThiruvananthapuram, and it was found to be B RH +ve. This fact is\nrevealed from Ext. P8, the postmortem certificate. This is very\nsignificant, as human blood belonging to blood group B was detected on\nthe clothes worn by the deceased as well as on the clothes worn by\naccused No. 1. No explanation has been offered by accused No. 1 as to\nhow the same blood group detected from the MOs recovered from the\ndeceased ended up on his clothes worn at the relevant time. It is worth\nnoting that, PW2 and PW9 noticed blood on accused No. 1’s body as well\nas on the clothes he was wearing. PW17 also asserted that the clothes,\nwhen recovered, contained blood. When all this evidence is taken\ncumulatively, this is a very strong connecting link that connects the\naccused with the crime.\n\n24\n43. The next important aspect presented by the prosecution is the\nextra-judicial confession given by the accused. The latest authority on\nthe point is held by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Ramu Appa Mahapatar\nv. State of Maharashtra (2025 KHC Online 6103). The Hon’ble\nApex Court held as follows:-\nExtra-judicial confession can be relied upon and conviction can be\nbased thereon if the evidence about the confession comes from a\nwitness who appear to be unbiased, not even remotely inimical to\nthe accused, and in respect of whom nothing is brought out which\nmay tend to indicate that he may have a motive of attributing an\nuntruthful statement to the accused. The words spoken by the\nwitness should be clear, unambiguous and unmistakenly convey\nthat the accused is the perpetrator of the crime and that nothing\nis omitted by the witness which may militate against it. After\nsubjecting the evidence of the witness to a rigorous test on the\ntouchstone of credibility, the extra-judicial confession can be\naccepted and can be the basis of a conviction if it passes the test\nof credibility. If the evidence relating to extra-judicial confession\nis found credible after being tested on the touchstone of\ncredibility and acceptability, it can solely form the basis of\nconviction. The requirement of corroboration is a matter of\nprudence and not an invariable rule of flaw. This court\nacknowledged that extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of\nevidence. Wherever the court intends to base a conviction on an\nextra-judicial confession, it must ensure that the same inspires\nconfidence and is corroborated by other prosecution evidence. If\nthe extra-judicial confession suffers from material discrepancies or\ninherent improbabilities and does not appear to be cogent, such\nevidence should not be considered.\n\n25\n44. | have analyzed the evidence of PW2 and PW9 in light of the\naforesaid verdict of the Hon'ble Apex Court. Both PW2 and PW9 are from\nthe hometown of accused No. 1. The evidence tendered by PW2 indicates\nthat accused No. 1 is his neighbour. He stated that he found Sajeev on\nthe evening of the day Vinayan was murdered, at around 10:30 PM, while\nhe was returning home, after buying a cigarette from his friend's\nmother's shop. He noticed bloodstains on the dhoti worn by accused No.\n1. Sajeev told him that, on that day at 3 PM, he went with Vinayan to\nKarunthalkadavu to consume liquor. There, a scuffle occurred following\nan argument, and during that night, in retaliation, he beat Vinayan. Then,\nPW9, a resident of Pammankode, provided evidence that on 13/05/2010\nat about 7:30 - 8 PM, while he was standing in front of his house, he saw\nSajeev going towards the Ninamkonam area with an iron rod. Later, at\naround 10:00 - 10:30 PM, Sajeev approached him at his house, and he\nnoticed blood on Sajeev’s body. When asked, Sajeev stated that he had\nattacked Vinayan. So, PW2 and PW9 have provided evidence regarding\nthe confession made to them by accused No. 1 immediately after the\nincident. All of them are local people, and their evidence indicate that\nthey were usually interacting with the accused. Both of them are rustic\nwitnesses. The accused No. 1 voluntarily made the aforesaid statements\nto PW2 and PW9, local people, without any inducement or threat. There\nis no reason for PW2 and PW9 to provide such false evidence against\n\n26\naccused No. 1. Their evidence is reliable and credible, and there is\nnothing to disbelieve their version.\n45. Additionally, other evidence adduced by PW3 and PW/7 is also\nrelevant. PW3 deposed that while he was watching a serial at his house,\nSajeev came to his house and asked him to come along for some work on\n13/05/2010 at 8:30 PM. Sajeev was holding an iron rod in his hand. PW7\ntestified that he saw Sajeev lead towards the road leading to the house\nof the deceased, Vinayan, that night. PW7 and PW9 identified MO5 as the\niron rod held by Sajeev at the relevant time. Therefore, the evidence\ntendered by PW3 and PW7 aligns well with the evidence provided by PW2\nand PW9. In this context, the evidence tendered by PW2 and PW9 can be\naccepted as linking evidence to corroborate the prosecution allegations\nagainst the accused.\n46. Then, | shall consider Ext. P8, the postmortem certificate, which\nwas marked through PW14, an additional witness, since the doctor\n(CW19), who conducted the postmortem examination of the deceased is\nno longer alive. As stated earlier, PW14 is also a Forensic Professor and a\nPolice Surgeon. The evidence tendered by PW14 and Ext. P8, the\npostmortem certificate, established that rigor mortis was _ fully\nestablished and retained all over the body of the deceased when the\npostmortem examination commenced on 14/05/2010 at 2:50 PM.\n47. Inthis context, | am placing reliance on an article dated 30/05/2023\npublished by the WNationa/ Library of Medicine, National Center for\n\n27\nBiotechnology Information, as part of its continuing educational activities\nregarding the methods of estimating the time since death. It states that\nrigor mortis is the postmortem stiffening of muscles caused by the\ndepletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from the muscles, which Is\nnecessary for the breakdown of actin-myosin filaments in the muscle\nfibers. Actin and myosin are components of the muscle fiber and form a\nbond during contraction. The cessation of oxygen supply causes the\nstoppage of aerobic respiration in the cells and leads to a lack of ATP\nproduciton. Rigor mortis starts immediately after death and is usually\nseen in a sequence known as the “march of rigor” and Nysten’s law.\nWhile rigor mortis develops simultaneously in all muscle tissue in the\nbody, voluntary and involuntary, the size of the muscle determines the\nperceptibility of changes by the examiner. Smaller muscles over the fact\n- around the yees, around the mouth, etc. are the muscles where rigor\nmortis first appears, followed by rigor mortis of the muscles in the hands\nand upper limbs and finally appears in the large muscles of the lower\nlimbs. Rigor mortis appears approximately, 2 hours after death in the\nmuscles of the face, progresses to the limbs over the next few hours,\ncompleting between 6 to 8 hours after death. Rigor mortis then stays for\nanother 12 hours (till 24 hours after death) and then disappears. In the\nlast phase of rigor mortis, the actin-myosin complex that has formed\nstarts disintegrating due to proteolysis, resulting in the dissolution of the\nstiffness. This process begins in all the cells at the same time. However,\n\n28\n\njust like with the appearance, this change is perceptible first in the\nsmaller muscles of the face, followed by muscles of the upper limbs, and\nfinally the large muscles in the lower limbs. Rigor mortis generally\ndisappears 36 hours after death, followed by a phase known as\nsecondary flaccidity.\n\n48. PW17 Investigating officer filed Ext. P13, a report showing the date\nand time of death of the deceased, Vinayan. According to this report, the\nincident occurred on 13/05/2010 at around 9:45 PM. Accused No. 1\nconfessed to PW2 and PW9 around 10:30 PM that he had attacked the\ndeceased. Thus, the time of death, based on the findings in Ext.P8, the\npostmortem certificate, and the evidence tendered by PW14, adds\nstrength to the evidence provided by the aforementioned prosecution\nwitnesses, which points to the guilt of accused No. 1.\n\n49. Another point to be established by the prosecution is the\nabsconding of the accused No.1 following the death of Vinayakumar.\nConvincing and cogent evidence has been presented to prove this\nallegation. The evidence provided by PW2 indicates that, the following\nmorning, while he was returning home after his bath, he found accused\nNo.1 talking to his contractor and also to Binu. When he asked Sajeev\nabout Vinayan’s death, Sajeev became stressed and said that he was\nleaving the area. He also borrowed Rs.500/- from the contractor. PW2\nasserted that after this, he did not see accused No.1 again. In this\ncontext, the evidence tendered by PW6 is highly significant. He stated\n\n29\n\nthat he knows Sajeev, and on 14/05/2010, Sajeev borrowed Rs.500/- from\nhim. After that, he did not see him again. PW17 arrested the accused on\n15/06/2010 at 6:30 PM, and Ext.P9 series documents establish this.\nTherefore, the evidence provided by PW2 and PW6 strongly supports the\nprosecution case regarding the absconding of accused No.1 the very next\nmorning. Thus, the absconding of the accused No.1, after the incident is\na crucial link connecting the accused to the crime.\n\n50. According to the prosecution case, the scuffle that occurred on the\nafternoon of the day Vinayan was murdered is the motive behind the\nattack. The prosecution has adduced evidence regarding the motive as\nwell. However, no direct evidence has been presented to prove this. PW2\ntestified that accused No.1 told him that on that day, at 3 PM, he went\nwith Vinayan to Karunthalkadavu to consume liquor. There, a scuffle\noccurred following an argument. The contention that the incident stated\nas motive is not sufficient to kill another is without merit, in my opinion.\nThis is because no one can predict how the human mind will react in a\nparticular moment. Even minor provocations can lead to significant\nviolence, and reactions may vary from person to person. Sometimes, the\nresponse is disproportionate to the initial incident. Therefore, | do not\nagree with the contention of the learned Deputy Chief Legal Aid Defence\nCounsel that the stated motive is insufficient to commit murder. | am\ninclined to accept the evidence of PW2, in light of the aforementioned\n\n30\n\nother evidence regarding the conduct of accused No.1 both prior to and\nafter the incident.\n\n51. As per the prosecution allegation, accused No.1 used MO5, an iron\nrod, and MO6, a chopper, to attack the deceased. In this context, the\nevidence tendered by PW7 is relevant. He stated that he saw accused\nNo.1 going to the house of accused No.2, taking an iron rod from his\nhouse, and proceeding along the path leading to the house of the\ndeceased. He identified MO5 as the iron rod. PW17 deposed that accused\nNo.1 confessed that the chopper and iron rod used by him were given to\naccused No.2. Later, while in custody, Accused No.2 confessed that the\nchopper and iron rod were kept in a specific place in his house and that\nhe would show them, if brought there. Based on this confession\nstatement, MO5 and MO6 were recovered from behind the sixth arecanut\nreaper of the thatched roof of the kitchen in accused No.2's house. PW17\nrecovered them as per Ext.P4, the recovery mahazar. The said iron rod\n(MO5) was identified by PW7 and PW9 as being held by accused No.1 at\nthe relevant time. PW3 deposed that he saw accused No.1 holding an\niron rod in his hand, similar to MO5. Therefore, the evidence on record\nproves that accused No.1 proceeded to the house of the deceased while\nholding MO5, the iron rod. PW14, the forensic surgeon, stated that the\nantemortem injury Nos. 6, 7, and 8 noted in Ext.P8, the postmortem\ncertificate, could have been caused by MO5, the iron rod. Although no\nblood was detected on MO5, the cogent evidence tendered by PW3, PW7,\n\n31\n\nand PW9 establishes the use of MO5, the iron rod, by accused No.1 to\nattack the deceased. PW14 further opined that injury Nos. 1 to 5 could\nhave been caused by MO6, the chopper.\n\n52. The prosecution case is that accused No.2 concealed the weapon\nused by accused No.1 in his house. The weapons were recovered from\nthe house of accused No.2 based on Ext.P4(a), the confession statement\ngiven by accused No.2 to PW17. As stated earlier, PW17 recovered them\nas per Ext.P4, the recovery mahazar. PW8, an independent witness,\ntestified in support of the recovery of these weapons from the house of\naccused No.2. PW8 is an attestor to Ext.P4, the recovery mahazar. He\nidentified accused No.2 as the person brought by the police near his\nhouse. During cross-examination, he stated that he saw the police\nstanding there with accused No.2 and the MOs. The police were coming\nout of the house of accused No.2, Shibu. He further asserted that the\npolice seized MO5 and MO6 from Charuvilla House at Pammankode. The\nhouse of accused No.2 is Charuvilla Puthen Veedu. Thus, the evidence\ntendered by PW8 strongly supports the prosecution case, regarding the\nrecovery of MO5 and MO6 from the house of accused No.2. Clearly, it\nadds strength to the prosecution case regarding the recovery of these\nweapons based on Ext.P4(a), the confession made by accused No.2. As\nstated earlier, it is well established law that in order to make a disclosure\nstatement relevant under Section 27 of the Evidence Act, there must be\nsubsequent confirmation. Therefore, the recovery of the MOQOs\n\n32\nsubstantiates the prosecution case regarding the disclosure statement\nmade by accused No.2. In light of the principles laid down in State of\nMaharashtra v. Suresh (supra), the recovery can be accepted. It can also\nbe taken as a connecting link in a chain of circumstances to form a\ncomplete chain.\n53. In this context, the evidence tendered by PW14, stating that\nantemortem injury Nos. 1 to 5 noted in Ext.P8, the postmortem\ncertificate, could have been caused by MO6, the chopper, and that\nantemortem injury Nos. 6, 7, and 8 could have been caused by MO5, the\niron rod, is highly significant. This is because both facts, the recovery of\nMO5 and MO6 based on the confession statement of accused No.2 and\nthe possibility that antemortem injury Nos. 1 to 8 could have been\ncaused by MO5 and MO6, strongly corroborate the prosecution case that\naccused No.1 handed over the weapons to accused No.2 after\ncommitting the offence. The possible inference, therefore, would be that\nthe accused No.1 is responsible for the commission of the murder of the\ndeceased.\n54. The case is based on circumstantial evidence, and it is settled law\nthat the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is drawn must\nbe fully proven, and such circumstances must be conclusive in nature. In\nthis context, when the evidence on record is analyzed, the prosecution\nhas established the following evidence, which allows for the inference:-\n\n33\n(a) On 14/05/2010 at 8:30 AM, PW1, the wife of the deceased\nVinayan, found him lying dead. Her husband had been present in the\nhouse, the previous night.\n(b) At around 10:30 PM on 13/05/2010, accused No.1 told PW2 and\nPW9 that he attacked Vinayan and informed PW2 that the attack was\nin retaliation for an incident that occurred at 3:00 PM between him\nand Vinayan while they were consuming liquor at Karunthalkadavu.\n(c) Accused No.1 absconded upon learning of the death of the\ndeceased on the morning of 14/05/2010, after borrowing Rs.500/-\nfrom PW6.\n(d) On 13/05/2010 at around 8 - 8.30 PM , accused No.1 approached\nPW3 and PW7, asking them to come along with him. He then\nproceeded along the path leading to the house of the deceased,\nVinayan, with an iron rod.\n(e) MO1 to MO4 were recovered during the preparation of Ext.P3, the\ninquest report, after examining the body of the deceased.\n(f) MO7 and MO8, the dhoti and shirt worn by accused No.1 at the\nrelevant time, were recovered based on Ext.P10(a), the confession\nstatement given by accused No.1 to PW17, while the accused was in\nthe custody of PW17.\n(g) The blood group of the deceased was B Rh +ve.\n(h) MO1 to MO3, recovered from the person of the deceased, MO4,\nthe iron bar recovered from the scene of the crime, and MO8 and\n\n34\n\nMO10, the clothes worn by accused No.1 at the relevant time,\n\ncontained human blood belonging to group B.\n\n(i) The accused did not offer any explanation as to how the blood\n\nfound on the clothes and slippers worn by the deceased was also\n\ndetected on his clothes.\n\n(j) The accused used MO5, an iron rod, and MO6, a chopper, to attack\n\nthe deceased. These weapons were recovered based on the\n\nconfession statement given by accused No.2 to PW17, while the\n\naccused was in the custody of PW17.\n55. All the aforementioned circumstances are complete, with no gap\nleft in the chain of evidence. The proved circumstances are consistent\nwith the hypothesis of the guilt of accused No.1 and completely\ninconsistent with his innocence. Based on the circumstantial evidence\ndiscussed, the inference of the guilt of accused No.1 can be justified.\n56. The contention that the brother of the deceased was also present in\nthe house cannot absolve accused No.1 of liability from the\ncircumstances discussed above. The police, after a thorough\ninvestigation, have implicated accused No.1 in this case. The\ncircumstances discussed above substantiate the decision of the\ninvestigating officer. The mere presence of the brother of the deceased,\nwho is no longer alive, though cited as CW1, cannot be a ground to give\nany benefit of doubt to accused No.1 in the given circumstances.\n\n35\n\n57. The evidence tendered by PW14 and the Ext.P8 postmortem\ncertificate clearly mention the antemortem injuries sustained by the\ndeceased. There were 23 antemortem injuries. PW14 opined that injury\nNos. 1 to 8, with their effect on the brain, were sufficient, in the ordinary\ncourse of nature, to cause death. Injury Nos. 1 to 5 are incised wounds,\nand injury No. 6 is a contusion, with the upper orbital margin showing a\nfissured fracture. Injury Nos. 7 and 8 are lacerated wounds. The right,\ncentral, and lateral incisor teeth of the upper jaw were fractured at their\nroot and depressed. Underneath antemortem injuries Nos. 2 to 5, the\noccipital bone was fractured and fragmented, with a fissured fracture\nextending through the left parietal bone. These injuries demonstrate the\nforce used by the accused No.1 to attack the deceased. The antemortem\ninjuries show that Accused No.1 brutally attacked the victim with MO5\nand MO6. The injuries clearly indicate that the accused assaulted the\ndeceased with the intention of causing such bodily injury, knowing that it\nwas likely to cause the victim’s death.\n\n58. The prosecution case is that accused No.1 and accused No.2\nentered into a criminal conspiracy, and that accused No.1 attacked\nVinayan, the deceased in furtherance of their common intention to cause\nhis death and concealed the MOs. However, there is practically no\nevidence to prove the criminal conspiracy between the accused. It is true\nthat the witnesses testified about the presence of accused No.2 along\nwith accused No.1 at night. However, their evidence indicate that other\n\n36\n\npeople, namely Ragesh, Binu and Sudhi, were also present with accused\nNo.1. Admittedly, according to the prosecution case, accused No.2 was\nnot involved in committing the murder of Vinayan. Moreover, as per the\nevidence tendered by PW2, accused No.2 was not present during the\nincident that took place in the afternoon of that day, which led to the\nretaliation resulting in the killing of the deceased. Thus, the presence of\naccused No.2 alongside accused No.1 and other individuals is not at all\nsufficient to establish the criminal conspiracy between the accused. In\nlight of this, | have no hesitation in holding that the prosecution has\nmiserably failed to show that accused No.2 entered into a criminal\nconspiracy with accused No.1, and that accused No.1 committed the\nmurder of the deceased in furtherance of the common intention of both\naccused.\n\n59. | have already mentioned the evidence of PW2, PW3, and PW7\nregarding the presence of accused No.2 along with Accused No.1 at the\nrelevant time. Therefore, he should have known about the commission of\nthe offence by accused No.1. | have already concluded that MO5 and\nMO6 were used by accused No.1 to commit the offence, and the\nprosecution further established that these weapons were recovered from\nthe house of accused No.2. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor\npointed out the admission of accused No.2 during the examination under\nSection 313 of the CrPC, where he stated that the iron rod was recovered\nfrom the construction site of his house with the help of a police dog.\n\n37\n\nHowever, even otherwise, the aforementioned evidence establishes the\nrecovery of MO5 and MO6 from the house of accused No.2. He cannot\nwash his hands of the responsibility for concealing the weapons in his\nhouse. | am of the opinion that the prosecution has established beyond a\nreasonable doubt that accused No.2 knew, or had reason to believe, that\nthe offence was committed by accused No.1, using MO5 and MO6. With\nsuch knowledge, he concealed MO5 and MO6 in his house in order to\ndestroy the evidence of the commission of the offence. Without accused\nNo.1 handing over the weapons to accused No.2, they could not have\ncome into the possession of accused No.2.\n\n60. The discussion leads to the conclusion that the prosecution has\nsuccessfully established that accused No.1 committed the murder of\nVinayan. Hence, he is found guilty of the offence punishable under\nSection 302 of the Indian Penal Code and convicted him under Section\n235(2) of the CrPC for the said offence. Accused Nos.1 and 2 are found\nguilty of the offence punishable under Section 201 r/w 34 of the IPC and\nconvicted them under Section 235(2) of the CrPC for the said offence.\nAccused No.2 is found not guilty of the offence punishable under Section\n302 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code, and accused Nos.1 and 2 are found\nnot guilty of the offence punishable under Section 120B of the Indian\nPenal Code, and they are acquitted under Section 235(1) of the CrPC for\nthe said offences. The points are answered accordingly.\n\n38\n\nHaving considered the facts and circumstances of the case, | am\nnot inclined to invoke the provisions of Section 360 CrPC.

SESSIONS JUDGE- V.\n28/02/2025\n61. Point No. (iv):-\n\nAccused Nos.1 and 2 were heard on sentence. They submitted that,\nthey have families to maintain and no one to help them. They are the\nsole breadwinners of their family. The learned deputy chief legal aid de-\nfence counsel for the accused submitted that, the accused deserved a le-\nnient view in the matter of sentencing.\n\n62. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor submitted to impose the\nmaximum penalty.\n\n63. In the matter of sentence, it is beneficial to go through Gopal\nSingh v. State of Uttarakhand (2013 KHC 4133). The Hon’ble Apex\nCourt held that, just punishment is the collective cry of the society. While\ncollective cry has to be kept uppermost in the mind, simultaneously the\nprinciple of proportionality between the crime and punishment cannot be\ntotally brushed aside. Their Lordships held that the nature of culpability,\n\n39\n\nthe antecedents of the accused, the factum of age, the potentiality of the\nconvict to become a criminal in future, capability of his reformation and\nto lead an acceptable life are the factors to be considered. Similarly, an\noffender cannot be allowed to be treated with leniency solely on the\nground of discretion vested in a Court.\n\n64. Here, there were 23 antemortem injuries sustained by the victim.\nInjury Nos. 1 to 5 are incised wounds, and injury No. 6 is a contusion,\nwith the upper orbital margin showing a fissured fracture. Injury Nos. 7\nand 8 are lacerated wounds. The right, central, and lateral incisor teeth\nof the upper jaw were fractured at their root and depressed. Underneath\nantemortem injury Nos. 2 to 5, the occipital bone was fractured and\nfragmented, with a fissured fracture extending through the left parietal\nbone. These injuries demonstrate the force used by the accused No.1 to\nattack the deceased. The antemortem injuries show that, accused No.1\nbrutally attacked the victim with MO5 and MO6. _ Injury Nos. 1 to 8 with\ntheir effect on the brain resulted in the death of Vinayakumar. It was\nevidently an one sided attack by the accused, actuated by the motives\nmentioned. For the purpose of passing adequate sentence, it is\nnecessary to consider the age, family background, antecedents, the\ngravity of the crime and impact of the crime on the society and also the\npossibility of the accused being reformed. Here, | am of the considered\nopinion that there is a chance of reformation.\n\n40\n\nOn considering all these facts and circumstances, | am of the\nopinion that the case would not come under the category of rarest of rare\ncases. Bearing in mind all these facts and circumstances of the case, |\nfind that the following sentence would serve the purpose:-\n\n(a) Accused No.1 is sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for\n\nlife and to pay fine of Rs.1,00,000/- (Rupees One Lakh only) and in\n\ndefault of payment of fine, to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a\n\nfurther period of one year for the offence punishable Under Section\n\n302 of the IPC.\n\n(b) Accused Nos.1 and 2 are sentenced to undergo rigorous\n\nimprisonment for a period of 2 (Two) years each and to pay\n\nfine of Rs.10,000/- (Rupees Ten Thousand only) each and in default\n\nof payment of fine, to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a further\n\nperiod of One month each for the offence punishable Under Section\n\n201 r/w Section 34 of the IPC.\n\n(c) If fine amount is paid, Rs.1 lakh shall be paid to PW1, the\n\nwife of the deceased Vinayakumar, U/S. 357(1)(b) Cr.P.C.\n\n(d) The sentences shall run concurrently.\n\n(e). The accused are entitled to set off their under trial\n\nimprisonment against the substantive sentence U/S 428 of the\n\nCrPC. If the Government exercises its powers U/S 433 of the\n\nCr.P.C., the period during which the accused No.1 had been in\n\n41\ncustody in connection with this case will be set off and the default\nclauses mentioned above will come into force.\nThe pre-conviction detention undergone by the accused is_ stated\nbelow:-\nprom | TO\n15/06/2010 28/08/2010\nAccused No.1 24/08/2013 08/11/2013\n07/08/2017 19/06/2019\n26/07/2024 28/02/2025\nAccused No.2 27/08/2010 18/09/2010\n(f) MOs being valueless, shall be destroyed after the expiry of\nappeal period.\nDictated to the Confidential Assistant, typed by her, corrected by\nme and pronounced in Open Court on this, the 28\" day of February,\n2025.\nSd/-\nSIJU SHEIK,\nADDL.
