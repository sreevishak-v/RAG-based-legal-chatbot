No. 300 of 2019\nPetitioner : 1.Sindhu V S&S, D/o.Vijayakumari, Vijayabhavan,\nHouse Number 7/1913, Kariyam, Sreekaryam P O,\nThiruvananthapuram\n(By Adv.M Anil Prasad)\nAccused : 1.Latheesh, S/o. Ravi, Rema Bhavan,\nKarumbukonam, Sreekaryam Pp O,\nThiruvananthapuram\n2.Shibu, Police, Sreekaryam Police Station\n3.Vijayakumari, Vijayabhavan, karumbukonam,\nSreekaryam P O, Thiruvananthapuram\n4.Sandhya, W/o. Latheesh, Remabhavan,\nKarumbukonam, Sreekaryam P O,\nThiruvananthapuram\nOrder Accused Nos. 1 to 4 are discharged under\nSection 245(2) of the CrPC of the offences\nunder Sections 294(b), 323, 324, 341 and 441 of\nthe IPC.\nThis case having come up for consideration before this Court on\n07.01.2025, this Court on the same day passes the following:\nORDER\n1. This case arose on a Private Complaint filed by the Complainant alleging\ncommission of the offences under Sections 294(b), 323, 324, 341 and 441 of the\nIPC against the Accused persons. The Complaint was taken on file against\nAccused Nos. 1 to 4 for the above offences vide Order of this Court dated\n25.05.2019.\n\n2. This case is in the stage of pre-charge enquiry, i.e., posted evidence of\nComplainant under Section 244 CrPC since 13.10.2020. This Court had posted\nthis matter twice as last chance for Complainant’s evidence on 04.10.2024 and\n04.12.2024 respectively. The Complainant was continuously absent thereafter\nand twice applied orally on ground of illness. However, they were duly\nrepresented by their respective Counsel. In fact, the Complainant through his\nCounsel on 04.12.2025 filed a ‘not press memo’ and finally, the case was posted\nfor evidence as No Further Time on 04.01.2025.\n\n3. It is pertinent to note that despite having granted sufficient opportunities\nto the Complainant to adduce evidence as elucidated above, and it is submitted\nthat she does not intend to proceed with the case further and not press memo\nalso filed to that effect. The Accused, though absent, applied and were\nrepresented by their Counsel.\n\nIt is well settled that a Complainant seeking to formulate a charge\nagainst accused is bound to adduce evidence in support of his case at the stage\nof pre - charge enquiry since evidence already recorded by the Court under\nSections 200 and 202 of CrPC is not admissible in evidence nor binding on the\nAccused. Neglect of the complainant to proceed with the enquiry and adduce\nevidence must be reckoned by the Magistrate to be a situation where the\ncomplainant lacked necessary materials in support of accusation and therefore\nthe proposed charge is groundless. (See Rahmath v. State of Kerala and Others,\n2020 (4) KHC 90)\n\nFrom a careful consideration of the records in this case and the conduct\nof the Complainant, it appears to this Court that the Complainant does not\nintend to proceed with the above matter. This Court is satisfied the Complainant\nhas neglected to participate in the pre-charge enquiry despite umpteen\nopportunities granted to her to adduce evidence in support of his case and that\nhe has failed, for no good reasons in adducing the evidence requisite for\nformulating charge against the Accused. This is further fortified by the not\npress memo filed by the Complainant. This can only lead to the conclusion that\nshe lacks materials in support of her accusation and that the proposed charge is\ngroundless. In wake of above circumstances, this Court does not find any other\nreason to proceed with the matter further, as continuation of the proceeding\nany longer, in absence of Complainant at this stage would remain only a futile\nexercise and would cause serious prejudice to the Accused. Hence the Accused\n\npersons are discharged of the aforesaid offences under Section 245(2) of the\nCrPC.\n\n4. Resultantly, the Accused Nos. 1 to 4 are discharged under Section 245(2)\nof the CrPC of the above offences under Sections 294(b), 323, 324, 341 and 441\nof the IPC.\n\n(Pronounced in open court on this the 7% day of January, 2025)\nJudicial Magistrate of First Class-I\nThiruvananthapuram\n\n"
