No.345 of\n2002 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-V,\nThiruvananthapuram has approached this Court seeking for a\ndirection to the court concerned to expedite the proceedings in\nthe above case and to dispose it of within a time frame.\n\n2. The case came up for admission on 20.12.2018 and\nthis Court had directed the court concerned to report the\npresent stage of the case. Accordingly, the said court had\nreported that the case was originally taken on file as C.C.\nNo.164 of 1999. Accused Nos.4 and 5 were absconding at\nthat point of time and therefore, the case against them was\nsplit up and refiled as C.C. No.345 of 2002. The trial against\naccused Nos.i to 3 were already over and they were\nconvicted. The case records were submitted before the Court\nof Sessions, as Crl.R.P.No.225 of 2002 is pending consideration\nthere. Thereafter, the records of the case were received back\nby the court on 25.05.2006 and incorporated with the case.\nBut, certain relevant documents were found missing from the\ncase bundle and earnest efforts are being taken to trace it out.\nIt is reported by the court concerned that, for the reason, the\ntrial in the case could not be proceeded with at an expeditious\n\npa\nCrl.MC.No. 8796 of 2018 3 2019IKERII66\nmanner. It is reported by the court concerned that the trial\ncould be proceeded with only when the missing documents are\ntraced out. It is also reported by the Magistrate that the case\nstands posted to 15.02.2019.\n\n3. The learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted\nthat the marriage of the petitioner's daughter is scheduled\nafter two months and his presence is required for\naccumulating funds for the marriage.\n\nIn the event of the matter reported by the court\nconcerned that necessary documents are missing, there is no\nmeaning in directing the court to dispose it of in a time bound\nmanner. However, direction is issued to the court concerned to\ntake all earnest efforts to see that the documents are traced\nout and to proceed with the trial at the immediate possible\nopportunity.\n\nWith the above directions, the Crl.M.C is disposed of.\nMARY JOSEPH\nJUDGE\nNAB\n\nsiepeatores a\n3S aaa\nBz ere\nCrl.MC.No. 8796 of 2018 4 201/KERIP66\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S ANNEXURE:\nANNEXURE Al THE TRUE PHOTOCOPY OF THE CERTIFIED COPY OF\nTHE B DIARY ISSUED IN 01/08/2018 BY THE\nHONOURABLE JUDICIAL FIRST CLASS MAGISTRATE\nCOURT- V, THIRUVANANTHAPURAM IN C.C.\nNO.345/2002.\nRESPONDENTS ANNEXURE: NIL\n/TRUE COPY//\nPATO JUDGE\n\n"
