This is a case charge sheeted by the Sub Inspector of Police, Poojappura\nPolice Station in crime No. 179/2010 against the accused, 2 in numbers,\nalleging commission of offences u/s 324, 323, 294(b), 506(i) r/w 34 of IPC.\n\n2. The prosecution case in brief is that, in furtherance of their common intention,\non 12/03/2010 at 7. 30 pm, at house No. T.C 19/1726, KRRA 64 at\nMudavanmugal Ward in Thirumala Village, the 1* accused caught hold on the\nneck of CW2, abused him and kicked on his abdomen and pushed him down.\nWhen CW1 intervened, the 1* and 2\" accused threw bricks at CW1 thereby\ncausing injury on the right side of her forehead. The accused also threw piece\nof brick at CW3 thereby causing injury to her and also criminally intimidated\nCW1 by threatening to kill her. The accused thereby committed the offences\nas alleged against them.\n\n3. Originally the case was taken on file as CC: 328/2010. Since the accused were\nabsconding, the case was entered in LPR as LP: 55/2017. Thereafter, the\naccused were arrested and produced before the court on 01/01/2018 and the\ncase was taken out from LPR and refiled as CC: 1/2018.\n\n4, Accused Nos. 1 and 2 were enlarged on bail and they were furnished with\ncopies of all relevant prosecution records. After hearing, charge for the\noffences u/s 324, 323, 294(b), 506(i) r/w 34 of IPC was framed and it was\nread over and explained to them and they pleaded not guilty.\n\n5. To prove their case, the prosecution examined CW1, CW3 and CW2 as PW1\nto PW3 respectively and marked a document as Ext.P1. Since the witnesses\nexamined did not support the prosecution, CW4 to CW7 were given up by the\nlearned APP. Hence, the prosecution evidence was closed. As there were no\n\n3\nincriminating circumstances brought out in evidence against accused,\nexamination u/s 313 of Cr.P.C was not necessary. The accused did not adduce\nany evidence.\n\n6. Heard both the sides.\n\n7. The points that arise for consideration are:-\n\n1. Whether the accused had committed the offences punishable u/s 324,\n323, 294(b), 506(i) r/w 34 of IPC, as alleged?\n2. What shall be the sentence or order?\n\n8. Point No.1 :- The evidence in this case consists of depositions of 3 witnesses\nand 1 document from the side of the prosecution. PW1 deposed that accused\nare her brother and his wife. She deposed that on 12/03/2010 somebody\nattacked her after switching off the light. She affirmed lodging Ext.P1 FI\nStatement given to police. She further deposed that the matter was settled and\nshe has no grievances against the accused. PW2 is the sister of PW1. She\ndeposed affirming the incident, but stated that she had not seen who had\nattacked them. PW3, the other injured also deposed in similar lines and stated\nthat he did not know the assailants. Thus, all the material witnesses turned\nhostile to prosecution. Therefore, the learned Assistant Public Prosecutor gave\nup the remaining witnesses. From the above evidence, there is nothing to\nprove the occurrence as alleged or to connect the accused with the offences.\nThus, the prosecution failed to prove that the accused committed the offences\nws 324, 323, 294(b), 506(i) r/w 34 of IPC Point No.1 is found against the\nprosecution.\n\n9. Point No.2 :- In view of my finding on point no.1, the accused Nos. 1 and 2\n\n4\nare found not guilty of the offences punishable u/s 324, 323, 294(b), 506(i)\nr/w 34 of IPC, they are acquitted u/s 248(1) of CrPC and set at liberty,\ncancelling their bail bonds.\n\nDictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected\n\nand pronounced by me in open Court on this the 28\" day of February 2025.\n\n¢\nElsa Catherine George\nAdditional Chief Judicial Magistrate\nFees oD | Thiruvananthapuram\n\n.
