The allegation of the defacto complainant is\nthat due to previous enmity, the accused on 22.09.2013\nat 11.30 pm, hit the defacto complainant on his head with\na stick. It was alleged that attempts were made to cause\ngrievous injuries. Alleging the above, crime was\nregistered and that the case is now pending. The\npetitioners contended that the disputes have been settled\nbetween the parties and the defacto complainant has no\nfurther grievance as against the petitioners herein.\nThough Section 308 IPC is attributed, in fact no injuries\nare caused on the_ head. Even according to the\n\nieee\n2017/KER/1797\n\nCrl.M.C.No.4560 of 2016 2\n\nprosecution allegation is that had the hit not been warded\noff, the victim would have sustained grievous injuries.\nHowever, the antecedents of the petitioners herein does\nnot appear to be appreciable. It was submitted by the\nlearned Public Prosecutor that the first petitioner is\ninvolved in several cases and is included in the rowdy list.\nIt is further submitted by the learned Public Prosecutor\nthat the second petitioner was involved in KAPPA\nproceedings. However, the learned counsel for the\npetitioners submitted that the KAPPA proceedings were\nwithdrawn by the order of the Government dated\n02.06.2015. The copy of the above order indicating that\nKAPPA proceedings were withdrawn pursuant to the\nopinion of the advisory board, placed on_ record.\nHowever, having considered the fact that the allegations\nagainst the petitioners herein are serious and that the\npetitioners are involved in several other cases, I am not\ninclined to hold that the dispute is of a personal nature\nand hence can be settled.\n\nTLRs\nae oe\napie\n2017/KERI1797\nCri.M.C.No.4560 of 2016 3\nCri.M.C is closed reserving the right of the\npetitioners herein to move at the trial court at appropriate\nstage.\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE\nR.AV\n/{True Copy//\nPA to Judge\n\n"
