M.C. ASHI (PP)\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n05.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nPel\nripe\n2024/KER/632\nCRL.MC NO. 74 OF 2024\n2\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J\nee ee\nORDER\nPetitioner is the accused in Crime No.643/2018 of Ernakulam\nCentral Police Station, now pending as C.C.No.1630/2018 on\nthe files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,\nErnakulam.\n\n2. Prosecution allegation is that, on 04.03.2018 at about 9.30 a.m,\nwhile the de facto complainant was distributing certain\npamphlets to enforce the Church Act in front of St.Maryâ€™s\nBasilica, the accused came in a bike and assaulted him after\nbeing wrongfully restrained, and thereby committed the\noffences under Section 341 and 323 of the Indian Penal Code,\n1860.\n\n3. Sri.Sabu Pullan, the learned counsel for the petitioner,\nsubmitted that the entire prosecution allegations are false and\nno materials have been collected to implicate the petitioner in\n\nPel\nBSR aa\n2024/KER/632\nCRL.MC NO. 74 OF 2024\n3\nthe manner alleged. It was further submitted that the incident\nis alleged to have occurred on 04.03.2018, while the complaint\nwas lodged on 05.03.2018 and the final report was submitted\non 06.03.2018, which clearly indicates the hasty manner in\nwhich the investigation was conducted. It was also submitted\nthat the allegations do not make out any of the offences\nalleged.\n\n4. I have heard Sri.M.C.Ashi, the learned Public Prosecutor as\nwell,\n\n5. On a perusal of the final report produced as Annexure III, it is\nevident that the allegations prima facie make out the offenses\nalleged. However, if the petitioner believes that the evidence\ncollected by the investigating officer is not sufficient to\nimplicate him as an accused, the remedy is not by a petition\nunder Section 482 Cr.P.C. Recourse to the remedies under\nSection 482 of the Cr.P.C. can only be in exceptional\ncircumstances, where even if the allegations are admitted the\nsame do not make out any of the offenses alleged. Such a\nsituation does not arise in this case, since it is specifically\n\nPel\nBaa\n2024/KER/632\nCRL.MC NO. 74 OF 2024\n4\nstated that the de facto complainant was wrongfully restrained\nand assaulted by the accused while distributing the pamphlets\nrelating to enforcement of Church Act.\n\n6. Since the ingredients of the offences are prima facie made out\nfrom the allegations, I am of the view that a case under\nSection 482 of Cr.P.C. has not been made out. Accordingly, I\ndismiss this Crl.M.C.\n\nsd/-\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\nAMV/06/01/2024\n\nPel\nenetne\nElz eas\n2024/KER/632\nCRL.MC NO. 74 OF 2024\n5\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 74/2024\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES\nANNEXURE -I TRUE COPY OF THE COMPLAINT FILED BY THE\n3RD RESPONDENT BEFORE THE 2ND\nRESPONDENT DATED 04-03-2018\nANNEXURE - II CERTIFIED COPY OF THE F.I.R IN CRIME\nNO.643/2018 OF ERNAKULAM CENTRAL POLICE\nSTATION DATED 04-03-2018\nANNEXURE - TIT CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT\nFILED BY THE 2ND RESPONDENT IN CRIME\nNO.643/2018 OF ERNAKULAM CENTRAL POLICE\nSTATION DATED 06-03-2018\nTRUE COPY\n\n"
