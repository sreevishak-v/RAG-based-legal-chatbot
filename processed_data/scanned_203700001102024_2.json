M.C. ASHI (PP)\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n15.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\n2024/KER/4083\nCRL.MC NO. 110 OF 2024\n2\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.\nDated this the 15 day of January, 2024\nORDER\n\nPetitioner is the 1 accused in Crime No. 391 of 2022 of\nKasaba Police Station, Palakkad. By the impugned order dated\n29-11-2023, the Crl.M.P.No.5721 of 2023, the learned Session\nJudge allowed the request of the prosecution to extend the\ncustody of the petitioner for a further 180 days as per Section\n36A (4) of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act,\n1985, ( for short, ‘the Act’) since the investigation had not been\ncompleted.\n\n2. The prosecution alleged that 124.935 kgs of Ganja\nwere found abandoned on 03-06-2022 by certain unknown\npersons and thereby committing the offences alleged. During\nthe course of the investigation, petitioner was arrested on\n05-06-2023 and he remains in custody since then. On\n21-11-2023, the learned Public Prosecutor submitted a report\nunder Section 36A(4) of the Act stating that the investigation is\nnot yet over and that custody of the petitioner is to be extended\nfor a further period of six months.\n\nBL hl\n: eM\neee\n[eres\n2024/KER/4083\nCRL.MC NO. 110 OF 2024\n3\n3. The learned Public Prosecutor in its report stated that\naccused 1 to 5 had conspired and proceeded in two vehicles to\nVishakapatanam and purchased huge quantities of ganja. While\ntransporting them to Kerala, one of the vehicles met with an\naccident on 02-06-2022 at Salem, and the entire contraband\nwas shifted to another vehicle. Thereafter, accused 1 and 2 were\nintercepted at the Walayar toll plaza by the Excise Enforcement\nand Anti-Narcotic State Squad. The report further states as\nfollows:-\n“ Thereafter while proceeding towards Walayar Toll\nPlaza the same was intercepted by Excise Enforcement &\nAnti Narcotic State Squad and when an Excise Officer\nnamed Subin was examining the first vehicle on the\nconvoy, ie., KL 05 AV 2235, after getting into it, the said\nvehicle barged through the line barrier of the toll plaza\nand the Excise Officials successfully detained the second\nvehicle ie., KL 05 AA 1551, and after effecting the seizure\nof Ganja, registered a crime in the Palakkad Excise Range\nas Cr.28/2022 U/s.20(b) fii) (B), 25, 29 of NDPS Act.\nAnother crime is also seen registered by the Walayar\nPolice Station as Cr.238/2022 U/s. 332, 392 r/w 34 for\nforcefully taking one of the Excise Officers inside the\nvehicle as aforesaid. It is subsequently turned out that the\nvehicle No.KL 05 AV 2235 which barged through the\nbarricades pushed out the Excise Officer on the roadside\nand thereafter abandoned Ganja contained in several\npackets weighing 124.935 Kgms, as aforesaid at a place\ncalled kaithakuzhi, Elappully Panchayath.”\n\n2024/KER/4083\nCRL.MC NO. 110 OF 2024\n4\n\n4, Apart from the above, it was also stated that during the\ncourse of the investigation, Sections 27A and 29 of the Act also\nhad to be invoked and that two of the accused are still\nabsconding. The report also stated that the crime has interstate\nramifications and require extensive investigation, for which a\nlonger period of investigation was necessary.\n\n5. On the basis of the above report, the learned Session\nJudge granted permission to extend the period for investigation\nby a further 180 days and also permitted the accused to be\ndetained in custody.\n\n6. Sri.Thomas J. Anakkallumkal, the learned counsel for\nthe petitioner, contended that the report of the Public\nProsecutor is not sufficient to grant permission for extending\nthe custody of the petitioner. Relying upon the judgment in\nUbaid A.M. v. State of Kerala 2022 (7) KHC 197 it was pointed\nout that the extension of period of custody ought not have been\ngranted.\n\n7. SriAshi M.C., the learned Public Prosecutor on the\nother hand, opposed the contentions and stated that the\nlearned Session Judge has elaborately considered the reasons\npointed out by the Public Prosecutor and granted an extension\nonly since the circumstances so warranted.\n\n2024/KER/4083\nCRL.MC NO. 110 OF 2024\n5\n\n8. I have considered the rival contentions.\n\n9. The learned Session Judge has, in the impugned order,\nelaborately considered the circumstances and has specified the\nreasons for extending the period of custody of the petitioner. It\nwas specifically mentioned that the investigation has not been\ncompleted and that some of the accused are yet to be arrested.\n\n10. The reasons mentioned in the report submitted by the\nPublic Prosecutor were found to be reasonable, and the\ninvolvement of other persons in financing the purchase of a\nnarcotic drug is a material aspect requiring detailed\ninvestigation. The continuation of the investigation in light of\nthe peculiar facts of the case was found to be essential. With\nthe interstate ramifications pointed out by the Public\nProsecutor, an extensive and exhaustive investigation was held\nto be essential.\n\n11. It is true that in the decision in Ubaid A.M. v. State\nof Kerala 2022 (7) KHC 197, a learned Single Judge of this\nCourt had observed that the Prosecutor cannot act as a ‘Post\nOffice’ while approaching the Court with an application for\nextension of custody. The said judgment observes that in the\nabsence of sufficient reasons for granting extension of custody\nto the accused beyond 180 days, the right of the accused for\nstatutory bail ought not to be denied.\n\nBL hl\n2024/KER/4083\nCRL.MC NO. 110 OF 2024\n6\n\n12. In the instant case, the accused is alleged to have\ntravelled to Visakhapatanam to purchase Ganja and thereafter\ntransported the same in two vehicles to Kerala, and on their\nreturn they were intercepted near the Walayar check-post.\nThereafter, they tried to escape with the Excise Officer inside\nthe vehicle and later pushed him out from the moving vehicle\nand abandoned 124.935 kgms of Ganja on the roadside and\nescaped.\n\n13. Taking note of the above circumstances and the\nnature of the order that has been issued by the learned Session\nJudge, I am of the view that there is no perversity surrounding\nthe impugned order, and on the other hand, the learned\nSession Judge has elaborately considered all the aspects\nrelating to the grant of an extension of custody.\n\n14. Further the decision in Ubaid A.M. v. State of\nKerala 2022 (7) KHC 197 as well as in Dayal v. State of\nKerala 2023 (2) KHC 564 this Court has considered the twin\naspects required under Section 36A (4) proviso for extending the\nperiod of investigation and custody. Though it was observed in\nthe former judgment that the progress of the investigation and\nthe specific reason for detention beyond 180 days ought to be\nspelled out in the report of the Public Prosecutor, in the latter\ndecision, it was stated that it is not necessary to spell out every\n\nBL hl\n= eM\neee\n[eres\n2024/KER/4083\nCRL.MC NO. 110 OF 2024\n7\nminute detail of the investigation to satisfy the Court about the\nprogress.\n\n15. On a perusal of the report filed by the prosecutor and\nalso on considering the impugned order in the light of the\nprinciples laid down in the above two decisions, I am satisfied\nthat the order granting extension of time is legally tenable and\ndoes not warrant any interference.\n\nAccordingly, I find no merit in this Crl.M.C and it is\ndismissed.\n\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\nAJM\n\nBSR Eh\n= eM\nsd te\nBeer\n2024/KER/4083\nCRL.MC NO. 110 OF 2024\n8\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 1130/2024\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES\nAnnexure At TRUE COPY OF THE FIR IN CRIME NO.\n391/2022 OF KASABA POLICE STATION,\nPALAKKAD\nAnnexure A2 TRUE COPY OF THE REPORT DATED\n21.11.2023 NUMBERED AS CRL.M.P NO.\n5721/2023 SUBMITTED BY THE PUBLIC\nPROSECUTOR U/S 36A (4) OF NDPS ACT\nAnnexure 3 TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER DATED\n29.11.2023 IN CRL.M.P NO. 5721/2023\nPASSED BY THE COURT OF SESSIONS,\nPALAKKAD\nTRUE COPY\n\n"
