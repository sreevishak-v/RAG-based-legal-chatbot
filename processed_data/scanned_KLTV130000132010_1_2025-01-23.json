Thereafter the case was posted for defence evidence. No defence\nevidence was adduced from the side of the accused No.5.\n\n7. Heard both sides and perused records.\n\n8. The following points have arisen for determination:\n\n1. Whether accused Nos. 1 to 5 were formed an unlawful assembly in\nprosecution of their common object, and accused No.5 became a member of\nthat assembly, on 14.09.1997, at about 9.00 pm, at the lane near\nThampanoor Bus Stand and thereby committed an offence u/s.143 of Indian\nPenal Code 1860 ?\n\n2. Whether on the same day at the same time and place, accused No.5 in\nprosecution of their common object, committed the offence of rioting along\nwith accused Nos. 1 to 4 and have thereby committed offence punishable\nunder section 147 read with 149 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 ?\n\n5 of 8\n\n3.

If the accused is found guilty? What is the order of the sentence?\n\n9, Point Nos. 1 to 5 :-To avoid repetition and for brevity, point numbers 1 to 5 are\nconsidered together. Prosecution case is that the accused has committed\noffences punishable under sections 143, 147, 148, 149, 341, 427 and 506(ii) of\nIndian Penal Code, 1860.\n\n10. Evidence adduced by the prosecution:- PW1 S.Suresh Kumar had conducted\nthe investigation of the above case .He deposed that he had prepared the Ext P1\n\n6 of 8\n\nscene mahasar cum vehicle mahasar and subsequently the vehicle was released\nto the interim custody of CW1 as per Ext 2 receipt _He further admitted the\nreport as to the identity of the accused persons which was marked as Ext P3 .\n\n11.PW2 Abdul Rashi was filed the final report before the court .PW3 Sanal\nKumar was GD in charge on the alleged day of incident in Thampanoor police\nstation .He deposed that asper the statement given by CW1 he registered Ext\nP4 FIR .In his cross examination he deposed that the FIR was registered on the\nnext day after the incident and the identity of the accused persons were not\nstated .\n\n12.Submission made by learned counsel for the accused:- The learned counsel\nsubmitted that the person who sustained loss had not been examined by the\nprosecution, hence accused is entitled to get acquittal.\n\n13.Submission_made_ by learned Assistant Public_Prosecutor:- The learned\nAssistant Public Prosecutor submitted that the evidence of PW1 to PW3 are\nsufficient to prove the guilt of the accused persons. The leamed Assistant\nPublic Prosecutor had given up other witnesses and he is justified in doing so\n\n7 of 8\n\nsince it is reported that the presence of the material witnesses cannot be\nprocured in the near future .\n\n14.Evaluation of evidence: - In order to fasten the liability of accused no.5, the\nprosecution has to prove that the accused no.5 was also a member of unlawful\nassembly and he committed mishief in prosecution of common object of that\nassembly. The person who had sustained the loss there is no occular witness.\nhad not been examined by the prosecution. On analysis of the evidence of\nprosecution it can be seen that there is no direct evidence to prove that the\naccused has committed the offence as alleged by the prosecution .Having\nconsidered evidence on record, this court is of the view that prosecution has\nfailed to prove the guilt of the accused. For the said reason these points are\nfound against the prosecution.\n\n15.Point No. 6 :- Upon the finding in point nos. 1 to 5, the accused No.5 is found\nnot guilty of offences punishable under sections 143, 147, 148, 149, 427 and\n506(ii) of Indian Penal Code, 1860 and he is acquitted for the said offences\nunder section 248(1) Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.
