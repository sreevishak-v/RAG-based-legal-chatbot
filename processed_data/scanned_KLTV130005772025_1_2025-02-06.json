This is the petition filed u/s. 480 of BNSS 2023 by the petitioner / accused in\nCrime No. 22/2025 of Mannanthala Police Station.\n\n2. Offence alleged against the petitioner / accused is U/s. 420 of Indian Penal\nCode, 1860.\n\n3. Zhe prosecution case in brief as follows:- The accused who was the servant in\nthe hotel run by the informant with dishonest intention obtained Rs. 6, 25,000/-\nfrom the informant on various dates and thereafter absconded. â€˜Thus the\naccused has committed offences punishable U/s. 420 of Indian Penal Code,\n1860.\n\n4. Petitioner/accused was arrested and produced before this court on 22.01.2025.\nSince then he has been in judicial custody. Thus this petition.\n\n5. Areport was called for from SHO, Mannanthala police station. Report filed by\nthe SHO Mannanthala Police Station dated 05.02.2025 stating that the investi-\ngation in the above case is going on and if accused is enlarged on bail he may\n\n2\nflee from justice and also there is a chance that the evidence will be tampered.\n6. Heard both sides. The following point has arisen for consideration ?\nIs the petitioner /accused entitled to be released on bail ?\n\n7. Point :- The petitioner submits that he is innocent hence entitled to be re-\nleased on bail.\n\n8. Submission made by the learned counsel for the accused:- The learned\ncounsel for the accused submitted that accused is innocent and the matter is\nsettled between the parties.\n\n9. Submission made by the learned Assistant Public Prosecutor:- The\nlearned Assistant Public Prosecutor submitted that the accused has absconded\nafter the incident and if he released there is likelihood of him being absconded.\nHence this application has to be rejected. Further submitted that his custody is\nrequired for investigation.\n\n10. The Honourable Apex Court in P Chidambaram v. Directorate of Enforce-\nment 2020 AIR SC 1699 held that \"The jurisdiction to grant bail has to be\nexercised on the basis of the well - settled principles having regard to the\nfacts and circumstances of each case. The following factors are to be taken\ninto consideration while considering an application for bail: - (i) the nature\nof accusation and the severity of the punishment in the case of conviction\nand the nature of materials relied upon by the prosecution; (ii) reasonable\napprehension of tampering with the witnesses or apprehension of threat to\nthe complainant or the witnesses; (iii) reasonable possibility of securing the\npresence of the accused at the time of trial or the likelihood of his abscon-\ndence; (iv) character behaviour and standing of the accused and the circum-\nstances which are peculiar to the accused; (v) larger interest of the public or\nthe State and similar other considerations (vide Prahlad Singh Bhati v. NCT,\nDelhi and another 2001 (4) SCC 280. There is no hard and fast rule regard-\ning grant or refusal to grant bail. Each case has to be considered on the facts\nand circumstances of each case and on its own merits.\n\n3\n\n11. I have heard contentions of both parties and perused the records of prosecution.\nWhile analysing to the fact of the case, it can be seen that the allegations\nlevelled against the accused is serious in nature, the investigation is at the\ninitial stage and custody of the accused is required for effective investigation.\nHence considering the facts and circumstances of the case, stage of\ninvestigation, nature of the allegations made against the accused and in the\nlight of judgments of Honourable Apex Court this court is of the view that\nfurther detention of the accused is required and hence he is not entitled to be\nreleased on bail at this stage. Hence, I am not inclined to allow the bail\n\napplication .\n\nAs aresult, this bail application is dismissed .\nDictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected by me and\npronounced by me in open court on this the 6\" day of February, 2025.\nSd/-\nJudicial First Class Magistrate-V,\nThiruvananthapuram.\n//True copy//\n\n"
