JUSTICE SOPHY THOMAS\nMONDAY, THE 8â„¢ DAY OF JANUARY 2024 / 18TH POUSHA, 1945\nCRL.MC NO. 108 OF 2024\nCRIME NO.861/2016 OF Museum Police Station, Thiruvananthapuram\nPETITIONER/ACCUSED NO.1:\nANIL KUMAR K AGED 39 YEARS S/O GOPALAN, OCEAN GEMS &\nPEARLS, OPP: STYLE PLUS, KESTON ROAD, KOWDIYAR,\nTHIRUVANANTHAPURAM DISTRICT, PIN - 695003\nBY ADV SOJAN MICHEAL\nRESPONDENTS /COMPLAINANT:\nSTATE OF KERALA REPRESENTED BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR, HIGH\nCOURT OF KERALA, PIN - 682031\nSR.PP-SRI.RENJIT GEORGE\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n08.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nape\n2024/KER/1574\nCrl.M.C. NO.108 OF 2024\n2\nORDER\n\nDated this the 8\" day of January , 2024\n\nThis Crl.M.C., under Section 482 of Cr.P.C., is\nfiled by the first accused in C.C.No.1404 of 2016, on the\nfile of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-III,\nThiruvananthapuram, to direct the Magistrate to recall the\narrest warrant pending against him and to release the\npetitioner on bail, in the event of his appearance/surrender\nbefore that court.\n\n2. The petitioner herein is alleged to have\ncommitted offences punishable under Sections 354, 451,\n323 and 506(ii) r/w Section 34 of IPC. He got anticipatory\nbail from this Court as early as on 23.06.2016. But it\nseems that, he did not appear before the Investigating\nOfficer, to execute the bond as directed by this Court, in\nthe order dated 23.06.2016. Now he is intending to\nsurrender before the learned Magistrate and his request is\nto direct the Magistrate to recall the warrant and to release\n\napa\n2024/KERIN574\nCri.M.C. NO.108 OF 2024\n3\nhim on bail when he surrenders before that court.\n\n3. The case is of the year 2016. The petitioner,\nafter getting anticipatory bail, did not even care to execute\nthe bond, as directed by this Court. His case is that he did\nnot get summons from the court and so he failed to\nappear before the learned Magistrate. Now this Court is\nnot in a_ position to verify the genuineness of his\ncontentions. So, the petitioner can appear/surrender in\nC.C.No.1404 of 2016 pending before Judicial First Class\nMagistrate Court-III, Thiruvananthapuram. In case, he\nmakes a application for bail, learned Magistrate has to\nconsider and pass appropriate orders in that petition, on\nthe date of appearance/surrender itself, as far as, possible.\n\nWith these directions, this Crl.M.C. is disposed of.\nSd/-\nSOPHY THOMAS\nJUDGE\nSSK/08/01\n\nae\npeat es\n2024/KER/1574\nCrl.M.C.
