The petition averments in brief is as follows:-That on 03.01.2024 the\npetitioner fell to an online financial fraud where a total sum of Rs. 1,83,100/-\nwas extorted from her bank account, bearing the A/c No. 0464053000003549,\nSouth Indian Bank (Branch). While so, being brainwashed by them, she\ninvested money in two different bank accounts bearing A/c. Nos.\n20260100200589 and 230801000011605. Soon after sending the money, there\nwas no further communication from these so called investment groups. The\npolice authorities were able to trace and recover part of the amount. Now the\npartly traced defrauded amount of Rs. 50,000/- is now in Jammu and Kashmir\nBank, Haider Beigh bearing A/c No. 05270101000001035 and IFSC Code\nJAKAOHBEIGH and to direct the local branch of Jammu and Kashmir Bank in\nThiruvananthapuram to take necessary steps to facilitate the same within a\n\n2 Of 3\nstipulated time.

Report filed stating no objection to the release of\nRs.Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand Only) to the petitioner. In the report\nit is stating that petitioner is entitled to the money.\n\n4. Heard both sides and perused the records .The following point has arisen for\nconsideration .\n\nIs the petitioner entitled to the interim custody of the sum of Rs.50,000/-\n(Rupees Fifty Thousand Only) ?\n5. The point : The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the money is\nbelongs to the petitioner and she is entitled to get the amount.\n6. The learned APP submitted no objection in releasing the money.\n7. I have heard the contentions of both sides. As per the report of SHO, the money\nclaimed by the petition is belongs to her and it is not needed for any other purpose.\nNo case is registered so far.\n8. Hon’ble High Court in Madhu K v. Sub Inspector of Police and others reported\nin 2020(5) KHC 35 held that in case the seizure u/s.102 of Cr.PC is illegal and the\naccount freezed lacked direct link with the offence alleged, the legal remedy open to\nthe aggrieved is to approach the Magistrate concemed wu/s.451 or 457 of Cr.PC and\nseek to get the account de-freezed. But if the freezing is per say contrary to the\nprovisions of law the aggrieved person can approach the High Court. In the present\ncase even though there is no material to show that the search was illegal, but the\ninvestigating officer had reported that the amount belongs to the applicant and if it\nremains “ON HOLD” it will cause irreparable injury to the applicant.\n\n3 OfF3\n9. In the light of above judgment and considering the facts of case I am of the view\nthat the petition is fit to be allowed. Hence, I am inclined to allow this application.\nAs a result, CMP is allowed on following conditions.\n\n(1) The applicant shall execute a bond for %. 50,000/- with two solvent\nsureties for like sum.\n\n(2) The applicant shall produce before this court or superior court the sum\nequivalent to ~. 50,000/- as and when directed by this court or superior\ncourt.\n\n(3) The investigating officer shall take immediate steps to release the\namount to the petitioner and the Bank officials of Jammu and Kashmir\nBank, Haider Beigh may also take immediate steps to release the\namount to the applicant as per the procedure.\n\nDictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected by me and\npronounced by me in open court on this the 16\" day of January, 2025\n//True copy// Sd/-\nJudicial First Class Magistrate-V,\nThiruvananthapuram.\n\n"
