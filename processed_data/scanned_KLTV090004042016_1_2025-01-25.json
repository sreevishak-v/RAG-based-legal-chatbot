The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: Accused was the driver of\nthe KSRTC bus bearing Registration No. TS-804. He drove the vehicle through\nPalayam overbridge rashly, negligent and in a manner so as to endanger human\nlife and at high speed through about 9:45 pm on 18.09.2013 and hit on the\nbackside of the motorcycle bearing Registration No. KL 19 D 2564 which was\ndriven by the Informant, in the same direction. Due to its impact, the Informant\nfell down on the road and sustained serious injury to his left side of head. Further\nhe also sustained fracture in his right leg and left ankle, injuries on his left\nshoulder and elbow. Thus, the Accused is thereby alleged to have committed the\nabove stated offences.\n3. This Court took cognizance in respect of offences under Sections 279, 337\nand 338 of the IPC and took the case on file. On issuance of process, the Accused\n\n3\nentered appearance. He was enlarged on bail. He was represented by a Counsel of\nhis own choice. Copies of all relevant prosecution records were furnished to him.\nThe particulars of offence under Sections 279, 337, 338 of the IPC were read over\nand explained to him, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.\nThough the Accused did not turn up before this Court subsequently and steps\neffected against him, he appeared thereafter with fresh solvent sureties and got\nenlarged on bail.\n4. From the side of Prosecution, CWs1 and 2 were examined as PWs 1 and 2\nrespectively and Exhibit P1 marked. The remaining witnesses were given up by\nthe Learned APP as the material witnesses turned hostile to the case of\nProsecution. Since no incriminating circumstances arose from the depositions of\nthe witnesses, the examination of the Accused under Section 313(1)(b) of the CrPC\nwas dispensed with. No Defence evidence was adduced.\n5. Heard both sides and perused relevant documents. The following points\narise for consideration.\na. Has the Accused driven the aforesaid vehicle rashly, negligently in a\nmanner endangering the life of PW1, causing injury to him and thereby\ncommitted the offence punishable under Section 279 of the IPC as alleged?\nb. Has the Accused driven the aforesaid vehicle in the said manner and\ncaused hurt to PW1 and thereby committed the offence punishable under\nSection 337 IPC as alleged?\n\n4\n\nCc. Has the Accused by so driving the aforesaid vehicle in the manner\n\naforesaid caused grievous hurt to PW1 and thereby committed the offence\n\npunishable under Section 338 of the IPC as alleged?\n\nd. If so, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded?\n\n6. Points a to c: These points are considered together for the sake of brevity\nand to repetition.\n\nPW1 deposed that he sustained injury in the incident occurred on\n18.09.2013 near Secretariat. According to him, KSRTC Bus had hit on the\nbackside of his motor cycle while he was travelling in a bike. He deposed that he\ngave Exhibit P1 Statement to the police. However, he denied identification of the\nbus, the depo, the reason for the incident and further deposed that he had not seen\nthe person who allegedly drove the vehicle.\n\nPW2 deposed that he lives in Neyyatinakara. He knows the PW1. The\nincident took place in front of the Secretariat on 18.09.2013 by around 10:00PM.\nPWI1 was riding a bike in front of him. He was travelling from Kizhakkekotta to\nSecretariat. One KSRTC bus hit on the backside of PW1’s bike and PWI1 fell near\ndivider on the road. PW1 was taken to the hospital in an ambulance and he\nfollowed the ambulance. He denied identification of the bus, the reason for the\nincident and further the person who allegedly drove the vehicle. He also denied to\nhave given statement to the police to the effect that the incident occurred on\naccount of the negligence and carelessness of the driver of the bus.\n\n5\n\nOn going through the evidence and the materials on record, it is pertinent to\nnote that though PW1 admits of having sustained injuries in the incident, he has no\ncase that it was on account of rash or negligent driving of the Accused. In fact,\nPW1 categorically deposed that he does not know the Accused and has no case\nthat it was the Accused who had so driven the vehicle as alleged by the\nProsecution so as to implicate him. PW2, one of the occurrence witnesses also\ndenied having witnessed the incident and turned hostile to the Prosecution. The\nremaining witnesses were given up by the Prosecution as the material witnesses\nhad turned hostile to the Prosecution and also no purpose would be served in\nexamining the remaining witnesses in the said circumstance. Thus, there is\nnothing on record as revealed from the deposition of the witnesses so as to\nimplicate the Accused to the alleged incident that the Accused by the aforesaid\nacts committed the above offences, having caused PW1 to sustain injuries. The\nProsecution has thus failed to substantiate its case by adducing proper evidence\nand thereby failed to prove the guilt of the Accused beyond reasonable doubt.\nHence these points are found in favour of the Accused.\n9. Point d: In light of analysis of the points hereinabove, since those are found\nin favour of the Accused, no sentence is to be awarded to the Accused.\n10. In the result, the Accused is found not guilty of having committed the\noffence punishable under Sections 279, 337 and 338 of the Indian Penal Code,\n1860. Hence, the Accused is acquitted of the said offence under section 255(1) of\nCrPC. His bail bond stands canceled and he is set at liberty.\n\n6\n(Dictated to my Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected by\nme and pronounced in open court on this the 25\" day of January, 2025)\nJudicial Magistrate of First Class-I\nThiruvananthapuram\nAPPENDIX\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA: Prosecution witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nPW1 Rahul R S(CW1) examined |Injured and Occurrence\non 23.11.2020 Witness\nPW2 Hari (CW2) examined on |Occurrence Witness\n20.01.2025\nB: Defence witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nC: Court witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\n\n7\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA.
