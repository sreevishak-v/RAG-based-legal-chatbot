Sanoj R Nair)\nRespondent : Sreenivasan, S/o. Padmanabhan,\nKunnumpurathu Veedu, Pullekonam,\nKaryavattom P O, thiruvananthapuram-695 581\nOrder Accused is discharged under Section 245(2) of\nthe CrPC of the above offences under\nSections 323, and 506(ii) of the IPC r/w Section\n31 of the DV Act.\nThis case having come up for consideration before this Court on 18.11.2024,\nthis Court on the same day passes the following:\nORDER\n1. This case arose on a Private Complaint filed by the Complainant alleging\ncommission of the offences under Sections 323, and 506(ii) of the IPC r/w Section 31\nof the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (hereinafter referred to\nas the ‘DV Act’) against the Accused person, who is the husband of the Complainant.\nThe Complaint was taken on file against Accused for the above offences vide Order\nof this Court dated 21.05.2022.\n2. This case is in the stage of pre-charge enquiry, i.e., posted evidence of\nComplainant under Section 244 CrPC since 30.01.2024. On 31.05.2024, though the\n\n2\n\nComplainant was represented, time was granted for adducing the evidence. The\nComplainant was absent continuously on subsequent postings, i.e., on 08.08.2024,\n24.08.2024, 19.10.2024, 15.11.2024 and finally on 18.11.2024. However, the Accused\nwas duly represented by his Counsel and he was present as well. Notice was issued\nto the Complainant on 24.08.2024 and on account of her non-appearance registered\nnotice was issued on 19.10.2024 requiring her appearance before this Court and\nintitmating the next posting date. On 15.11.2024, the Acknowledgment Card returned\nserved with the sign and name of the Complainant. A fair opportunity was however\ngranted for her appearance further and the case was adjourned as ‘No Further Time’\nto 18.11.2024 and notice also issued to the Counsel appearing on her behalf. On the\nsaid date, the Learned Counsel for the Complainant submitted that he no more holds\nher Vakalat and the Complainant was also absent. The Accused was present before\nthis Court.\n\n3. It is pertinent to note that despite having granted sufficient opportunities to\nthe Complainant to adduce evidence as elucidated above, when the matter was taken\nup this day, the Complainant remained absent. There was no representation for the\nComplainant and the Counsel submitted that he no more appears on behalf of the\nComplainant. The Accused was present and represented by their Counsel. Neither is\nthe Complainant present before this Court nor is she represented by her Counsel and\nno bonafide reason stated for the non-appearance of the Complainant.\n\nIt is well settled that a Complainant seeking to formulate a charge against\naccused is bound to adduce evidence in support of his case at the stage of pre -\ncharge enquiry since evidence already recorded by the Court under Sections 200 and.\n202 of CrPC is not admissible in evidence nor binding on the Accused. Neglect of the\ncomplainant to proceed with the enquiry and adduce evidence must be reckoned by\nthe Magistrate to be a situation where the complainant lacked necessary materials in\nsupport of accusation and therefore the proposed charge is groundless. (See\nRahmath v. State of Kerala and Others, 2020 (4) KHC 90)\n\n3\n\nFrom a careful consideration of the records in this case and the conduct of the\nComplainant, it appears to this Court that the Complainant does not intend to\nproceed with the above matter. This Court is satisfied the Complainant has neglected\nto participate in the pre-charge enquiry despite umpteen opportunities granted to\nhim to adduce evidence in support of his case and that he has failed, for no good\nreasons in adducing the evidence requisite for formulating charge against the\nAccused. The reason for his non-appearance is unexplained. Even if it is taken into\naccount that she is no more represented by the Counsel who held her vakalat,\naccording to his submission; it is seen that despite having served with the notice,\nthere is non-appearance on the part of the Complainant before this Court.\n\nIn wake of above circumstances, this Court does not find any other reason to\nproceed with the matter further, as continuation of the proceeding any longer, in\nabsence of Complainant at this stage would remain only a futile exercise and would\ncause serious prejudice to the Accused. The neglect on part of the Complainant to\nadduce evidence under Section 244 CrPC when read in conjunction with the\nunexplained reason for his absence can only lead to the conclusion that she lacks\nmaterials in support of his accusation and that the proposed charge is groundless.\nHence the Accused persons are discharged of the aforesaid offences under Section\n245(2) of the CrPC.\n\n4. Resultantly, the Accused is discharged under Section 245(2) of the CrPC of the\nabove offences under Sections 323, and 506(ii) of the IPC r/w Section 31 of the DV\nAct.\nPronounced in open court on this the 18% day of November, 2024.\nJudicial Magistrate of First Class -I,\nThiruvananthapuram.\n\n"
