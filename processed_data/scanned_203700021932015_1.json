The above\ncase was initiated on the basis of a private complaint\nfiled by the second respondent as CMP No.1740/2014.\nThe second respondent is the de facto complainant in\nthe above case. After taking cognizance under Section\n190 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, all the disputes\nbetween the petitioners and the second respondent\nwere settled in the mediation held at the District\nMediation Centre, Ernakulam. As per the terms of\nmediation, both parties agreed to withdraw all the\ncases filed by both against each other before all\ncourts. Now the second respondent has no subsisting\ngrievance against the petitioners and she do not\nintend to proceed with the criminal case.

Both the counsel urged for\nquashing the entire proceedings under Annexure—Al\ncomplaint invoking inherent jurisdiction under\nSection 482 of the Cr.P.C.\n\n3. The learned counsel for the petitioners drew\nmy attention to the decision laid down by the Apex\nCourt in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108\n(SC)] in support of his arguments.\n\n4. I have meticulously considered the decision\nlaid down in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT\n108 (SC)]. In the above case, three Judge Bench of the\nApex Court, on a reference, considered the question\nwhether the High Court has power to quash criminal\n\nan\npiekkee\n2015/KER/17254\nCrl.M.C.2193/14-C 23:\nproceedings involving non-compoundable offences on\nthe basis of the compromise reached between the\noffender and the victim and answered as given below:\n“BT. The position that emerges from the\nabove discussion can be summarised thus:\nthe power of the High Court in quashing a\ncriminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in\nexercise of its inherent jurisdiction is\ndistinct and different from the power given\nto a criminal court for compounding the\noffences under §.320 of the Code. Inherent\npower is of wide plenitude with no statutory\nlimitation but it has to be exercised in\naccord with the guideline engrafted in such\npower viz:(i) to secure the ends of justice or\n(ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any\nCourt. In what cases power to quash the\ncriminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.\nmay be exercised where the offender and\nvictim have settled their dispute would\ndepend on the facts and circumstances of\neach case and no category can be prescribed.\nHowever, before exercise of such power, the\nHigh Court must have due regard to the\nnature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and\nserious offences of mental depravity or\noffences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc.,\ncannot be fittingly quashed",

I have meticulously considered the decision\nlaid down in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT\n108 (SC)]. In the above case, three Judge Bench of the\nApex Court, on a reference, considered the question\nwhether the High Court has power to quash criminal\n\nan\npiekkee\n2015/KER/17254\nCrl.M.C.2193/14-C 23:\nproceedings involving non-compoundable offences on\nthe basis of the compromise reached between the\noffender and the victim and answered as given below:\n“BT. The position that emerges from the\nabove discussion can be summarised thus:\nthe power of the High Court in quashing a\ncriminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in\nexercise of its inherent jurisdiction is\ndistinct and different from the power given\nto a criminal court for compounding the\noffences under §.320 of the Code. Inherent\npower is of wide plenitude with no statutory\nlimitation but it has to be exercised in\naccord with the guideline engrafted in such\npower viz:(i) to secure the ends of justice or\n(ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any\nCourt. In what cases power to quash the\ncriminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.\nmay be exercised where the offender and\nvictim have settled their dispute would\ndepend on the facts and circumstances of\neach case and no category can be prescribed.\nHowever, before exercise of such power, the\nHigh Court must have due regard to the\nnature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and\nserious offences of mental depravity or\noffences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc.,\ncannot be fittingly quashed even though the\nvictim or victim's family and the offender\nhave settled the dispute. Such offences are\nnot private in nature and have serious\nimpact on society. Similarly, any\ncompromise between the victim and offender\nin relation to the offences under special\nstatutes like Prevention of Corruption Act\nor the offences committed by public\nservants while working in that capacity etc:\ncannot provide for any basis for quashing\n\nan\nBae\n2015/KER/17254\n\nCrl.M.C.2193/14-C 24:\n\ncriminal proceedings involving such\n\noffences. But the criminal cases having\n\noverwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil\n\nflavour stand on different footing for the\n\npurposes of quashing, particularly the\n\noffences arising from commercial, financial,\n\nmercantile, civil, partnership or such like\n\ntransactions or the offences arising out of\n\nmatrimony relating to dowry. etc., or the\n\nfamily disputes where the wrong is basically\n\nprivate or personal in nature and the parties\n\nhave resolved their entire dispute. In this\n\ncategory of cases, High Court may quash\n\ncriminal proceedings if in its view, because\n\nof the compromise between the offender and\n\nvictim, the possibility of conviction is\n\nremote, bleak and continuation of criminal\n\ncase would put accused to great oppression\n\nand prejudice and extreme injustice would be\n\ncaused to him by not quashing the criminal\n\ncase despite full and complete settlement\n\nand compromise with the victim. In other\n\nwords, the High Court must consider whether\n\nit would be unfair or contrary to the\n\ninterest of justice to continue with the\n\ncriminal proceeding or continuation of the\n\ncriminal proceeding would tantamount to\n\nabuse of process of law despite settlement\n\nand compromise between the victim and\n\nwrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of\n\njustice, it is appropriate that criminal case\n\nis put to an end and if the answer to the\n\nabove question(s) is in affirmative, the High\n\nCourt shall be well within its jurisdiction to\n\nquash the criminal proceeding.”\n\n5. In view of the proposition laid down above, the\n\nquestion to be considered, in the instant case, is,\nwhether the non-compoundable offence involved in\n\naa\n2015/KER/IN7254\n\nCrl.M.C.2193/14-C 5:\n\nthis case can be compounded, in the exercise of the\ninherent power under Section 482 of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure. Prima facie, I find that the\noffences alleged against the petitioners will not\ncome under the category of non-compoundable\noffences, which are specifically excluded from\ncomposition, in the exercise of inherent power under\nSec.482 of the Cr.P.C. Going by the affidavit filed by\nthe de facto complainant, it is seen that the dispute\nbetween the accused and the victim had been amicably\nsettled and at present the de facto complainant has\nno subsisting grievance at all. The de facto\ncomplainant does not want to proceed with\nprosecution against the accused. Full and final\nsettlement and compromise with the victim are\nevidenced by Annexure—-A%3. In view of the compromise\nbetween the first petitioner and the victim, I find\nthat the possibility of conviction is remote, bleak,\nand continuation of the criminal case would put the\nparties to great oppression, prejudice and also\n\nail\nrrasaehas a\n2015/KER/17254\nCrL.M.C.2193/14-C 26:\ntantamount to abuse of the process of the court. The\npresent criminal prosecution against the accused\nmust be put to an end to secure the interest of\njustice.\n6. In this analysis, the prosecution proceedings\nagainst the petitioners under Annexure—-Al complaint\nin C.C. No.1386/2014 on the files of the Judicial First\nClass Magistrate's Court-II, Ernakulam will stand\nquashed.\nThis petition is allowed.\nSd/-\n(K.HARILAL, JUDGE)\nokb.\n//True copy//\nP.A. to Judge\n\n"
