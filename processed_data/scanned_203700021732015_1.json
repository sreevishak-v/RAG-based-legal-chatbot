RAMAKRISHNAN, J.\nDated this the 24\" day of April, 2015.\nORDER\n\nThis is a petition filed by the petitioner challenging the\norder in Crl.M.P.No.615/2014 in Crl.A.No.247/2014 on the file\nof the First Additional Sessions Court, Mavelikara under\nsection 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\n2. It is alleged in the petition that the first respondent\nherein filed M.C.No.15/2012 before the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate Court-1, Chengannur under section 12 of the\nProtection of Women from Domestic Violence Act claiming\nmaintenance and other reliefs. The learned magistrate allowed\nthe application in part and passed an ex parte order, against\nwhich, the petitioner filed Crl.A.No.247/14 before the Sessions\nCourt, Alappuzha with delay condonation application, which was\nmade over to the First Additional Sessions Court, Mavelikara\nfor disposal and he filed Crl.M.P.No.615/2014 for suspending\nthe order passed by the court below and the learned First\nAdditional Sessions Judge earlier passed an order directing the\npetitioner to deposit Rs.1,000/- per month from 13.12.2014.\n\nBRpetahl\n2015/KER/17317\nCrl.M.C.No.2173 of 2015 2\nThereafter the petition was advanced and the date was\ncorrected from 13.2.2012 onwards and posted the case to\n15.1.2015. This order is being challenged by the petitioner by\nfiling this petition.\n\n3. On going through the allegations, this Court felt that\nthere is no necessity to interfere with the order and so decided\nto dispose of the matter on admission itself dispensing with\nnotice to the first respondent after hearing the counsel for the\npetitioner and the Public Prosecutor.\n\n4. The counsel for the petitioner submitted that his\ngrievance was that he was not liable to pay maintenance, but\nthe lower court passed an _ ex parte order which is being\nchallenged by the petitioner and earlier the First Additional\nSessions Judge has directed to deposit only Rs.1,000/- per month\nfrom 13.12.2014, but later it was corrected as 13.2.2012,\nwhich, according to the learned counsel for the petitioner, is\nnot correct.\n\n5. Heard the Public Prosecutor, Smt.M.T. Sheeba as well.\n\n6. It is seen from the order that the lower court had\ndirected the petitioner to pay maintenance at the rate of\nRs.2,500/- per month from the date of petition namely 13.2.2012\n\nBRpetahl\n2015/KER/17317\n\nCrl.M.C.No.2173 of 2015 3\n\nand it was an ex parte order. This was challenged by the\npetitioner by filing appeal with delay condonation application\nand after delay was condoned, the learned First Additional\nSessions Judge inclined to stay execution of clause (b) of the\nimpugned order on condition of depositing Rs.1,000/- per\nmonth from 13.12.2014 and it appears to be a mistake. When\nthis was realized, the learned First Additional Sessions Judge\nafter giving notice, suo motu advanced the petition, and since\n\nno objection was filed, the learned First Additional Sessions\nJudge corrected the date as 13.2.2012 because the appellate\ncourt had reduced the order of maintenance to be paid to\nRs.1,000/- from the date of petition as ordered by the court\nbelow which cannot be said to be illegal. So there is no\nnecessity to interfere with the order passed by the court below\n\nas no illegality has been committed by the court below in this\nregard.\n\n7. While this Court was about to dispose of the petition,\nthe counsel for the petitioner submitted that a direction may\nbe given to the lower court to dispose of the appeal itself\nwithin time bound manner. Considering the legislative intention\nof enacting the provision and also considering the mandate\n\nEL el\n2015/KER/17317\n\nCrl.M.C.No.2173 of 2015 4\nprovided under the Statute to dispose of the cases filed under\nthe Act at the earliest time under section 12 of the Act itself,\nthis Court feels that the First Additional Sessions Judge,\nMavelikara can be directed to dispose of the appeal itself as\nearly as possible, at any rate, within three months from the date\nof re-opening the court after summer vacation. The petitioner\nis granted one months time to deposit the amount as directed\nby the court below. Till then, coercive steps, if any, taken as\ndirected to be kept in abeyance. The Additional Sessions\nJudge, Mavelikkara is directed to dispose of the appeal itself\nas directed above.\n\nWith the above directions and observations, this petition is\ndisposed of.\n\nSd/-\nK.
