CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION\nON 17.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE\nFOLLOWING:\n\nPee\nCrl.M.C.No.484/2024 2\neases\n2024/KER/4001\nORDER\n\nThis Crl.M.C. under Section 482 of CrP.C. is at the\ninstance of the complainant in Annexure-A2 complaint on\nthe file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, North\nParavur, for quashing Annexure-Al order dated 08.12.2023\nand to forward Annexure-A2 complaint to SHO, Vadakkekara\nPolice Station for investigation under Section 156(3) of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973.\n\n2. The petitioner filed a private complaint, against the\nrespondents therein, as MP No.5998 of 2023, alleging that\nthey deployed minor school children for collecting amounts\nfor the centenary celebrations of SNMHS, Moothakunnam.\nHis prayer in the complaint was to forward the complaint for\ninvestigation to SHO, Vadakkekara, under Section 156(3) of\nCrP.C. But as per Annexure-Al order, learned Magistrate\nposted it for taking sworn statement of the petitioner/\ncomplainant, stating that, investigation by the Police was not\nnecessary.\n\nPee\nCrl.M.C.No.484/2024 3\neases\n2024/KER/4001\n3. Learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that\nseveral documents are to be collected and witnesses are to\nbe questioned and that has to be done only through proper\ninvestigation done by Police. So, it was absolutely necessary\nto get the investigation done through SHO, Vadakkekara\nPolice Station, and Annexure-Ail order, by which, the MP was\nposted for sworn statement of the petitioner, and also the\nfinding that investigation by Police was not necessary, are\nliable to be set aside.\n4. Adverting to the facts and circumstances, and also\non hearing the submissions made at the Bar, this Court is of\nthe view that Annexure-A2 complaint filed by the\ncomplainant ought to have been forwarded to SHO,\nVadakkekara Police Station, for investigation and report.\nLearned Magistrate, without assigning any specific reasons,\ncould not have jumped into a conclusion that investigation\nby Police was not necessary, when the case of the\ncomplainant was that several documents have to be\ncollected and several witnesses were to be questioned to\n\nae\nCrl.M.C.No.484/2024 4 Sa Ge\n2024/KER/4001\nbring out the real state of affairs. So this Court is inclined to\nset aside Annexure-Al order dated 08.12.2023 and to direct\nthe learned Magistrate to forward Annexure-A2 complaint to\nSHO, Vadakkekara Police Station for investigation and\nreport.\nThe Crl.M.C. stands allowed accordingly.\nSd/-\nSOPHY THOMAS\nJUDGE\nDSV/-\n\nBakes\nCrl.M.C.No.484/2024 5 sat\n2024/KER/4001\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 484/2024\n\nPETITIONER’S ANNEXURES :\n\nAnnexure Al THE TRUE SCANNED COPY OF THE ORDER DATED\n08.12.2023 IN M.P.NO.5998 OF 2023 OF THE\nJUDICIAL FIRST CLASS MAGISTRATE COURT-I, NORTH\nPARAVUR.\n\nAnnexure A2 THE TRUE SCANNED COPY OF PRIVATE COMPLAINT\nDATED 08.12.2023 PREFERRED BY THE PETITIONER\nBEFORE THE JUDICIAL FIRST CLASS MAGISTRATE\nCOURT-I, NORTH PARAVUR.\n\nAnnexure A3 THE TRUE COPY OF THE REPORT NO.V4/1720140\n/2022/DGE OF THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR, DIRECTORATE\nOF GENERAL EDUCATION OBTAINED BY THE\nPETITIONER/COMPLAINT UNDER THE RIGHT TO\nINFORMATION ACT, 2005.\n\nRESPONDENT’ S ANNEXURES : NIL\n\n"
