CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n10.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nOo\neae\n2024/KER/2380\nCRL.MC NO. 196 OF 2024\n2\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.\n~ GrLLM.C.No.196 of 2024\nDated this the 10\" day of January, 2024\nORDER\n\nPetitioners are accused Nos.1 to 3 in C.C.No.414 of 2020 on the\nfiles of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Thamarassery alleging\noffences under Sections 341 and 323 r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal\nCode, 1860.\n\n2. According to the prosecution, on 12.03.2020 at about 5.50 a.m.,\nwhile the defacto complainant was proceeding in a motor bike, the\naccused intercepted him and dashed against his bike using a car and\nthereafter assaulted him. While the 2™ respondent tore the shirt of the\ndefacto complainant, the 3 accused restrained the defacto complainant\nand thereby the accused committed the offences alleged.\n\n3. Sri.N.K.Shyju, the learned counsel for the petitioners submitted\nthat even going by the prosecution case as revealed from the statement\nof the complainant and other witnesses, the offences as alleged are not\nmade out. The learned counsel relied upon two statements given by the\ndefacto complainant on 12.03.2020 and 13.03.2020 and pointed out that\ndiscrepancy in the two statements is clearly evident indicating the falsity\nof the prosecution case. It was further submitted that, if the trial is\npermitted to take place, the same would cause great prejudice and hence\nSection 482 Cr.P.C. ought to be invoked to quash the proceedings.\n\noh ets\nBSR eer\n2024/KER/2380\nCRL.MC NO. 196 OF 2024\n3\n\n4. I have heard Sri.Noushad K.A., the learned Public Prosecutor as\nwell.\n\n5. The nature of allegations as evidenced from the final report is\nthat the accused had assaulted the defacto complainant after hitting his\nbike with a motor car. Of course on 13.03.2020 it is noticed that the\ndefacto complainant himself changed his stance and stated that he had\nnot hit the bike with the car, but when the defacto complainant fell down\nhe was assaulted. Anyway, considering the nature of allegations, it is\nevident that appreciation of evidence is essential to arrive at a conclusion.\nExercise of the inherent powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. ought to be\nresorted to only in cases where the admitted allegations do not make out\nany of the offences alleged.\n\n6. In the instant case, the allegations in final report indicate the\ncommission of offence. Whether those allegations are true or not are all\nmatters of trial.\n\nTherefore, I find that this is a case which requires appreciation of\nevidence and the remedy under Section 482 Cr.P.C.cannot be invoked.\n\nHence, this Crl.M.C. is dismissed.\n\nSd/-\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, JUDGE\nRKM\n\npes)\ntha Gets a\naa\noie het See\nBe\n2024/KER/2380\nCRL.MC NO. 196 OF 2024\n4\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 196/2024\nPETITIONERS’ ANNEXURES :\nAnnexure I A TRUE COPY OF THE FIR IN CRIME.
