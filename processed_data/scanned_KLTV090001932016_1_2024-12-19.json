The sole Accused herein is the husband of the Informant.\n2. The Prosecution allegation is that on 07.03.2012, the Accused in violation of the\nProtection Order passed in favour of the Informant herein, slapped the Informant on\nher face, showered obscene words on her, outraged her modesty thereby and\ncommitted the offences punishable under Sections 294(b), 188, 323 and 354 of the Indian\nPenal Code (hereinafter referred to as the ‘IPC’).\n3. On the basis of the final report, cognizance was taken in respect of the offences\nunder Sections 294(b), 323 and 354 of the IPC. Ingredients of the Offence under Section\n188 of the IPC were found to be not made out. On issuance of process, the Accused\nentered appearance. After preliminary hearing, charge was framed for the offences\nunder Sections 294(b), 323 and 354 of the IPC. It was read over and explained to the\nAccused to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.\n\n3\n\n4, From the side of Prosecution, CWs 1, 2, additional witness (as per Order in\n\nC.M.P. No. 3126/2024) and CW5 were examined as PWs 1 to 5 respectively and Exhibits\n\nP1, Pi(a), P2 to P7 were marked. Pursuant to closure of evidence of the Prosecution, the\n\nAccused was examined under Section 313(1)(b) of the CrPC wherein he denied all the\n\nincriminating circumstances adduced against him by the Prosecution. No Defence\n\nevidence was adduced by the Accused.\n\n5. Heard both sides. The following points arise for consideration:\n\n(i) Has the Accused by uttering obscene words against her and thereby committed\nthe offences punishable under Sections 294(b) of the IPC?\n\n(ii) | Has the Accused voluntarily caused hurt to PW1 by slapping on her face and\nthereby committed the offence punishable under Section 323 of the IPC?\n\n(iii) Has the Accused intentionally outraged the modesty of the Informant by using\ncriminal force on her and thereby committed the offences punishable under\nSection 354 of the IPC?\n\n(iv) If so, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded?\n\n6. Point(a): The injured was examined as PW1 and her FIS marked as Exhibit\n\nP1. To prove the incident, CW2, the occurrence witness was examined as PW2. The\n\nInvestigating Officer, PW3, recorded Exhibit P1 statement and Exhibit P1(a) body note\n\nand on the basis of the same, registered Exhibit P2 FIR. He further prepared Exhibit P4\n\nscene Mahazar, Exhibit P5 Arrest Memo recording the arrest of the Accused, Exhibit P6\n\nBail Bond, and Exhibit P8 Address Report. The Wound Certificate was initially marked\n\nsubject to proof through PW3. Since it was reported from the side of Prosecution that\n\nthe presence of CW5, the doctor who had examined PW1 could not be procured as he\nwas unavailable, the Superintendent, General Hospital Trivandrum was examined as\n\n4\nPW4 for the purpose of proving the Exhibit P7 Wound Certificate as per Order in\nC.M.P. No. 3126/2024. Subsequently, PW5 mounted the box and proved Exhibit P7.\n\nPW1, deposed that on 07.03.2012 at 10:00 AM in front of her house at Kaladi,\nwhen she resisted the Accused from take away their child, he slapped on her left cheek\nthereby causing her to fall down and further abused her with the words ‘ajeneajl enon,\naggaamg gatos!’ and kicked her twice or thrice. PW2, the occurrence witness also deposed.\nin support of the said version that he witnessed the same and heard the Accused\nabusing PW1.\n\nThe Learned Counsel for the Accused would argue that the Prosecution has not\nbeen able to prove that the alleged abusive words were of such a nature that is\nlascivious, appealing to the prurient interest or capable of arousing sexually impure\nthoughts in the minds of its hearers and therefore the offence under Section 294(b) of\nthe IPC is not attracted. The Learned APP on the other hand, would contend that the\nalleged abusive words have been categorically deposed to by PW1 in her FIS as well as\nbefore this Court and the said incident has occurred in front of her house on a Pongala\nday and CW2 has also deposed to have heard the Accused abusing the PW1. She\nfurther submits that no questions or suggestions put forth from the side of the Defence\nas to whether the said words are lascivious or otherwise.\n\nIn order to attract the offence under Section 294(b) of the IPC, it is essential the\nfollowing ingredients have to be satisfied- (i) the offender has uttered any obscene word.\nin or near any public place and (ii) the same has caused annoyance to the others. In\naddition, the words so uttered must be of such a nature that it must be lascivious,\nappealing to the prurient interest or capable of arousing sexually impure thoughts in\nthe minds of its hearers. To establish an offence under Section 294(b) of the IPC, all these\nconditions have to be satisfied conjunctively and not alternatively. See, James Jose v.\n\n5\nState of Kerala, 2019 (3) KHC 531; Sangeetha Lakshmana v. State of Kerala, 2008 (2)\nKLT 745; Latheef v. State of Kerala 2014 (2) KHC 604\n\nHere, admittedly the place of alleged occurrence is house compound of PW1. It is\ntrue that the alleged abusive words have been categorically deposed to by PW1.\nHowever, it is to be noted that even if the place of occurrence is taken to be near a\npublic place, considering the fact that the alleged date of occurrence was pongala day; it\nhas not come out from the evidence either of PW1 or of PW2 that the alleged abusive\nwords caused annoyance to them or to anyone else who had heard the same and that it\nwas of such a nature that it was lascivious, appealing to the prurient interest or capable\nof arousing sexually impure thoughts in their minds. Furthermore, PW2 deposed that\nhe heard and saw the Accused allegedly abusing PW1, but the words thereto are not\ndeposed by him, nor has he deposed that the same had caused annoyance to him. This\nCourt is unable to accept the contention of the Learned APP that no such questions as to\nthe nature of the alleged abusive words were put forth by the Defence. The reason being\nthat, the onus on the Defence arises only when the Prosecution has discharged its initial\nburden to establish the ingredients of the alleged offence, which is conspicuously absent\nin the present case. Hence this Court finds that the ingredients of the said offence are\nnot attracted in the present case and this point is found in favour of the Accused.\n\n7. Point (b) and (c): These points are considered together for the sake of brevity and\nto avoid repetition.\n\nPW1, the injured, deposed that she gave Exhibit P1 Statement to the police to the\neffect that she has been injured by the Accused, who is her husband on 07.03.2012 at\n10:00 AM in front of her house at Kaladi. She deposed that the Accused attempted to\ntake away their child and she resisted him, whereby he slapped on her left cheek\nthereby causing her to fall down. He further uttered obscene word against her and\n\n6\n\nkicked her twice or thrice. Hearing her scream when she got kicked by him, people\ngathered and the Accused left the kid there and ran away. The said act of the Accused\ncaused her mental agony and she got defamed. She deposed that she got injured in the\nincident and that she sustained contusions on her face and thigh. According to her, the\ntrial was proceeding in the case filed by her against him under Protection of Women\nfrom Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘DV Act’) and she\nsecured a Protection Order in her favour prior to this incident, which is the reason for\nthe alleged act of the Accused. She deposed that she took treatment from General\nHospital Thiruvananthapuram and that the delay of two days in intimating the police\noccurred because of the reason that it was Aattukal Pongala on the said day and the\nroads were blocked and further that her two-year daughter had an offering on that day.\n\nPW2 deposed to have witnessed the incident on 07.03.2012. According to him, he\nwent along with CW3, his friend, to the home of PW1 as his sister was also having\nPongala offering on that day and they came to witness the same. While he was near the\ncar porch, he heard the cry of the kid and also that of PW1. He went there and saw the\nAccused having slapped on the cheek of PW1 and her having fallen down, kicked by\nhim twice on her left leg and further the Accused having uttered abusive word to her\nand told her to get off. By the time he rushed there, the Accused had run away. The\nother ladies took her inside and he came to know that she got injured. But he did not\ncare much attention as it was on the legs. He gave statement to the police on 09.03.2012.\n\nPW3 deposed that he had recorded Exhibit P1(a) body note of PW1 and her left\ncheek was found to ben swollen on 09.03.2012. PW5, the Doctor deposed that he had\nexamined PW1 on 09.03.2012 with an alleged history of assault by her husband at the\nhome and that she had complained of body ache alone and there were no external\ninjuries noted on the examination and further that in his opinion, the injury could be as\nalleged.\n\n7\n\nThe Learned Counsel for the Accused would argue that the ingredients of\nSection 323 of the IPC are not established in the present case. It is contented that\naccording to PW1, she got injured and sustained contusion on her face and thigh.\nHowever, as per the deposition of PW5, PW1 had complained of body ache only and\nthere are no internal or external injuries noted on the person of PW1. Thus, the alleged\ninjuries stated to have been sustained by PW1 have not been corroborated by the\nmedical evidence and that it is PW5 who had deposed that PW1 complained of body\nache, and PW1 has no such case that she had any body ache. Further, as regards the\nswelling on her cheek recorded in Exhibit P1(a), the Learned Counsel for the Accused\ndrew the attention of this Court that no such swelling could be noted by the medical\nexpert, when PW5 examined her and that the body note was in fact recorded on the\nsame day afternoon prior to examination by the doctor in the evening, which is only a\nmatter of difference of a few hours in between. The Learned Counsel for the Accused\nalso submits that there is a delay in registration of the crime and examination by the\nDoctor, which were held on 09.03.2012 and the delay is not sufficiently explained.\n\nIt is the specific case of the Accused that this case is only an offshoot of the\nongoing matrimonial disputes between the parties. The investigation according to the\nAccused was conducted without even a preliminary enquiry as regards whether the\nalleged Protection Order was communicated to the Accused or not, especially when it is\nadmitted by PW1 that there are ongoing matrimonial disputes between PW1 and the\nAccused. The Learned Counsel points out that PW2 is an interested witness, for the\nreason that he is a close relative of PW1 and his evidence is not believable as he denied.\nknowledge as to the ongoing disputes between the Accused and PW1, when he had so\nadmitted the same to the Investigating Officer in his statement and when PW1 herself\nadmits the said fact of his knowledge thereto. It is further submitted that there is\ndiscrepancy in the Exhibit P3 Scene Mahazar as the same is seen to have been prepared\n\n8\non the date of occurrence itself when the consistent case of Prosecution is that Crime\nwas registered on 09.03.2012 and there is not report from the side of the Investigating\nOfficer pointing out that the same was a bonafide mistake.\n\nPer contra, the Learned APP points out that PW1 has categorically deposed that\non the said date and at the said time, in front of her house, the Accused slapped on her\nleft cheek, when she resisted the attempt of the Accused in taking away their chid,\nthereby causing her to fall down and that he further uttered obscene words to her and\nkicked her twice or thrice. She deposed that she sustained injuries and that she was\ntreated at the General Hospital. The said act of the Accused causing injury to PW1 is\ndeposed to have been witnessed by PW2. It is further substantiated from the evidence\nof PW3, the I.O. on basis of Exhibit P1(a) body note that there was swelling found on\nthe left cheek of PW1 and also Exhibit P7 Wound Certificate proved through PW5\nDoctor. The Learned APP would argue that in order to attract Section 323 of the IPC,\neven pain is sufficient and that PW1 has deposed that she sustained injuries, supported\nby Exhibit Pl(a) body note recording the existence of swelling on her left cheek and\nExhibit P7, read with deposition of PW5 that PW1 had complained of body ache. The\nLearned APP contends that the delay herein has more specifically been explained by\nPW1 herself that there was an offering in the name of her child on the same day, roads\nwere blocked due to Pongala and there were no police aid posts for the said reason. She\nfurther argues that communication of Protection Order is immaterial in this case for the\nreason that, even if for argument’s sake, it is taken that there was non-communication\nof the same to the Accused, the alleged act of the Accused, i.e.; slapping, showering\nobscene words and kicking PW1, for whatever reason, would make the factum of non-\ncommunication inconsequential. It is further submitted that PW2 cannot strictly be said\nto be an interested witness merely for the reason that he is a relative of the Informant.\nHis presence thereon was natural as he had come to the alleged place of occurrence to\n\n9\nwitness the said Pongala, as his sister was also having Pongala offering in the house of\nthe Informant and is a possible eye-witness.\n\nI have carefully gone through the materials on record, and considered the\nsubmissions of the Learned APP and the Learned Counsel for the Accused. This Court\nis unable to accept the contention of the Learned Counsel for the Accused that there was\nnot even a preliminary enquiry as regards whether the alleged Protection Order was\ncommunicated to the Accused or not, especially when it is admitted by PW1 that there\nare ongoing matrimonial disputes between PW1 and the Accused. It is true that PW1\nhas admitted that there are on-going matrimonial disputes between the parties and\neven relating to the custody of the child. The alleged act of the Accused, as rightly\npointed out by the Learned APP, if proved and substantiated, would make the fact of\nnon-communication of the Protection Order, if any, inconsequential for the reason that\nuse of force cannot be justified except under the existence of exceptional circumstances\nsuch as exercise of right of private defence etc., and that too unless it falls within the\nspecific parameters laid down by law in force.\n\nPertaining to the question of PW2, being an interested witness, this Court dispel\nthe contention of the Learned Counsel for the Accused that he is an interested witness.\nIt is well settled that a close relative who is a very natural witness, cannot be regarded\nas an interested witness under all circumstances. He must be a witness who derives\nsome benefit from the result of a litigation (See Shinoj and Others v. State of Kerala,\n2019 KHC 862). Merely for the reason that PW1 admitted him to be her close relative,\nand his denial as to the knowledge of the on-going matrimonial disputes between the\nparties, would not make him an interested witness. The contradiction in his deposition\nas regards his knowledge as to matrimonial disputes (Exhibit D3) stand proved through\nexamination of PW3. That would in view of this Court would definitely throw doubt as\nto his veracity but cannot be said to be an interested witness as his presence thereon\n\n10\nwas natural. The possibility of him being the only available witness however cannot be\ninferred in the present case for the reason that even according to PW1, people had\ngathered hearing her scream, and according to PW2, PW1 was taken by other ladies\npursuant to being injured.\n\nAs regards the delay, this Court is of the view that the same has not been\nproperly explained. It is true that PW1 deposed that since it was Pongala there weren't\nany police aid post and she had an offering in the name of her child. However, the same\nreason for not getting herself treated for two days, despite said alleged contusions on\nher face and thigh definitely throws doubt on the case of Prosecution.\n\nOn appreciation of evidence of Prosecution Witnesses as regards ingredients of\noffence punishable under Section 323 of the IPC, it is seen that PW1 has categorically\ndeposed as to the alleged overt act by the Accused, i.e., slapping and kicking her, as\nrightly pointed out by the Learned APP and the same is specifically substantiated by the\nevidence of PW2. During cross-examination, PW2 deposed that the incident occurred so\nspontaneous that he couldn’t interfere in between and resist the Accused. It is true that\nswelling is seen noted in Exhibit Pl(a) and PW5 also admitted that the patient had\nalleged of body ache. It is however pertinent to note that according to PW1, she got\ninjured and the injuries sustained by her are contusions on her face and thigh. No\nexternal injuries to the effect as alleged by PW1 is seen to have been noted by PW5 who\nhad examined her on 09.03.2012 evening. Despite deposition by PW5 that PW1 had\ncomplained of body ache, she herself has no case that the alleged act had caused any\npain, bodily disease or infirmity to her. She has no case that by the time she went to the\nhospital her alleged contusions had been healed. Admittedly, she gave Exhibit P1\nStatement and got herself treated one day later from the alleged date of occurrence and\nboth these happened simultaneously, one after the other. Exhibit Pl(a) by PW3 is of\ncourse prior in point of time denoting swelling on the left cheek of PW1, which is\n\n11\n\nspecifically not seen reflected in the examination by PW5, the Doctor on the same day\nafter a few hours. PW1 never had a case that the alleged act of Accused caused swelling\non her left cheek and the same suddenly got healed by the time she reached the hospital\nby evening. PW3, to the specific suggestion put forth in the cross-examination in the\nsaid regard, admitted that there are no injuries, not even swelling noted by PW5 during\nthe examination of PW1. It is at this juncture that the Learned Counsel for the Accused\npointed out that even if the evidence of PWs 1 and 2 is taken on its face value, the\noffence punishable under Section 323 IPC is not attracted as the fact that hurt was\ncaused by the Accused by the alleged act itself is not proved by the Prosecution. This\nCourt finds considerable force in the contention of the Learned Counsel for the Accused\nthe offence punishable under Section 323 IPC is not attracted as PW1 has not deposed\nthat in consequence of the alleged act thereof she sustained any bodily pain, disease or\ninfirmity.\n\nIt is settled that in order to bring an act within the definition of ‘hurt’ the same\nshould cause bodily pain, disease or infirmity to any person. To prove an offence under\nSection 323 IPC, the Prosecution has to necessarily prove that the alleged act has also\ncaused bodily pain, disease or infirmity to any person. See Padmakumar v. State of\nKerala, 2024 KER 8129. PW1 has not deposed to the effect that she sustained any bodily\npain, disease or infirmity. The injuries deposed to have been sustained by her is not\ncorroborated by PW5, the Doctor. Hence, in absence of statement of PW1 that she\nsustained any bodily pain, disease or infirmity on account of the alleged act of Accused,\nthis Court finds that Prosecution has failed to substantiate and prove its case that\ningredients of offence punishable under Section 323 IPC is attracted. This point is\ntherefore answered in favour of the Accused.\n\nTo attract the offence punishable under Sections 354 of the IPC, it is incumbent\nthat following ingredients have to be established: (i) the offence must be against a\n\n12\n\nwoman (ii) there must be use of criminal force or assault against a woman, and (iii) use\nof such force or assault must be with an intention or knowledge that it would outrage\nher modesty. Mere vague statements are not sufficient to establish the said intention.\nThe Learned Counsel for the Accused points out that from the deposition of PW3, it is\nadmitted that the said offence was charge although it was ascertained that Accused was\nthe husband of PW1 and it is also argued that the intention thereof, which is sine qua\nnon for attracting the alleged offence is not seen proved or established. Here, there is\nnothing on the materials on record, either in the Final Report, deposition of the\nwitnesses or otherwise to attribute such an intention as contemplated under Section 354\nof the IPC. Hence, this point is also answered in favour of the Accused.\n8. Point (d): In view of the above, resultantly, this Court finds that the\nProsecution has failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The Accused is found.\nnot guilty of having committed the offences punishable under Sections 294(b), 323 and\n354 of the IPC and is acquitted thereof under Section 248(1) of the CrPC. His bail bond\nstands cancelled and he is set at liberty.\n\n(Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected\nby me and pronounced in open Court on this, the 19\" day of December, 2024.)\n\nJudicial Magistrate of First Class -I,\nThiruvananthapuram.\n\n13\nAPPENDIX\n\nA:Prosecution witness\n\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical witness,\nOther witness\n\nPW4 Dr. Jayakumar, Medical Witness\n\nSuperintendent(General\nHospital)\n\nPWS —__—P sKrishnachandran Medical Witness\n\nB:Defence witness\n\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical witness,\nOther witness\n\nC:Court witness\n\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\n\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical witness,\n\n14\na ee\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA.
