No.704/2020 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-ll,\nMavelikara, the learned Magistrate has not passed appropriate orders\nthereon.\n\n2.

No.704/2020, as early as on\n03.11.2021. If orders on the said application have not been issued so far,\npetitioner is certainly justified in approaching this Court seeking the reliefs\nas sought for in this criminal miscellaneous case.\n\n3. In view of the above, there will be a direction to the Judicial First\nClass Magistrate Court-ll, Mavelikara, to consider the application filed in\nC.C.
