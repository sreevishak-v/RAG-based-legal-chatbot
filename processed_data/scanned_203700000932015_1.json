The offences\ninvolved in the case are under Sections 143, 147, 148 and 324\nIPC read with Section 149 IPC. The original accused Nos 1 to 4\nfaced trial before the learned Additional Sessions Court (Adhoc)-\nII, Thrissur in S.C.No.281/2005, and obtained a judgment of\nacquittal on 05.09.2009 when none of the material witnesses\nexamined by the prosecution including the first informant\nsupported the prosecution. The case against the accused Nos 5\nand 6 was split up and refiled when they remained consistently\nabsent. Thereafter, the original 6\" accused faced trial in S.C.No.\n1053/2009 before the same court, and he also obtained a\njudgment of acquittal on 04.05.2010, when all the material\nwitnesses turned hostile. The case against the petitioner herein\nwas again split up, and now it stands transferred to the register\nof long pending cases as L.P.No.64/2008.

All the\nmaterial witnesses including the injured first informant turned\nhostile during trial. The defacto complainant, Sabeesh, who\nsustained injuries in the incident is the 2\"? respondent herein, and\nthe other person who sustained injuries is the 3% respondent.\nThey have filed affidavit to the effect that they have settled the\nwhole dispute with the accused including the petitioner herein,\nand that they have no grievance or complaint. In fact, on a\nperusal of the records, I find that there is absolutely nothing to\nattract Section 308 IPC in this case. It appears that the said\nsection was incorporated by the police on the basis of a purely\nhypothetical statement. Any way, the whole dispute stands\nsettled, and the parties have come to terms. It is definite that in\nsuch a_ situation, continuance of prosecution against the\npetitioner will not serve any purpose, other than wasting the\n\nEgan\nate\nap eas\n2015/KER/787\nCrlM.C..
