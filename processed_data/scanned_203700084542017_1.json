The allegation of the prosecution was that on\n28.10.2017 at 21.15 hours, the accused trespassed into\nthe house of the defacto complainant restrained her, her\nmother and grand mother. Thereafter, they were beaten\nup. There is a further allegation that the third accused\ntore her nightly and molested her. When the anticipatory\nbail application came up before the learned Sessions\nJudge, the learned Sessions Judge noticed that the\naccused 1 to 4 attacked the defacto complainant and\nothers since she had _ claimed Rs.4,75,000/- as\nmaintenance granted by the Family Court. It appears\nthat the petitioners are the husband and in-laws of the\ndefacto complainant. Having considered the entire facts,\n\n2017/KER/49780\nCrl.M.C.No.8454 of 2017\n2\n\nthe learned Judge by order dated 18.11.2017, which is\nproduced as Annexure-A, granted bail, inter alia, on a\ncondition that he shall remit 50% of the arrears of the\nmaintenance if any before the Family Court and produce\n\nthe receipt before the investigating officer before\nexecuting the bond. That portion of the order is under\nchallenge in the present proceedings.\n\n3. After hearing the learned counsel for the\npetitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor though the\nintention of the court below in imposing such a condition\nthat may appear to be prima facie appreciable, legally it\ndoes not appear to be sustainable. Granting of bail,\nshould not be dependant on a condition of deposit of the\nportion of the money in a different proceedings between\nparties. It was submitted by the learned counsel for the\nfirst petitioner that the total amount due is only\nRs.2,43,000/- out of he has deposited a sum of\nRs.1,02,000/-. A statement which has been filed by the\nlearned counsel for the petitioner to that effect. Without\n\nEevee\nBi Geis i\nees\n2017/KER/49780\nCrl.M.C.No.8454 of 2017\n3\ngoing into the dispute as to how much amount is due and\nthe amount deposited, I am inclined to interfere with the\ncondition No.2 issued by the court below. Hence, Crl.M.C\nwill stand allowed and the petitioner herein shall comply\nwith the Annexure-Al order except condition No.2, which\nshall not be insisted upon. The petitioner shall comply\nwith all other conditions than condition No.2.\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE\nR.AV\n//True Copy//\nPA to Judge\n\n"
