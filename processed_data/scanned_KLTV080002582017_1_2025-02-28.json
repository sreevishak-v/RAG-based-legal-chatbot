This is a case charge sheeted by the Sub Inspector of Police, Poojappura Police\nStation in crime No. 148/2016 alleging commission of offences u/s 447, 294(b),\n506(ii) and 323 of IPC. Cognizance is taken for the offences punishable u/s 447, 323\n\n2\nand 506(i) of IPC.\n\n2. The prosecution case in brief is that the accused who was working as the\nManager at Future General Insurance, due to enmity towards CW1 for\nrefusing to take insurance police, on 15/02/2016 at 11.30 am, criminally\ntrespassed into the courtyard of CW1’s house, that is, T.C. 42/4853,\nVaikundam House, shouted abusive words at CW1, caught hold on his dress\nand pushed him down. The accused also criminally intimidated CW1 by\nthreatening to defame him. Thereby the accused committed the offences as\nalleged against him.\n\n3. Accused appeared on summons and he was furnished with copies of all\nrelevant prosecution records. After hearing, particulars of the offences u/s\n447, 323 and 506(i) of IPC was framed and it was read over and explained to\nhim and he pleaded not guilty.\n\n4. To prove their case, the prosecution examined CW2, CW3, CW5, CW7 and\nCW8 as PW1 to PW5 respectively and marked documents as Ext.P1 to P5. It\nis reported that CW1 is not willing to appear before the court or to adduce\nevidence. CW4 is reportedly abroad. CW6 is given up by the prosecution.\nHence, the prosecution evidence was closed. As there were no incriminating\ncircumstances brought out in evidence against accused, examination u/s 313\nof Cr.P.C was not necessary. The accused did not adduce any evidence.\n\n5. Heard both the sides.\n\n6. The points that arise for consideration are:-\n\n1. Whether the accused had committed the offences punishable u/s 447,\n323 and 506(i) of IPC, as alleged?\n\n3\n2. What shall be the sentence or order?\n\n7. Point No.1 :- The evidence in this case consists of depositions of Switnesses\nand 5 documents from the side of the prosecution. PW1 is the former wife of\nCW1. She deposed that she did not see the alleged incident and turned hostile\nto prosecution. PW2 cited as occurrence witness denied having witnessed the\nincident. PW3 who was the former driver of CW1 deposed that on 15/02/2017\nat about 10.30 am a woman who was LIC agent came to the house of CW1\nand thereafter a few men came there and created problems. As per PW3, the\nissue arose for not taking insurance policy. PW3 deposed further that he did\nnot see any incident of assault and turned hostile to prosecution. PW4 was the\nSub Inspector of Police at Poojappura Police Station. He recorded Ext.P1 FI\nStatement and registered Ext.P2 FIR u/s 143, 147, 149, 447, 294(b), 506(ii)\nand 323 of IPC. Ext.P3 is the Scene Mahazar prepared by PW4. PW5 took\nover investigation of the case and filed Ext.P4 report deleting sections 143,\n147 and 149 of IPC. Ext.P5 is the name and address report of the accused.\nPW5 completed investigation and filed final report against the accused.\n\n8. From the above evidence, it is clear that the injured in the case is not\nexamined by prosecution. All the occurrence witnesses denied having\nwitnessed any incident as alleged. The remaining evidence is that of formal\nand official witnesses. There is nothing to prove the occurrence as alleged or\nto connect the accused with the offences. Thus, the prosecution failed to prove\nthat the accused committed the offences u/s 447, 323 and 506(i) of IPC. Point\nNo.1 is found against the prosecution.\n\n9. Point No.2 :- In view of my finding on point no.1, the accused is found not\n\n4\nguilty of the offences u/s 447, 323 and 506(i) of IPC, he is acquitted u/s\n255(1) of Cr.PC and set at liberty, cancelling his bail bond.\n\nDictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected\n\nand pronounced by me in open Court on this the 28\" day of February 2025.\n\n¢\nElsa Catherine George\nAdditional Chief Judicial Magistrate\nCHIE, .
