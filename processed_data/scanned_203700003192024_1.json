CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n12.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\ne\n2024/KER/2384\nCRL.MC NO. 319 OF 2024\n2\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.\n~ GrLLM.C.No.319 of 2024\nDated this the 12\" day of January, 2024\nORDER\n\nBy order dated 23.02.2023 in Crl.M.P.No.3910 of 2022 in\nCrlA.No.17 of 2022, the learned Sessions Judge permitted the petitioner\nto apply for a passport with a short validity of one year. Petitioner\nsubmits that unless the passport has a validity of five years, the\nresidence permit already granted to her, will not be extended by the\nGerman Government.\n\n2. I have heard Sri.Babu S.Nair, the learned counsel for the\npetitioner, Smt.Sreeja V., the learned Public Prosecutor as well as\nSri.Manu S., the learned Deputy Solicitor General of India.\n\n3. A perusal of the impugned order reveals that the prosecution\nhad no objection in the petitioner being issued with a passport. Since\nthere is no objection from the prosecution and the criminal case is at the\nappellate stage, petitioner's presence before the court during the\npendency of the appeal is not necessary. Further, the court has already\ndirected the issuance of the passport to the petitioner. In such\ncircumstances, granting validity for the passport for a period of five years\nwould not cause any prejudice to the prosecution.\n\nTherefore, in modification of Annexure E order, petitioner is\npermitted to apply for a passport with a validity of five years. If in case\n\nBele sse a]\nDee aa!\n2024/KER/2384\nCRL.MC NO. 319 OF 2024\n3\nsuch application is filed, the 3 respondent shall reissue the passport to\nthe petitioner with a validity of five years, provided she is otherwise\neligible. Petitioner shall however file an affidavit providing the details of\nher residential address in Germany to the 3 respondent.\nThe Cri.M.C.is disposed of as above.\nSd/-\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, JUDGE\n\nRKM\n\nRe Cl)\naes\nORF\n2024/KER/2384\nCRL.MC NO. 319 OF 2024\n4\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 319/2024\nPETITIONER'S ANNEXURES :\nAnnexure A A TRUE COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT IN CRIME\nNO.1274/2012 OF THE FORT KOCHI POLICE\nSTATION\nAnnexure B TRUE COPY OF THE NEW ITEM PUBLISHED IN\nINDIAN EXPRESS DAILY DATED 6-11-2012\nAnnexure C A TRUE COPY OF THE JUDGMENT IN\nC.C.NO.1954/2017 OF THE J.F.C.M.,\nMATTANCHERY DATED, 20-12-2021\nAnnexure D TRUE COPY OF THE FIRST AND LAST PAGE OF\nTHE PASSPORT OF THE PETITIONER\nAnnexure E TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER DATED, 23-2-2023\nIN CRL.M.P.NO.3910/2022 IN\nCRL.A.NO.17/2022 OF THE ADDITIONAL\nSESSIONS JUDGE-V, ERNAKULAM\n\n"
