CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON\n15.12.2020, THE COURT ON 05.01.2021 PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nLe\n\nhare\n\nBera\n\nCr1.MC.5684/2020 2 202 UKER/361\nV.G.ARUN, J.\nDated this the 5\" day of January, 2021\nORDER\n\nPetitioner is the 2\" accused in S.T.No. 25 of 2017 and connected\n\ncases pending before the Judicial Magistrate of the First Class-ll, Tirur. The\n\ncases originated from complaints filed by the 1* respondent against the\n\npetitioner and another, alleging commission of the offence under Section\n\n138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. In the complaint it is alleged that the\n\npetitioner, in his capacity as a Director of the 1** accused Company, had\n\nentered into an agreement with the complainant Company for supply of\n\ncement to the concrete mixing unit of the 1% accused Company. The\n\ncement was supplied as per the agreement, but the accused failed to pay\n\nthe price of the cement and the commission agreed upon. The dispute was\n\nlater resolved and an agreement entered into between the complainant, in\n\nterms of which the petitioner acknowledged the liability and issued four\n\ncheques towards its discharge. The cheques were dishonoured on\npresentation due to insufficiency of funds in the accusedâ€™s account.\nThereupon statutory notices, demanding payment of the amount was\n\nissued, which also failed to evoke any response and hence complaints\n\nwere filed. Since the cheques pertained to a common liability between the\n\nLe\nbalk es\nCr1.MC.5684/2020 3 202UKER/S61\nsame parties, the court ordered joint trial. During the course of such trial,\nthe petitioner filed an application seeking to send the cheques for experi\nopinion regarding the entries therein. The said application stands rejected\nby Annexure A1 order and hence this Crl.M.C.\n\n2. The application seeking expert opinion was filed on the premise\nthat, during his cross examination, the complainant had testified that,\nexcept the amount in figures and the date, all other entries in the cheque\nwere in his handwriting and that,the amount in figures and the date was\nwritten by the petitioner. It is for disproving this fact and thereby\nestablishing the falsity of the case set up by the complainant that the\nrequest was made to send the cheques for expert opinion.\n\n3. The first respondent filed objection contending that the attempt is\nonly to protract the proceedings and that, no dispute having been raised\nregarding the other entries in the cheque, including the amount entered in\nwords and the signature, no purpose would be served by obtaining expert\nopinion regarding the date and the amount in figures.\n\n4. The learned Magistrate accepted the objection raised by the first\nrespondent and dismissed the application finding that, obtaining\nhandwriting experts opinion would in no way help the court to arrive at a\njust decision in the case.\n\n5. Sri. N.K.Mohanlal, learned Counsel for the petitioner, assailed the\n\nLe\nbalk es\nCr1.MC.5684/2020 4 202 UKER/361\nfindings in the impugned order, contending that, by dismissing the\napplication the lower court had prevented the petitioner from letting in best\nevidence. It is contended that the expert opinion would have aided the\npetitioner in setting up rebuttal evidence.\n\n6. A perusal of the impugned order reveals that the petitioner had\nexecuted Exhibit P14 agreement acknowledging the liability and had\nentered the particulars of the cheques issued towards discharge of the\nliability in that document. The petitioner has not disputed his signature in\nthe agreement. Further, the petitioner has not disputed his signature in the\ncheques or the amount entered in words. Therefore, as rightly found by the\nlearned Magistrate, no purpose would be served by sending the cheques\nfor expert opinion, other than delaying the trial unnecessarily.\n\nIn the result, the Cri. M. C. Is dismissed.\n\nSd/-\nV.G.ARUN, JUDGE\nvgs\n\nIRA 2\nLe\nHea Be\nre i\nBP) * bE\nCrl.MC.5684/2020 5 2021/KER/361\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE Al CERTIFIED COPY OF THE ORDER DATED\n11.12.2020 IN C.M.P. 302/2020.\n\n"
