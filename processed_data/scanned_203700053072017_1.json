A. TO JUDGE\nPn\n\n2017/KER/49288\nSUNIL THOMAS, J.\nDated this the 6 day of December, 2017\nORDER\n\nThe petitioners herein challenged Annexures Al & A4 FIRs\nand Annexure A5 final report laid in the above FIRs. The crux of\nthe allegation of the 3™ respondent herein was that, on\n02.04.2014 at about 2.30 p.m., the accused assaulted the 3”\nrespondent herein and her family members and caused bodily\ninjuries. It was alleged that with the intention of humiliating and\ndowngrading her and outraging her modesty, being a member of\na scheduled caste, the petitioners uttered abusive words and\ncommitted overt acts.

It was also\nalleged that the main offence under SC/ST (POA) Act were not\nincorporated in the FIR. Invoking Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C.\n\n2017/KER/49288\n\nCri. M. C. No. 5307 of 2017 2\n\nAnnexure 3 was referred to the Police, who after registering\nAnnexure 4 FIR No.504/2014 for offences punishable under\nSections 141, 149, 294(a),(b), 323, 324, 354, 441 of IPC and\nSections 3(1)(x)(xi) and (xv), 3(2)(VIl) 4 of SC/ST POA Act,\ninvestigated into the allegations. Later, finding that the place of\nincident and the subject matter involved in both the FIS were the\nsame, they were clubbed together and report was given to the\ncourt. After completion of investigation final report was laid as\nAnnexure 5.\n\n2. The petitioners, contending that two FIRs in relation to\nthe same incident is impermissible, that the learned Magistrate,\neven after being informed about the registration of crime went on\ninvoking Section 156(3) of Cr.P.C. and ought to have invoked the\nprovision under Section 210 Cr.P.C. and further that on merits the\noffence under SC/ST (POA) Act was not made out, sought to quash\nboth the FIS and the final report. Learned counsel for the\npetitioners, relied on the decision reported in Babubhai V. State\nof Gujarat and Others [(2010) 12 SCC 254] contended that\nmore than one FIR is not permissible and if both the FIRs satisfy\nthe test of sameness, the second FIR is liable to be quashed. On\n\n2017/KER/49288\n\nCri. M. C. No. 5307 of 2017 3\n\nthe other hand, learned counsel for the 3\" respondent contended\nthat though Annexure Al FIR was laid, the investigating agency\ndid not incorporate the relevant offences that were made out in\nthe FIS and did not conduct proper investigation. Hence, the 3%\nrespondent was justified in invoking the jurisdiction of the learned\nMagistrate and the Magistrate was perfectly justified in invoking\nSection 156(3) Cr.P.C. To buttress the argument, the learned\ncounsel relied on the decision reported in Antony V. State of\nKerala [2001 (3) KLT 1 (SC)].\n\n3. Annexure 5 final report itself shows that after the\nregistration of the second FIR, on finding that the allegations\nrelated to the same incident, both were clubbed together and a\nsingle investigation was conducted. It ended in Annexure 5 final\nreport. In Babubhai's case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court had\nspecifically held that there cannot be more than one FIR in\nrelation to the same cognizable offence. However, the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court held that, in the case of a subsequent FIR, the\nCourt has to examine the facts and circumstances giving rise to\nboth the FIRs and the test of sameness is to be applied to find out\nwhether both the FIRs related to the same incident in respect of\n\n2017/KER/49288\nCri. M. C. No. 5307 of 2017 4\nSame occurrence or are in regard to the incidents which were two\nor more parts of the same transaction.\n\n4. A perusal of Annexure 1 show that it related to\noffences punishable under Sections 323, 354 and 34 IPC. The\nallegations in the second FIS as well as in the private complaint\nwere on a different footing, though it related to the same incident.\nTo that extent, it cannot be said that there was sameness of FIRs\nin both cases. In the above circumstance, the law laid down by\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court in Antony's case appear to be more\napplicable to the facts of this case. Evidently, in the case at hand,\nthere was no fresh investigation pursuant to the second FIR. In\nfact there was only single investigation after the registration of\nboth the crimes.\n\n5. It was vehemently contended by the learned counsel\nfor the petitioners that the offence under the SC/ST (POA) Act was\nnot made out and that the predominant motive involved was the\nproperty dispute. It was contended that the allegations raised\nagainst the accused can only constitute, if at all, an offence under\nSection 354 IPC and not under Section 3 of the SC/ST (POA) Act.\nOn the other hand, the learned counsel for the 3 respondent\n\n2017/KER/49288\n\nCri. M. C. No. 5307 of 2017 5\n\nrelied on the decision reported in Manju Devi V. Onkarjit Singh\nAhluwalia alias Omkarjeet Singh and Others (2017 Crl.L.].\n2879), wherein, the Hon'ble Supreme Court had made the clear\ndistinction between an offence under Section 354 IPC and one\nunder Section 3 of SC/ST (POA) Act at paragraphs 14 & 15.\nAccording to the Hon'ble Supreme Court when caste name is\nused, that stands on a different footing from a mere offence under\nSection 354 IPC. According to the Hon'ble Supreme Court it\ninvolves an element of insulting the member of that community.\nOf course, this is a matter to be established in the course of\nevidence. According to the learned counsel for the petitioners, 5\nwitnesses have been arrayed to establish the factual allegations.\nDefinitely the evidence of the witnesses has to stand the test of\ncross examination. At this stage prima facie it cannot be said that\nthe ingredients of SC/ST (POA) Act is not made out and hence\nliable to be quashed, at the initial stage itself.\n\n6. Having considered these, | find no merit in the\ncontention set up by the petitioners and the Crl.M.C. is liable to\ndismissed. However, the petitioners will be entitled to raise all\ntheir objections before the court below and also urge the\n\n2017/KER/49288\nCri. M. C. No. 5307 of 2017 6\ncontentions raised here also. It is made clear that no finding is\narrived at regarding the allegations made by the petitioners\nherein and whatever conclusions mentioned above are only for\nthe limited purpose of considering whether the provision under\nSection 482 Cr.P.C. is liable to be invoked at this stage. Learned\ncounsel for the petitioners at this stage submitted that personal\nexemption of the petitioners may be permitted. If appropriate\napplication is filed, the court below may consider the applications\nin accordance with law.\nCrl.M.C. is dismissed as above.\nSd/-\n\nSUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE.\n\nPn\n\n"
