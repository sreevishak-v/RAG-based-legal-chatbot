The de facto complainant and the other persons\ninjured are arrayed as respondents 2 and 3.\nAnnexures-A2 and A3 affidavits have been filed by\nthe said respondents stating that the dispute, which\nwas the reason for the incident and registration of\nthe crime, has been resolved amicably and they have\nno subsisting grievance against the petitioners.\n\n2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also,\nwho, on instructions, submits that the petitioners\nhave no criminal antecedents.\n\n3. Having considered the gravity of the offences\n\nalleged, nature of the injury caused and having\n\nBLE\nOa\nCrl.MC.No.5064 OF 2020(C) Be. 202 UKER/TS312\nperused the affidavits filed by respondents 2 and 3,\nthe contents of which are submitted to be true and\nvoluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled\nand no public interest is involved in this matter. Even\nthough there is allegation of the petitioners having\ncommitted offence under Section 326 and the records\nshow that the de facto complainant had sustained\ngrievous injuries, considering the fact that an\namicable settlement has been arrived at between the\nparties, based on which, the de facto complainant,\nwho is arrayed the accused in Crime No.2055/2020 of\nthe Mangalapuram Police Station for the offences\npunishable under Sections 447, 341, 294(b), 323, 324\nand 354 r/w 34 of IPC, had approached this Court by\nfiling Criminal M.C.No.5058/2020, which was allowed\nby order dated 27.11.2020, I am inclined to grant the\nrelief sought. Moreover, in view of the settlement,\npossibility of the criminal proceedings ending in\n\nBeet\nCrl.MC.No.5064 OF 2020(C) An. 202 UKER/TS312\n\nconviction is remote. As such, continuance of the\nproceedings will amount to an abuse of process of\ncourt and hence, in view of the legal position set out\nby the Honourable Supreme Court in Madan Mohan\nAbbot v. State of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC 582] and\nGian Singh v. State of Punjab and another\n[(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is no impediment in\ngranting the relief sought.\n\nIn the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed.
