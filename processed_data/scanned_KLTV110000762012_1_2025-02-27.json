This case has arisen from a final report filed by the Sub Inspector of police,\nMuseum Police Station, in crime No. 718/12, alleging the commission of an\noffence against the accused under Sections 341,323 read with 34 of the Indian\nPenal Code.\n\n2. The prosecution case, in brief, is as follows:- The accused nos. 1 to 4 due\nto previous enmity with the informant, on 12.07.2012 with an intention to\ncause voluntarily hurt to the informant, accused nos.1 to 4 wrongfully\nrestrained the informant while he was travelling in a bike as pillion rider rode\nby witness no. 2 in the final report at 09.30 pm near Nanthencode, Plamoodu\njunction. When the motorcycle rode by witness no. 2 reached the said place\naccused nos. 1 to 4 in furtherance of common intention unlawfully restrained\nthe informant by intercepting the motorcycle. The 1* accused among them\nfisted on the left eye portion of the informant. At that time 2™ accused\nslapped on the cheek portion of the informant and other accused facilitated the\ncommission of offence in furtherance of the common intention among accused\nnos. 1 to 4. Thus accused nos. 1 to 4 alleged to have committed the offences\nunder Sections 341,323 read with 34 of the Indian Penal Code.\n\n3. On the issuance of summons, the accused no. 2 appeared before the court. The\naccused no. 2 was furnished with copies of prosecution records and thereby\ncomplied with the mandate under section 207 of the Criminal Procedure Code.\nThereafter, the accused no. 2 was heard on the charge levelled against him.\nParticulars of offences under Sections 341,323 read with 34 of the Indian\nPenal Code read over him and he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.\n\n4. From the side of the prosecution, the prosecution examined six witnesses as\n\nPW1 to PW6 and marked fourteen documents as Exts.P1 to P14. No defence\nevidence was adduced from the side of the defence.\n\n5. On the completion of prosecution evidence, the 2\"! accused was questioned\nunder section 313 (1) (b) of the Criminal Procedure Code, in which he denied\nall the incriminating circumstances appearing in prosecution evidence against\nhim.\n\n6. Heard the learned Assistant Public Prosecutor and the learned counsel for the\naccused.\n\n7. The points that arise for determination are as follows:-\n\n1 Didthe 2\" accused along with accused nos. 1,3 and 4 on 12.07.2012\nat 09.30 pm in furtherance of common intention due to previous\nenmity with PW1 attack PW1 near the place named Nanthencode,\nPlamoodu-Pattom while he was travelling along with PW4 in the final\nreport in his motorcycle as pillion rider and wrongfully restrained\nPW1 to proceed to the place in which he had the right to proceed\nand thus alleged to have committed the offence under Section 341\nread with 34 ofthe Indian Penal Code?\n\n2 Did the 2™ accused along with accused nos. 1, 3 and 4 on 12.07.2012\nat 09.30 pm in furtherance of common intention due to previous\nenmity with PW1 attack PW1 near the place named Nanthencode,\nPlamoodu-Pattom while he was travelling along with PW4 in the final\nreport in his motorcycle as pillion rider and the 1“ accused among\nthem attack PW1 and fisted on his left eye and 2\"! accused among\nthem slapped on his face and other accused persons facilitate the\ncommission of offence in furtherance of common intention and thus\nalleged to have committed the offence under Section 323 read with\n34 of the Indian Penal Code?\n\n3 Ifthe accused no. 2 is found guilty, what is the order as to sentence?\n\n8. Point No.1 and 2 :- PW1 deposed before the court that on 12.07.2012 at\n\n09.00 pm while he was travelling ‘long with his friend named Kannan and\nproceeded to Jubilee Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram. At the time when he was\ntraveling on the bike rode by PW4 and reached at Pattom — Plamoodu\njunction, the accused persons intercepted the vehicle. The 1“ and 2™ accused\namong them slapped on his face. PW1 further deposed that except the 1* and\n2™¢ accused none other accused attacked him. This incident was happened due\nto a previous enmity with PW1 regarding a compromise between seniors and\njuniors of Muslim Association Engineering College, Venjarammoodu in\nconnection with an incident occurred in Muslim Association Engineering\nCollege, Venjarammoodu. In that college the PW1 and the accused persons\nwere studying at the time of the incident. The matter was informed to the\npolice by PW1.\n\n9. PW2 deposed before the court that while he had been working as Assistant\nProfessor of Govt. Dental College, Thiruvananthapuram as Oral and Maxio\nfacial surgery department he had examined PW1 on 12.07.2012 at 10.00 pm\nwith an alleged history of assault by the accused towards PW1. He had exam-\nined the PW1 and issued Ext P2 wound certificate.\n\n10. PW3 deposed before the court that while he had been working as a Civil Po-\nlice Officer in Museum Police Station he was an attestor to the Ext P3 seizure\nmahazar prepared by the investigating officer in this case.\n\n11. PW4 deposed before the court that he along with PW1 while travelling in his\nbike to Jubilee Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram on 12.07.2012 at 09.00 pm and\nreached Plamoodu junction, some persons intercepted his vehicle and attacked\nPW1 and voluntarily caused hurt to him.\n\n12. PW5 deposed before the court that while he had been working as Station\nHouse Officer of Museum Police Station he had registered the FIR in this case,\nprepared body note, proceeded to the place of occurrence and prepared\nmahazar, identified the accused, filed report, proceeded with the investigation\nand filed a final report in this case.\n\n13. PW6 deposed before the court that he was an ocular witness to the incident\nthat happened on 12.07.2012 at 09.00 pm. On that day PW1 while travelling\n\nalong with PW4 in a motorcycle rode by PW1 accused nos. 1 to 4 intercepted\nthe said motorcycle rode by PW4 at the place near Plamoodu junction. The\naccused nos. 1 to 4 attacked PW1 and he was injured by the attack of the\naccused. He had witnessed all these incidents in the presence of street light.\nPW1 was taken to the hospital after the incident.\n\n14. For the sake of convenience point no. 1 and 2 are to be considered together. In\nthis case, from the side of the prosecution, the prosecution cited seven\nwitnesses among it the prosecution could examine six witnesses as PW1 to\nPW6 and marked fourteen documents as Ext P1 to P14. In this case, PW1\nwho is the injured in this case and PW6 who is the ocular witness to this\nincident are the independent witnesses who supported the prosecution case.\nThis court could not procure the attendance of witness no. 4 in the final report\neven after taking coercive steps. The remaining witnesses except PW4 are\nofficial witnesses who supported the prosecution case. PW4 is an ocular\nwitness who had not supported the prosecution case in its fullest extend.\n\n15. During the time of argument a pertinent question that arises for consideration\nis whether the evidence of the prosecution witness are sufficient to prove the\nprosecution case beyond reasonable doubt. The reason is that only two\nindependent witnesses from the side of the prosecution supported the case of\nthe prosecution. Now let me examine this aspect based on Section 134 of the\nIndian Evidence Act reads as follows:-\n\nSection 134 of the Indian Evidence Act— Number of witnesses- No\nparticular number of witnesses shall in any case be required for the\nproof of any fact.\n\n16. Law is well settled that as a general rule, the court can act on the testimony of\na single witness provided he or she is wholly reliable. In fact, it is not the\nnumbers, the quantity, but the quality that is material. Time honoured principle\nis that evidence has to be weighed and not counted. The test is whether the\nevidence has a ring of truth, credible, cogent and trustworthy.\n\n17.In Namdeo V. State of Maharashtra (2007 ) 14 SCC 150 the Hon/’ble\nSupreme Court of India re-iterated this view observing that it is the quality\n\nand not the quantity of evidence vihich is material. Quantity of evidence was\nnever considered to be a test for deciding a criminal trial. The legal system\nhas emphasized value, weight and quality of evidence rather than on quantity,\nmultiplicity or plurality of witnesses. So itis opened to the continent court to\nfully and completely rely on a solitary witness.\n\n18. In Kunju @ Balachandran V. State of Tamil Nadu reported in AIR 2008 SCC\n1381, Jagdish Prasad V. State of Madhya Pradesh AIR 1994 SCC 1251,\nVadivelu Thevar V. State of Madras AIR 1957 SCC 616 the Hon’ble Supreme\nCourt of India reiterated the same view by placing the position under Section\n134 of the Indian Evidence Act.\n\n19.In Yakub Ismailbhai Patel V. State of Gujarath (2004) 12 SCC 229 the\nHon’ble Supreme Court of India held that the legal position in respect of\ntestimony of solitary eye witness is well settled in a canton of judgments.\nWhile looking into such evidence the court has always advocated the rule of\ncaution and such corroboration from other evidence and even in the absence of\ncorroboration if the testimony of the single witness inspires confidence then\nthe condition can based solely appointed.\n\n20. In the State of Haryana V. Inder Singh reported in (2002) 9 SCC the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court of India held that it is not a quantity but the quality of the\nwitnesses which matters for determining the guilty or innocent of the accused\nin a criminal case. So in the light of the canton of the decision discussed above\nthis court is of the view that even though PW4 who is the friend of PW1 who\nwas present along with PW1 at the time of the alleged incident turned hostile to\nthe prosecution does not destroy the prosecution case in its entirety and court\ncan rely upon the evidence of solitary witness if it has a ring of truth and\ninspires, cogent, credible and trustworthy. Here in this case, based on the\ndecision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India above mentioned the court can\nrely on the evidence of remaining prosecution witnesses. So the contention\nput forward by the defence counsel regarding the trustworthiness of PW4, the\nocular witness to the incident which destroy the prosecution case in its entirety\nwould not sustain in this case based on the above decision. Now let me\n\nexamine whether the evidence of ‘the remaining witnesses as cited by the\nprosecution as PW1 to PW6 could be sufficient to prove the prosecution case\nbeyond reasonable doubt.\n\n21.1 have analyzed the evidence of PW1 to PW6. It is brought out from the\nevidence of PW1 that he was attacked by 1% and 2™ accused. PW1\ncategorically deposed that accused nos. 1 and 2 voluntarily caused hurt to him\nand none others. So it is clear from the evidence that PW1 was attacked by\naccused nos. 1 and 2. By pointing to accused no. 4 who was present in the\ndock, PW1 deposed that he had stopped the vehicle. During the cross\nexamination, PW1 categorically deposed that none of the accused intercepted\nthe bike travelled by PW1 and wrongfully restrained him. It is pertinent to\nnote that in order to constitute an offence under Section 341 of the Indian\nPenal Code it must be proved by the prosecution that the accused voluntarily\nobstructed PW1 so as to prevent him from proceeding in any direction in\nwhich he had the right to proceed. Here by taking the evidence of PW1, it is\nclear that he was not obstructed by the accused so as to attract the offence\nunder Section 341 of the Indian Penal Code. Moreover, PW6, one of the\nocular witness who supported the prosecution case also not stated that the ac-\ncused wrongfully restrained PW1 so as to prevent him to proceed to a partic-\nular direction to which he had the right to proceed. So the prosecution has\nfailed to prove the offence alleged against the accused u/s. 341 of the Indian\nPenal Code beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n22. Then regarding the offence alleged u/s. 323 of the Indian Penal Code I have\nscrutinized the evidence of PW1, PW2 and PW6. PW1 categorically stated\nthat he was attacked by accused nos. 1 and 2 and voluntarily caused hurt to\nhim. PW1 identified accused nos. 1 and 2 and had previous acquaintance with\naccused nos. 1 and 2 as both PW1 and accused nos. 1 and 2 were studying in\nthe same college. So there is no identification dispute with regard to the\nidentity of accused nos. 1 and 2. PW1 stated about the motive for the\ncommission of the offence by accused nos. 1 and 2 ie, with regard to a dispute\nthat happened between PW1 and accused nos. 1 and 2 in their college. PW1\n\nclearly stated about the specific overt act of accused nos. 1 and 2 which caused\nhurt to PW1. Even though PW1 was subjected to lengthy cross examination\nnothing was brought about from the evidence of PW1 to discredit the version\nwith regard to the voluntarily causing hurt to PW1 by accused nos. 1 and 2\nexcept the evidence with regard to a connected case vide crime no. 757/2012\nof Venjarammoodu police station registered against PW1. The fact of crime\nno. 757/2012 is reflected in Ext P4 FIS. On perusal, it is seen that PW1 was\narrested in connection with a crime no. 757/2012 and kept in police custody.\nOn getting the information Museum police reached there and collected\ninformation about this case and registered crime against the accused persons.\nSo even though defence counsel subjected PW1 to a lengthy cross\nexamination nothing was brought out to discredit the version regarding the\noffence under Section 323 of the Indian Penal Code stated in the\nexamination-in-chief.\n\n23. Then [ gone through the evidence of PW2 the doctor who examined PW1. It\nis brought out from the evidence of PW2 that he had examined PW1 on the\nsame day of the incident ie, on 12.07.2012 at 10.00 pm. In the 10\" column of\nthe Ext P2 document prepared by PW2, it is seen that PW1 sustained\ncontusion below the left eye and sub conjunctional hemorrhage below the left\neye. PW2 explained about the sub conjunctional hemorrhage as_ tracking of\nblood below the eye. PW2 opined that it may be caused as alleged by PW1.\nThe wound certificate was marked as Ext P2 through PW2. It is pertinent to\nnote that the learned predecessor of this court recorded in the deposition paper\nthat defence counsel is represented and sought for time for cross examination.\nThe said prayer was disallowed by the learned predecessor of this court and\nrecorded no cross examination. Thereafter defence counsel has not taken any\nsteps to procure the attendance of PW2 for the purpose of cross examination.\nIt is pertinent to note that PW1 categorically deposed about the specific overt\nact of accused nos. 1 and 2 and specifically stated about the nature of injuries\nsustained to him by the attack of accused nos. 1 and 2. While arguing this\nmatter the learned counsel for the accused stated that even though PW1 is\n\nacquainted with accused nos. 1 and 2 he did not state the name of accused nos.\n1 and 2 before the doctor, PW2 at the time when PW1 went to the hospital for\ntreatment. It is pertinent to note that in Babu v. State reported in 1994(1) SC\n388 it is held that it is a matter of common knowledge that the entry in the\nwound certificate or injury certificate does not necessarily amount to a\nstatement. It is not the duty of the doctor to enquire from the injured patient\nabout the actual assailants, the nature of the weapon used and such other\ndetails. Moreover, it is neither the job and nor can it be expected from the\ndoctor to record a detailed statement. This aspect is also discussed in the light\nof the decision in Chikkragaiah v. State of Karnataka reported in ATR 2009\nSC (supp) 2646. So the above contention put forward by the learned defence\ncounsel would not sustain in this case.\n\n24. As I discussed earlier that PW1 not deposed about the role of accused nos. 3\nand 4 for voluntarily causing hurt to him. In this case, the evidence of PW1\nregarding the voluntarily caused hurt to him by accused nos. 1 and 2 is\ncorroborated by the medical evidence of PW2 who also stated that the injuries\nsustained to PW1 might be caused as alleged by PW1. Then PW6 another\nocular witness also stated that he was attacked by accused nos. 1 and 2 and\nsustained injuries to PW1 in the manner stated by PW1. PW6 identified the\naccused at the time of the incident in the presence of a street light and later\nidentified accused no. 1 in the dock. But he could not recollect 2™ accused at\nthe time of identification in the dock. Even though PW6 was subjected to\ncross examination he denied the suggestive question put forward by the\ndefence counsel that he had not witnessed the incident. Then regarding non\nidentification of 2\" accused by PW6 in the dock, I am of the opinion that in\ncriminal cases, normal discrepancies are bound to occur in the deposition of\nwitnesses due to lack of time and such other reasons. Minor contradictions,\ninconsistencies, embellishments or improvements on trivial matters which do\nnot affect the core of the prosecution case should not be made a ground on\nwhich the evidence can be rejected in its entirety. The court has to form its\nopinion about the credibility of the witness and record a finding whether his\n\ndeposition inspires, confidence, trustworthy and is reliable. Therefore mere\nmarginal variation of the statement of witnesses cannot be treated as\nimprovements and the same may be the elaborations of the statements made by\nthe witnesses earlier. These aspects were discussed by the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt of India in Inspector of Police V. Saravana AIR 2009 SCC 152,\nArumugom V. State AIR 2009 SCC 331, Mahendra Pratap Singh V. State of\nUttar Pradesh (2009) 11 SCC 334 and Dr. Sunilkumar Sambhudayal\nGupta and Others Vs. State of Maharashtra 2010 (12) SCC 287.\n\n25. So on analysing the evidence of PW1 and PW6, I am of the opinion that the\nevidence of PW1 and PW6 contains minor variations which should not be\ntaken into consideration while assessing the reliability of testimony of PW1\nand PW6 in toto and the consistency of prosecution version as a whole. It is\npertinent to note that no prosecution case is foolproof at the same is bound to\nsuffer from some lacunae or the other. It is only when such lacunae are on\nmaterial aspects going to the root of the prosecution case, that it may have\nbearing on the outcome of the prosecution case, else such shortcomings are to\nbe ignored. It is pertinent to note that when an incident takes place, one\ncannot expect a scribed version from witnesses to show as to what actually\nhappened and in what manner it had happened. Such minor details may have\nneither noticed by people since they are fury of the incident and apprehended\nof what may happen in future. A witness is not expected to recreate a scene\nas if it was short after with a scribed version but what material thing has\nhappen that is only noticed or remembered by people and that will be stated in\nevidence. Here in this case on analysing the evidence of PW1 and other\nwitnesses regarding the evidence given by prosecution witness in the brought\nnarration, there is no material contradiction so as to render the evidence so\nself contradictory as to make it untrustworthy. In this case, the evidence of\nPWo5 who conducted the investigation also corroborated with the evidence of\nthe PW1 regarding the manner in which the incident had happened as narrated\nby PW1.\n\n26.PW3 who is an attesting witness to Ext P3 seizure mahazar clearly deposed\n\nabout his presence at the time of preparing the mahazar and also Ext P12\nmahazar marked through PW5 clearly deposed about the place of incident as\nper Ext P12 mahazar and that portion was not discredited by the defence\ncounsel. The medical evidence of PW2 is corroborated with the evidence of\nPW1 regarding the nature of injury sustained to PW1. On evaluating the all\nthe evidence in the light of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India as discussed\nabove this court finds that the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable\ndoubt that accused no.2 on 12.07.2012 at 09.30 pm at the place near Nanthen-\ncode, Plamoodu junction attacked PW1 and caused voluntarily hurt to his left\neye and committed the offence under Section 323 of the Indian Penal Code.\n\n27. Point No. 3:- Based on the elaborated discussion made by analysing the\nevidence of PW1 to PW6 and Ext P1 to P14 this court finds that accused\nno. 2 is found guilty under Section 323 read with 34 of the Indian Penal\nCode in this case. Accused no. 2 is not found guilty under Section 341 read\nwith 34 of the Indian Penal Code.\n\n28. Then regarding the appropriate sentence should be given to accused no. 2 for\nthe offence under Section 323 of the Indian Penal Code I have referred the\ndecision of Sumer Singh V. Suraj Bhan Singh (2014) 7 SCC 323, Sham\nSundar V. Puran (1990) 4 SCC 731, MP V. Saleem (2005) 5 SCC 554 and\nRavji V. State of Rajasthan (1996) 2 SCC 175 the Hon’ble Supreme Court of\nIndia held that it is a settled legal position that appropriate sentence should\nbe awarded after giving due consideration of fact and circumstances of each\ncase, nature of the offence and the manner in which it was executed or\ncommitted. The measure of punishment should be proportionate to be gravity\nof offence. The object of sentence should be to protect of society and to\ndeter the criminal in achieving the avowed object of the law. The court will be\nfailing its duty if appropriate punishment is not awarded for a crime which has\nbeen committed not only against the individual victim but also against the\nsociety. In this case, the light of the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of\nIndian and based on the discussions above mentioned by considering the facts\nand circumstances of the case, the nature of the offence, most particularly the\n\nnature of the injury sustained the Vital part of the body of the victim, I am of\nthe opinion that the punishment awarded to accused no. 2. should be\nconsistent with the atrocity and brutality committed by accused no. 2 against\nPW1 and the brutality which the crime has been perpetrated, enormity of\ncrime warranting public abhorrence and it should respond to the societies cry\nfor justice against the criminal activities. Hence considering the totality of\nfacts and circumstances of the case, motive, nature of the offence, nature of\nthe accusation, nature of the injury sustained to PW1 and the manner in which\nsuch injury was caused by accused no.2 to the vital part of PW1 I am of the\nopinion that maximum punishment should be given to the accused no. 2 for the\noffence under Section 323 of the Indian Penal Code against accused no. 2.\n\n29. In the result, accused no. 2 is found guilty under Section 323 read with 34 of\nthe Indian Penal Code and convicted w/s. 255(2) of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure and sentenced to imprisonment for a period of one year and a fine\nof Rs. 1,000/- . The fine amount of Rs. 1,000/- shall be paid by accused no. 2\nto PW1 as a part of compensation under Section 357(1) of the Criminal\nProcedure Code. Accused no.2 is not found guilty of the offence under Section\n341 read with 34 of the Indian Penal Code and acquitted under Section 255(1)\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure. The case against accused nos. 1, 3 and 4\nis split up and refiled as CC.435/2025.\n\n(Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected and\npronounced by me, in open court, on this the 27\" day of February 2025 )\nSd/-\nJudicial Magistrate of the First Class— III\nThiruvananthapuram\n\n14\nAPPENDIX\nWitnesses for Prosecution:\nPW1/CW1 : Nijin Shajahan. informant examined on 04.12.2015\nPW2/CW6 : Dr. Dain C Pearl, Expert witness examined on 14.03.16\nPW3/CWos : Manoj Kumar, mahazar witness examined on 29.11.16.\nPW4/CW2 : Kannan, occurrence witness examined on 19.09.17\nPW5/CW7 : J.
