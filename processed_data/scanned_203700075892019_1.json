A\ncase was registered as O.R.No.3/2019 of the Ezhamkulam Forest\nStation in the matter. The snake was seized, while four persons,\ntwo men and two women, were engaged in the trading of the\nsnake in a house. The aforesaid four persons, who are accused 1\nto 4, were arrested from the spot by the Forest Range Officer.\n2. The interrogation of the accused revealed that the\n\nsnake was kept and transported in the cars bearing Reg.Nos.KL-\n16L 2831 and KL-16K 5122. The Forest Range Officer also seized\n\nGlaze\nmee\nripe\n2020/KER/130\nCr1.M.C.Nos.7589/2019\n& 4\n7596/2019\nthe aforesaid cars.\n3. The third accused filed an application under Section\n451 CrP.C before the Judicial First Class Magistrate-II (Forest\nOffences), Punalur for releasing the car bearing Reg.No.KL-16K\n5122 to his interim custody. The first accused filed an application\nunder Section 451 Cr.P.C before the same court for releasing the\ncar KL-16L 2831 to her interim custody. Both the aforesaid\napplications were allowed by the learned Magistrate on the\ncondition that they shall execute a bond for Rs.5,00,000/- and\nRs.3,00,000/- respectively and also on the condition that they\nshall not alienate or dispose of the vehicle or make any alteration\nto it and they shall produce the vehicle as and when directed by\nthe court. The State has filed these petitions under Section 482\nCr.P.C challenging the orders passed by the learned Magistrate\ngranting interim custody of the aforesaid vehicles to the aforesaid\npersons.\n4. Heard learned Special Public Prosecutor (Forest) and\nalso the learned counsel for the respondent in the two petitions.\n5. Learned Special Public Prosecutor contended that,\n\neer\n2 eo\nBears\nripe\n2020/KER/130\nCr1.M.C.Nos.7589/2019\n& bs)\n7596/2019\nthough the Magistrate has got ample power under Section 451\nCr.P.C to release the vehicles to the interim custody of proper\npersons, the Magistrate has to exercise his discretion properly.\nLearned Special Public Prosecutor would contend that the\nvehicles seized under the provisions of the Act cannot be\nreleased in a casual and mechanical manner. Learned Special\nPublic Prosecutor further contended that the learned Magistrate\nhas passed the orders releasing the cars to the interim custody of\nthe accused in the case without properly considering the\nobjections raised by the Forest Range Officer.\n\n6. Per contra, learned counsel who appeared for the\nrespondent in the two petitions, contended that the learned\nMagistrate has exercised the discretion in the proper manner\nespecially in view of the directions given by the Apex Court in the\ndecision in Sunderbhai Ambalal Desai v. State of Gujarat :\nAIR 2003 SC 638 and this Court may not interfere with the\norders passed by the learned Magistrate.\n\n7. Section 39(1)(d) of the Act provides that every\nvehicle, vessel, weapon, trap or tool used for committing an\n\nPie izael\n2 eo\nPees\nape\n2020/KER/130\nCr1.M.C.Nos.7589/2019\n& 6\n7596/2019\noffence and has been seized under the provisions of the Act shall\nbe the property of the State Government. It is further provided\nthat when an animal is hunted in a sanctuary or National Park,\nany vehicle, vessel, weapon, trap or tool used in such hunting\nshall be the property of the Central Government.\n\n8. Section 50(1)(c) of the Act states that, an authorised\nofficer or any forest officer, who has reasonable grounds for\nbelieving that any person has committed an offence against the\nAct, has the power to seize any trap, tool, vehicle, vessel or\nweapon used for committing such offence under the Act. Section\n50(4) of the Act provides that, any person detained, or things\nseized under such power shall forthwith be taken before the\nMagistrate to be dealt with according to law.\n\n9. In State of U.P v. Lalloo Singh : (2007) 7 SCC\n334, the Supreme Court has considered the scope of the\nprovisions contained in Sections 39 and 50 of the Act and it has\nbeen held as follows:\n\n“Clause (d) of sub-section (1) of Section 39\ndeals with a situation when any vehicle, vessel,\nweapon, trap or too! has been used for committing\n\nBee\nFe\n—\n2020/KER/130\nCr1.M.C.Nos.7589/2019\n& 7\n7596/2019\nan offence and has been seized under the\nprovisions of the Act. The twin conditions are that\nthe vehicle etc. must have been used for\ncommitting an offence and has been seized. Mere\nseizure of the property without any material to\nshow that the same has been used for committing\nan offence does not make the seized property, the\nproperty of the Government. At this juncture, it is\nalso to be noted that under sub-section (1) of\nSection 50 action can be taken if the concerned\nOfficial has reasonable grounds for believing that\nany person has committed an offence under the\nAct. In other words, there has to be a reasonable\nground for belief that an offence has been\ncommitted. When any person is detained or things\nseized are taken before the magistrate, he has the\npower to deal with the same “in accordance with\nlaw.”\nThe Supreme Court has further held as follows:\n“There is a significant addition in sub-section\n(4) by Act 16 of 2003 i.e. requirement of\nintimation to the Chief Wild Life Warden or the\nofficer authorized in this regard as to the action to\nbe taken by the Magistrate when the seized\nproperty is taken before a Magistrate. A combined\nreading of the omitted sub-section (2) and the\nsubstituted sub-section (3A) of the Section 50\n\nFe\n2020/KER/130\nCr1.M.C.Nos.7589/2019\n& 8\n7596/2019\nmakes the position clear that prior to the omission,\nthe officials under the Act had the power to direct\nrelease of the seized article. Under sub-section\n(1), the power for giving temporary custody\nsubject to the condition that the same shall be\nproduced if and when required by the magistrate is\nindicative of the fact that the Magistrate can pass\nappropriate orders in respect of the purported\nseized property which is taken before him. While\ndealing with an application for temporary release\nof custody, there cannot be a_ complete\nadjudication of the issues involved as the same is a\nmatter for trial.”\n(emphasis supplied).\nThe Supreme Court had proceeded to hold as follows:\n\n“While dealing with the application the\nMagistrate has to take into account the statutory\nmandate that the seized property becomes the\nproperty of the State Government when the same\nhas been used for commission of an offence under\nthe Act and has been seized.\n\nIt appears that insertion in sub-section (4)\nrelating to the intimation to the Chief Wild Life\nofficer or the officer authorized by him is intended\nto give concerned official an opportunity of placing\nrelevant materials on record before the Magistrate\n\nOre\n2 ie\npons\nCap\n2020/KER/130\nCr1.M.C.Nos.7589/2019\n& 9\n7596/2019\npasses any order relating to release or custody. In\nappropriate cases on consideration of materials\nplaced before him, prayer for such release or\ncustody can be rejected.\nIt is to be noted that under sub-section (1)\nof Section 50 for the purpose of entry, seizure,\narrest and detention the official has to form the\nbelief on reasonable grounds that the person has\ncommitted an offence under the Act. The\nMagistrate is, therefore, required to consider these\naspects while dealing with the application as noted\nabove. It cannot be a routine exercise.”\n(emphasis supplied).\n\n10. In State of M.P v. Madhukar Rao : (2008) 14 SCC\n624 also, the Supreme Court had occasion to consider the scope\nof Sections 39 and 50 of the Act. It has been held by the Apex\nCourt that the Magistrate has power under Section 451 Cr.P.C to\nmake an order for interim release of the vehicle.\n\n11. In the instant cases, in the order passed by the\nlearned Magistrate releasing the car KL-16K 5122 to the interim\ncustody of the third accused, it is stated that the vehicle was\nseized from the aforesaid accused and he is a person who had\npurchased the vehicle from the registered owner and that the\n\nCiara\na son\nBears\nripe\n2020/KER/130\nCr1.M.C.Nos.7589/2019\n& 10\n7596/2019\nregistered owner had no objection to release the vehicle to the\nthird accused and also that further keeping the vehicle in the\ncustody of the court would cause deterioration of its value.\nLearned Magistrate released the vehicle to the interim custody of\nthe third accused for the aforesaid reasons.\n\n12. In the order passed by the learned Magistrate\nreleasing the vehicle KL-16L 2831 to the interim custody of the\nfirst accused, it is stated that the first accused is the registered\nowner of the vehicle and that further keeping the vehicle in the\ncustody of the court will only cause deterioration of its value.\nLearned Magistrate released the vehicle to the interim custody of\nthe first accused for the aforesaid reasons.\n\n13. The Forest Range Officer concerned had filed objection\nto both applications raising various grounds. I find force in the\ncontention of the learned Special Public Prosecutor that the\nlearned Magistrate did not consider any of the objections raised\nby the Forest Range Officer against the releasing of the vehicles\nto the interim custody of the accused. The learned Magistrate\nhas granted interim custody of the vehicles to the accused only\n\nCiara\na son\nBears\nripe\n2020/KER/130\nCr1.M.C.Nos.7589/2019\n& 11\n7596/2019\nfor the reason that further keeping of the vehicles in the custody\nof the court will cause deterioration to the value of the vehicles.\nOf course, it is certainly one of the factors to be taken into\naccount while granting interim custody of a vehicle. It is the\nspirit of the decision of the Supreme Court in Sunderbhai\n(supra). But, while dealing with applications filed under Section\n451 Cr.P.C for releasing the vehicles, which have been seized\nunder the special statutes like Wild Life Protection Act, Forest Act\netc., the Magistrates have also to take into consideration other\nfactors also as indicated by the Supreme Court in Lalloo Singh\n(supra). They have to consider and dispose of such applications\nnot in a routine manner but after taking into consideration the\nobjections raised by the investigating officer or the Forest Officer\nor the Wild Life Protection Officer concerned. In the instant\ncases, the learned Magistrate has passed orders releasing the\nvehicles to the interim custody of the accused in a routine\nmanner without taking into consideration any of the objections\nraised by the Forest Range Officer.\n14. In the aforesaid circumstances, I find that it is only\n\niit\nripe\n2020/KER/130\nCr1.M.C.Nos.7589/2019\n& 12\n7596/2019\nproper to remit the applications filed under Section 451 CrP.C by\nthe respondent/accused in the two. petitions for fresh\nconsideration by the learned Magistrate in the light of the\ndecision of the Supreme Court in Lalloo Singh (supra).\n\n15. Consequently, the petitions are allowed. The orders\npassed by the learned Magistrate granting interim custody of the\nvehicles to the accused, which are impugned in these Crl.M.Cs,\nare set aside. The applications, Crl.M.P.Nos.6932/2019 and\n6893/2019 filed in O.R.No.3/2019 of the Ezhamkulam Forest\nStation, for granting interim custody of the vehicles, are remitted\nto the learned Magistrate for fresh consideration and disposal in\naccordance with law. Learned Magistrate shall dispose of the\naforesaid applications afresh within a period of two weeks from\nthe date of production of a certified copy of this order before the\ncourt. It is made clear that this Court has not made any findings\nwith regard to the merits of the claim made by the applicants for\ngetting interim custody of the vehicles.\n\n(sd/-)\nR.NARAYANA PISHARADI, JUDGE\njsr\n\nBese\n= ee\nEl iw\n2020/KER/130\nCr1.M.C.Nos.7589/2019\n& 13\n7596/2019\nAPPENDIX OF Crl1.MC 7589/2019\nPETITIONER'S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE Al A COPY OF THE FOREST OFFENCE IN OR NO.\n3/2019 OF EZHUMKULAM FOREST STATION\nANNEXURE-A2 A COPY OF THE MAHAZAR IN OR NO.3/2019 OF\nEZHUMKULAM FOREST STATION\nANNEXURE A3 A COPY OF PETITION UNDER SECTION 451 OF\nCR.P.C BEFORE THE JUDICIAL FIRST CLASS\nMAGISTRATE COURT-II (FOREST OFFENCES) ,\nPUNALUR\nANNEXURE A4 A COPY OF THE OBJECTION IN THE FORM OF\nREPORT FILED BY THE PETITIONER IN CMP\nNO. 6932/2019\nANNEXURE A5 A TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER DATED 25-10-\n2019 IN C.M.P NO. 6932/19 IN O.R NO.\n3/2019 OF EZHAMKULAM FOREST STATION OF\nJUDICIAL FIRST CLASS MAGISTRATE-II\n(FOREST OFFENCES) PUNALUR.\nANNEXURE A6 TRUE COPY OF THE EXPLANATION SUBMITTED\nBY THE DFO DATED 04.11.2019\nANNEXURE A7 TRUE COPY OF THE OFFICE MEMORANDUM\nDATED 06.11.2019\nRESPONDENT'S EXHIBITS: NIL\n\nBis\n2020/KER/130\nAPPENDIX OF Cri.MC 7596/2019\nPETITIONER'S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE Al A COPY OF THE FOREST OFFENCE IN OR\nNO.3/2019 OF EZHUMKULAM FOREST STATION.\nANNEXURE A2 A COPY OF THE MAHAZARIN OF EZHUMKULAM\nFOREST STATION.\nANNEXURE A3 A COPY OF THE OBJECTION IN THE FORM OF\nREPORT FILED BY THE PETITIONER IN CMP\nNO.6893/2019.\nANNEXURE A4 A CERTIFIED COPY OF THE ORDER DATED\n25.10.2019 IN C.M.P.NO.6893/19 IN O.R.\nNO.3/2019 OF EZHAMKULAM FOREST STATION OF\nJUDICIAL FIRST CLASS MAGISTRATE-II (FOREST\nOFFENCES) PUNALUR.\nRESPONDENT'S EXHIBITS: NIL\nTRUE COPY\nPS TO JUDGE\n\n"
