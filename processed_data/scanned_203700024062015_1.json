It is alleged in the petitions that, the first\npetitioner is the managing partner of the firm Mount\nCrescent Construction, of which second petitioner was an\nemployee. During the period from 1986-1996, certain\nmalpractices were committed by the second petitioner and\nan amount of %84,227/- was misappropriated. So the first\npetitioner filed a complaint on the basis of which Crime\nNo.455/1999 was registered and after investigation three\nseparate charge-sheets were filed on the basis of which the\ncases have been taken on file as C.C.No.1077/2006,\n\nnoes\n2015/KER/17319\n\nCri. M.C. Nos.2406, 2431 and 2435 of 2015\n\n1076/2006 and 1075/2006 on the file of the Judicial First\nClass Magistrate Court-I, Kasaragod. Now the matter has\nbeen settled between the parties and the entire amount due\nhas been paid as per the agreement. Since the entire\namount has been paid and it is only a monitory dispute\narose between the employee and the employer, the first\npetitioner does not want to prosecute the second petitioner.\nSince some of the offences are non-compoundable in nature,\nthey cannot file application before the court below. So the\npetitioners have filed the above petitions for quashing the\nproceedings.\n\n3. Learned Public Prosecutor submitted that,\nexcept these cases, there is no other case against the\nsecond petitioner and it was a business relationship\nbetween the parties in which certain amounts have been\nmisappropriated by the second petitioner. Since more than\nthree offences have been committed, within a span of more\nthan one year, three separate charge-sheet have been filed\nand these cases have been taken on file.\n\nnoes\n2015/KER/17319\n\nCri. M.C. Nos.2406, 2431 and 2435 of 2015\n\n4. Heard the counsel for the petitioners as well.\n\n5. It is an admitted fact that first petitioner is\nthe partner of the firm Mount Crescent Construction and\nsecond petitioner was working as employee under them. He\nwas working there from 1986-1996. Later it was revealed\nthat, second petitioner had committed some\nmisappropriation to the tune of %84,227/- during this period.\nWhen this was found out, on the basis of the complaint\ngiven by the first petitioner, Crime No.455/1999 was\nregistered and after investigation three separate charge-\nsheets were filed against the second petitioner and on the\nbasis of which three cases have been taken on file as\nC.C.No.1077/2006, 1076/2006 and 1075/2006 respectively\non the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,\nKasaragod. It is seen from Annexure-III agreement that,\nthe matter has been settled between the parties and the\nentire amount due has been paid as well and this settlement\nwas arrived at due to the intervention of well-wishers of\nboth the parties. In view of the settlement, first petitioner\n\nnoes\n2015/KER/17319\n\nCri. M.C. Nos.2406, 2431 and 2435 of 2015\nhad agreed to withdraw the prosecution and it is on the\nbasis of which these petitions have been filed. Though\ncertain offences are non- compoundable in nature, there is\nno evidence to show that any forgery has been committed\nor any manipulation of accounts has been committed. But\ncertain amounts entrusted while he was working under the\nfirst petitioner were seen misappropriated by the second\npetitioner, which he later admitted and paid in the\nmediation held between the parties due to the intervention\nof well-wishers of both parties. Since the matter has been\nsettled between the parties and both the _ defacto-\ncomplainant/ accused have jointly filed this petition for\nquashing the proceedings, no purpose will be served by\nproceeding the case as well, as they are not going to\nsupport the case of the prosecution.\n\n6. Further in the decision reported in Gian\nSingh v. State of Panjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], the\nHon’ble Supreme Court has held that, in cases where\npersonal disputes and matrimonial disputes, or monitory\n\nnoes\n2015/KER/17319\n\nCri. M.C. Nos.2406, 2431 and 2435 of 2015\n\ndispute of criminal nature resulted in registration of crime\n\nand the matter has been settled between the parties, even\nthough certain non-compoundable offence has been\nincorporated in order to honour the settlement, court must\ninvoke the power under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure to quash the proceedings.\n\n7. In view of the dictum laid down in the above\ndecision, and also considering the fact that it is a dispute\nbetween the employer and employee and relating to\nmonitory dispute between them, which has been settled due\nto the intervention of mediators and the entire amount said\nto have been misappropriated has been paid and other\noffences namely, offence under Section 465, 468 and 477A\nhave not been made even on the basis of evidence, this\ncourt feels that, there is no purpose in proceeding the case,\nas the possibility of conviction is remote and proceeding the\ncases will only amount to wastage of judicial time. So this\ncourt feels that, it is a fit case where the power under\nSection 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure has to be\n\nBlpmaiasel\npe\n2015/KER/17319\nCrl. M.C. Nos.2406, 2431 and 2435 of 2015\n6\n\ninvoked to quash the proceedings, so as to honour the\nsettlement entered into between the parties and also to\npromote the relationship that has been restored between\nthe parties on account of the settlement. The pendency of\nthis case should not be a hurdle for the same.\n\nSo the applications are allowed and further\nproceedings in C.C.No.1077/2006, C.C.No.1076/2006 and\nC.C.No.1075/2006 (arising out of Crime No.455/1999 of\nJudicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kasaragod) pending\nbefore the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,\nKasaragod, as against the second petitioner are quashed",
