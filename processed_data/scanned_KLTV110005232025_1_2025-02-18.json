Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and learned Assistant Public\nProsecutor.\n\n5. On the perusal of report filed by Sub Inspector of Police, Thampanoor Police\nStation and petition filed by petitioner, I am prima facie satisfied that, the\npetitioner is the owner of the High Beem Pillar plates and he is entitled to\nthe immediate possession of same. The High Beem Pillar plates were seized\nby the Thampanoor Police in Crime No. 742/2024 and were produced before\nthis court.

It was further held that the owner of the\narticles would not suffer because of its remaining unused or by its\nmisappropriation. The Court of police would not be required to keep the\narticles in safe custody.

Considering the submissions of learned counsel for the petitioner and learned\nAssistant Public Prosecutor on hearing and on perusal of prosecution records,\nthis court is of the opinion that the High Beem Pillar plates remains unused\nand kept in this court for a long period it may cause damage to the said\narticles and the petitioner will be put to great hardship.
