V. SREEJA (PP)\n\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n\n17.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\na\n2024/KER/4678\nCRL.MC NO. 481 OF 2024\n2\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.\nCri.M.C.No.481 of 2024\nDated this the 17\" day of January 2024\nORDER\n\nPetitioner is aggrieved by Conditions No.2 and 3 imposed in the\norder dated 26.12.2023 while granting him statutory bail in Crl.M.C\nNo.1830/2023 by the Sessions Court, Thrissur. The following two\nconditions were imposed in the said order:\n\n2. One of the sureties shall be a nearest relative of the\naccused and the above fact shall be certified by the village Officer\nconcerned.\n\n3. Both sureties shall produce their original documents to\nsubstantiate their solvency along with a self attested copy of the said\ndocument.\n\n2. The insistence on one of the sureties being a nearest relative\nand that both sureties shall produce the original documents to\nsubstantiate their solvency, is according to the petitioner impossible of\nperformance, since he has no near relative in Kerala who is solvent and\nfurther that the available sureties are not willing to produce their original\ndocuments fearing coercive action against them. Petitioner’s parents\nhad migrated from outside Kerala and have allegedly not acquired any\n\n2024/KER/4678\nCRL.MC NO. 481 OF 2024\n3\nproperty till date. Therefore, the sureties are not able to produce\nsolvency certificate also. It was however submitted that petitioner is\nwilling to produce other sureties who are ready to ensure the presence\nof the accused during trial.\n\n3. The condition of one of the sureties being a parent or near\nrelative who is solvent with landed property owned by him can be in\ncertain circumstances, an onerous condition, especially when the\naccused belongs to another State. Such onerous conditions rendering an\norder granting bail practically illusory ought not to be imposed.\nReference to the decision in Moti Ram and others v. State of\nMadhya Pradesh [1978 (4) SCC 47] is relevant in this regard.\n\n4, The requirement to produce original documents to\nsubstantiate solvency, is also, according to me, beyond the scope of\nconditions that should be imposed while granting bail. Though the\nconditions provide that original documents can be returned after\nverification, still, such a condition can instill fear in the mind of the\nsureties. The requirement is only that the sureties ought to be solvent.\nCondition that the original document must be produced, can, in fact,\nrender the order practically incapable of performance, since many a\ntimes the sureties may have mortgaged the property or may be afraid\nto produce the original title deeds before the court of law. Such a\ncondition has in the present case rendered the order granting bail\nredundant. In the peculiar circumstances of the present case, especially\n\na\n2024/KER/4678\nCRL.MC NO. 481 OF 2024\n4\n\nsince the petitioner is from outside the State the conditions insisting on\na parent or nearest relative having landed property and to produce the\noriginal document are required to be modified.\n\n5. Therefore, | set aside Condition No.2 and 3. inx\nCrI.M.C.1830/2023 on the files of the Sessions Court, Thrissur.\n\nThis Crl.M.C. is disposed of as above.\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\n\njm/\n\na\n2024/KER/4678\nCRL.MC NO. 481 OF 2024\n5\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 481/2024\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES\nAnnexure Atl A TRUE COPY OF THE FIR REGISTERED BY\nERUMAPPETTY POLICE STATION AS PER CRIME NO.\n610/2023 DATED 16.09.2023\nAnnexure A2 A TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER OF THE HON'BLE\nDISTRICT AND SESSIONS COURT, THRISSUR IN\nCRL.MC NO.1830/2023 DATED 26.12.2023\n\n"
