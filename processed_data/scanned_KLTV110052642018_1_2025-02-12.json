Hence considering the nature of the accusation, gravity of\noffence, circumstances which leads to the commission of offence, age of the\noffendor, family background of the offendor, I am of the opinion that the\naccused shall not be sentence to maximum punishment. But adequate\npunishment must be given to compensate the nature of offence committed by\nthe accused.\n\n8. In the result, the accused is convicted u/s. 253 (2) of Cr.PC and sentenced to\n\n4\n\nfine of Rs. 10,000/- for the offence u/s. 20(b) (ii) A of NDPS and in default of\npayment of fine undergo simple imprisonment for three months and sentenced\nto fine of Rs. 10,000/- for the offence under Section 22 (a) of NDPS Act and\nin default of payment of fine he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three\nmonths.
