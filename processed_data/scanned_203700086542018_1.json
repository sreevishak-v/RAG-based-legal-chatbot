CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n07.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nCrl.MC.No.8654/2018 2019/KERIO89\n-: 26\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner herein is the 2\" accused in\nC.C.48/2011 of the Special Court (SPE/CBI),\nThiruvananthapuram, which is a prosecution brought\nby the CBI. After the examination of the\nprosecution witnesses, the accused were called upon\nto enter on defence. As required under Section 243\nCr.P.C., the petitioner submitted a list of\nwitnesses, and requested the court to summon those\nwitnesses. The list submitted by him contains four\nwitnesses, and the list also explains the purpose\nfor which each witness is sought to be examined. Of\nthe four witnesses cited by the petitioner, two are\nserving or retired bank officials, and the 4\nwitness is a Chartered Accountant. The application\nfiled by him as Crl.M.P.180/2018 was opposed by the\nCBI on the ground that examination of those\nwitnesses unnecessarily would only delay the\nprocess, and defeat the ends of justice.\n\nCrl.MC.No.8654/2018 2019/KER/689\n-: Bre\n\n2. After hearing both sides, the learned trial\nJudge allowed examination of three of the defence\nwitnesses, but disallowed the request for\nexamination of the 4° witness as defence witness.\nAggrieved by that part of the order dated\n13.12.2018, disallowing examination of the Ath\ndefence witness, the 2\" accused has come up before\nthis Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C.\n\n3. On hearing both sides, and on a perusal of\nthe impugned order, and also the list of witnesses\nsubmitted by the petitioner before the trial court,\nI find that the object for which the 4 witness is\nsought to be examined can be achieved even\notherwise, and that the request was rightly\ndisallowed by the trial court. The 4 witness cited\nby the petitioner is a Chartered Accountant, and the\npurpose of his examination as a defence witness is\nto explain the banking procedure, including the\nprocedure for sanctioning different types of loans.\nThis procedure is covered by the circulars and\n\nCrl.MC.No.8654/2018 2019/KER/689\n-: Are\n\ninstructions issued by the bank authorities, and the\nReserve Bank of India. The prosecution has already\nexamined some bank officials. No doubt, the\npetitioner and the other accused must have\nthoroughly cross examined those witnesses on all\nissues, including the banking procedure, and also\nthe procedure for sanctioning different types of\nloans. Any way, two more witnesses are being\nexamined on the defence side also as bank officials.\nTf at all the petitioner wants to bring out any\nclarification as regards banking procedure, that can\nbe brought out through the examination of the\nwitnesses 1 and 2 cited by him, and of course, he\nmust have brought out the required materials through\nthe cross examination of the prosecution witnesses\nalso.\n\n4. A Chartered Accountant is not expected to\nexplain the banking procedure. He cannot be said to\nbe an expert on the field. He can, of course,\ncompetently say about auditing and accounting.\n\nCrl.MC.No.8654/2018 2019/KER/689\n-: 5 re\nBanking procedure, or the procedural formalities\nregarding different banking transactions will have\nto be explained by the competent persons, including\nbank officials. Such things cannot be brought out\nthrough a Chartered Accountant. That is why, the\ntrial court disallowed the request to examine a\nchartered accountant for explaining banking\nprocedure. I find that it was rightly done by the\ntrial court. Any way, if at all the petitioner\nwants to bring out some clarification on the\nrelevant issues or aspects as regards banking\nprocedure or the sanctioning of loans, he can very\nwell bring it through the defence witnesses cited by\nhim. If at all he has omitted to put the necessary\nquestions to the prosecution witnesses on the point,\nthose witnesses can very well be recalled, if felt\nor found absolutely necessary. This cannot be done\nas of right. If such a request comes before the\ntrial court, the depositions given by the bank\nofficials on the side of the prosecution will have\n\nCrl.MC.No.8654/2018 2019/KER/689\n-: Gre\nto be examined carefully and thoroughly by the trial\ncourt, and see whether those aspects sought to be\nclarified are already covered by the depositions\ngiven by the witnesses in cross examination. Tf\nthose aspects are not already covered by the\ndeposition given by the prosecution witnesses, and\nif the defence witnesses 1 and 2 are not able to\nexplain such procedure with competence, the trial\ncourt can think of allowing the request to recall\nthe prosecution witnesses under Section 311 Cr.P.C.\nWith these observations, this Crl.M.c. is\ndisposed of.\nSd/-\n\nP.UBAID\n\nJUDGE\nJvt/7.1.2019\n\nBle el\nire Bees a\nee\n\nCr1.MC.No.8654/2018 201/KERI689\n\n-: 7Joi-\nAPPENDIX\n\nPETITIONER'S ANNEXURES :\n\nANNEXURE I ‘THE CERTIFIED COPY OF THE COURT CHARGE IN CC\n48/2011 OF SPECIAL COURT (SPE/CBI),\nTHTRUVANANTHAPURAM.\n\nANNEXURE II CERTIFIED COPY OF THE WITNESS SCHEDULE FILED BY\nTHE PETITIONER/2ND ACCUSED IN CC 48/2011.\n\nANNEXURE III CERTIFIED COPY OF THE COUNTER FILED BY THE\nPROSECUTION TO ANNEXURE - II WITNESS SCHEDULE.\n\nANNEXURE IV CERTIFIED COPY OF THE ORDER DATED 13.12.2018 IN\nCRL.M.P.180/2018 IN CC 48/2011 (CRIME NO.
