This case has arisen on a final report filed by the Sub Inspector of Police,\nThampanoor Police station in crime No. 346/10 alleging the commission of\nan offences against the accused under Sections 323, 332 r/w 34 of the Indian\nPenal Code.\n\n2. The prosecution case, in brief, is as follows:- On 05.05.2010 at 09.30 am\nthe accused nos. 1 and 2 in furtherance of common intention to cause\nvoluntarily hurt to the informant who was working as the receptionist in\nThycaud Govt. hospital , accused nos. 1 and 2 attacked the informant by\nwrongfully restrain him.

When 2™\nand 3™ witness in the final report tried to prevent it, they were brutally\nmanhandled by 2™ accused in this case and the 3\" accused also participated in\nthe commission of offence. Thus the accused nos. 1 and 2 alleged to have\ncommitted the offences under Sections 323, 332 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal\nCode.\n\n3. On the issuance of summons, the accused no. 1 and 2 appeared before the\ncourt. The accused were furnished with copies of prosecution records and\n\nthereby complied with the mandate under section 207 of the Criminal\nProcedure Code. Thereafter, the accused were heard on the charge levelled\nagainst him. The charge was framed under Section 323, 332 r/w 34 of the In-\ndian Penal Code, read over and explained to them to which they pleaded not\nguilty and claimed to be tried.\n\n4. From the side of the prosecution, the prosecution examined seven witnesses as\nPW1 to PW7 and marked eight documents as Exts. P1 to P8, P8(a),P8(b) and\nP8(c).No defence evidence was adduced from the side of the defence.\n\n5. On the completion of prosecution evidence, the accused no. 1 and 2 were\nquestioned under Section 313 (1) (b) of the Criminal Procedure Code, in which\nthey denied all the incriminating circumstances appearing in prosecution\nevidence against them.\n\n6. Heard the learned Assistant Public Prosecutor and the learned counsel for the\naccused.\n\n7. The points that arise for consideration are as follows:-\n\n1: Did the accused on 05.05.2010 at 09.30 am the accused nos. 1 and 2\nin furtherance of common intention attack and to cause voluntarily\nhurt to the informant who was working as the receptionist in Thy-\ncaud Govt. hospital and thus alleged to have committed under Section\n323 read with 34 of the Indian Penal Code?\n\n2. Did the accused on 05.05.2010 at 09.30 am the accused nos. 1 and 2\nin furtherance of common intention attack and prevent witness nos. 1\nto 3 in the final report from discharging his official duty and thus al-\nleged to have committed under Section 332 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal\nCode?\n\n3 Ifthe accused are found guilty, what is the order as to sentence?\n\n8. Point No.1 and 2 :- In this case, PW4 deposed before the court that on\n05.05.2010 while he had been working as Sub Inspector of Thampanoor\npolice station he got knowledge regarding the commission of offence from\n\nwitness no. 1 in the final report. ‘Based on that information had registered\ncrime against accused nos. 1 and 2 vide Thampanoor police station crime\n346/2010 w/s. 323, 332 read with 34 of the Indian Penal Code. During the\ncourse of investigation he had identified 1% and 2\" accused and continued\nwith the investigation. After completing the investigation PW4 filed final re-\nport in this case.\n\n9. PW6 deposed before the court that on 05.05.2010 while he had been working\nas casualty medical officer, he had examined witness no. 1 in the final report\nand prepared Ext P7 medical certificate.\n\n10. PW7 deposed before the court that he went to Thycaud Govt. Hospital as per\nthe direction of witness no. 9 in the final report and prepared the body note by\nverifying the body of witness no. 5 in the final report.\n\n11.1 have analysed the evidence of PW4, PW6 and PW7 In this case, from the\nside of prosecution PW1 to 7 were examined. But PW1,PW2,PW3 and PW5\nwere turned hostile to the prosecution. Even though the witnesses were turned\nhostile to the prosecution learned Assistant Public Prosecutor continued to\nproceed with the examination of remaining witnesses on the ground that it is\nan offence affecting the interest of public at large and if the remaining\nwitnesses were given up by the prosecution it would adversely affect the\nprosecution and administration of justice in this case. Hence the learned\nAssistant Public Prosecutor continued with the proceed with the case.\n\n12. It is pertinent to note that there is no delay in lodging the FIR. I have analysed\nthe evidence of PW1 he had deposed about the incident but could not identi-\nfied the accused. The same deposition was given by other injured who were\nexamined as PW2 and PW3. In this case, the offences alleged against the ac-\ncused is u/s. 323 and 332 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code. On analysing the\nevidence of Ext P5 wound certificate PW6 noticed about the injuries are small\nabrasion and contusion and dislocation of left lower second premolar tooth.\nBut PW6 deposed the injuries before this court but the prosecution has not\nbrought out from the evidence of PW6 about the opinion as to the cause of\ninjury. So the medical evidence is not supporting the prosecution case to the\n\nextent that does not conoborate with the evidence of other prosecution\nwitnesses regarding the opinion as to the cause of injury.\n\n13. In order to constitute an offence u/s. 332 and 323 of Indian Penal Code it\nmust be proved by the prosecution that the witnesses who are the public ser-\nvants performed their duty and they were injured by discharging their official\nduty. 2°’ thing is that the act must be done with the intend to prevent the pub-\nlic servants from discharging their official duties. In this case, nothing has\nbeen revealed from the prosecution case regarding whether in voluntarily hurt\nwas caused to witness no. 1 to3 in the final report which prevent them from\ndischarging their official duty at the time of incident. Moreover, the prosecu-\ntion has failed to produce relevant records showing that witness no. 1 to 3 in\nthe final report are public servants of Govt. Hospital, Thycaud and they were\nperformed duty at the time of alleged incident. Hence prosecution has failed\nto prove beyond reasonable doubt that accused nos. 1 and 2 on 05.05.2010 at\n09.30 am went to Thycaud hospital, Thiruvananthapuram and attacked wit-\nness no. 1 to 3 in the final report and voluntarily caused hurt to them and pre-\nvent them from discharging their official duty. Hence, point nos. 1 and 2 are\nfound against the prosecution.\n\n10. Point No. 3:- In view of my findings on Point No.1 and 2, it is found that the\naccused no. 1 and 2 are found not guilty of the offences punishable under\nSections 323, 332 1/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code.\n\n11. In the result, the accused no. 1 and 2 are found not guilty and acquitted under\nSection 248(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for the offence under\nSections 323, 332 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code. The bail bonds of the\naccused stand cancelled and they are set at liberty.
