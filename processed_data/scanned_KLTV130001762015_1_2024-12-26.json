The learned counsels for the accused no .1 to 3 submitted that PW1 herself\nadmitted that she and her husband Binu, PW2 were aware of the liability that\nexists over the property ,further the possession of the property was delivered\non the next day as per the agreement and PW1 and PW2 were started to live in\nthe said house and they are still living there .It was also submitted that the\nnotice calling the accused no.1 to perform the agreement for sale was sent by\nPW1 after one and half year ,and the accused no.1 had sent the notice first time\ncalling PW1 to perform her part,in fact in pursuance of the said agreement the\nfirst accused had delivered the possession of the building which was also\nadmitted by PW1 and PW2 .With regard to the elements of cheating ,the\nlearned counsel submitted that ,the prosecution has miserably failed to prove\nthat the accused persons have the intention to cheat PW1 .Furthermore the role\nof accused no2 and 3 is not categorically stated and allegations made against\nthem are not proved .Thus the accused persons entitled to be acquitted .\n\n25. Evaluation of the evidence : PW1 and PW2 are husband and wife . The\nprosecution case is that the accused no 1 to 3 in furtherance of their common\nintention ,after conspiracy entered into an agreement for sale with PW1\nDhanya and obtained Rs .4 lakh from her . PW1 ,PW2 and PW4 were material\nwitnesses .They were examined by the prosecution to prove the transaction\nbetween the accused nol and PW1 .The existence of the agreement dated\n29.3.2012 for the sale of Greeshmam House belongs to the accused no.1 is not\n\nJudgment in CC. 123/2015\n\n13 of 26\ndisputed by accused persons ,in fact the existence of agreement is admitted by\nthe defence . Now let's examine whether the prosecution has proved the\noffence of cheating and criminal conspiracy .PW1 admitted that she and her\nfamily reside in the Greeshmam house ,which was handed over to her by the\naccused no.1 soon after the execution of the agreement for sale . In order to\nattract the offence of cheating the following elements are to be proved :\n(i) the deception of any person,\n(ii) fraudulently or dishonestly inducing that person to deliver any property to\nany person,\nand (iii) mens rea or dishonest intention of the accused at the time of making\nthe inducement.\n\n26. The prosecution case is that the accused persons concealed the liabilities over\nthe said property and induced PW1 to enter into the agreement .PW1 Dhanya\nin the examination in chief admitted that she had verified the title deed as well\nas the prior deed of the said property and the possession of the said property\nwas delivered to her on 30.3.2012 as agreed by them after clearing the\nmortgage .According to her she had verified the encumbrance certificate before\nentering in to the agreement .In the examination in chief she stated that ‘s] amg\nMNAHSlOLIQo MODSO AHH GOS2] MIGLOOAMDc AITY aMssBBOS Gases\nADLOD] MOGMOAM GHAULWJOejS1Go GRAIG Goorlad Moqooowley Where as in\n\nJudgment in CC. 123/2015\n\n14 of 26\n\nthe cross examination she deposed that ‘006 @J&0@o0 BIaAIW1EaBS1@ amy\n6008 ag) YO] af|/G@Bo aHMM aANwlmamleneny EJOl&w aNgomMg@ agmny\nAONGDMIGS VOOIMIAM .O098 MILIIAIW1H3BH1G3 610908 aay OD PO] aMgaolejomo\nalNGIMIG3 Weelwoem.’ According to PW1 ,she never had any direct contact\nwith the accused persons in fact her husband i.e, PW2 had communicated with\nthe accused persons .She admitted in the cross examination that the agreement\ndated 7.10.2011 was entered in to between PW2 and Accused no.1 and given 4\nlakh rupees as advance ,though she denied the existence of such an agreement\nfirst and stated that \"@@s\\o@m 096 @J&000 2 AIAMo Gol BM EJ@1ER3\n\nMAING aM0ad SBOMOIANM MBAIOIGMD ag an” AOGDDHIGS VoClMI6M” .OENE ClaMo\nGal OLIGOHOMEqJW SGOMIANEMIS’ S1 DA MENWOEaWo agwMlaadadgiae\nAIJo 6008 Oloamlolesan’. The copy of the Ext. P2 agreement which was\nproduced by the prosecution was marked subject to proof since ,the original\nagreement according to PW1 produced before the Honourable Sub Court,\nThiruvananthapuram in OS No. 1280/2011 and later the certified copy of the\nsaid agreement was produced . Hence Ext. P2 is proved. As per the terms of\nsaid agreement accused no.1 agreed to execute the sale deed after clearing the\nmortgage and other liabilities that exists over the said property .During cross\nexamination of PW1 she also admitted that she was aware of the liabilities over\nthe property ,when she was asked about her knowledge about the liabilities she\n\nJudgment in CC. 123/2015\n\n15 of 26\n\ncategorically stated that “aryaNes mows genzeoMl@moagay emnInWsoo43’,\nExt.

Di through her. The receipt, acknowledged the receipt of key\nof the Greesmam House by PW1.\n\n27.PW2 Binu denied the agreement dated 7.10.2011 ,according to him there is\nonly one agreement that is the Ext P2 ,and he had seen the original title deed of\nthe said property . When he was asked about the advocate notices issued by his\ncounsel, he gave a negative answer , ‘moelaiWwles” Guatio aad BdN0\nBleue’ asl asses emoglaw’ Go@ajl@a\" agmy” aloanmM@s Geoilam ag)\ngodlolete: ’ . Regarding the notice sent to the advocate of the accused no.1\nalso he gave such an answer .When he was asked about the notices issued by\nhim and PW1 through their cousel calling the accused to perform their part ,he\nreplied that ‘@@06 @08100IWIeM” EUIAUAIEM” PHAUIV\\OA|GSOOM aloswMoes\nvo@leoerm”. The Ext P2 agreement was dated 29.3.2012 ,as per the agreement\nthe sale deed has to be executed with in 3 months from the date of execution of\nExt P2,whereas the notice was sent by the PW1 through her counsel on\n30.12.2013 calling them to perform their part ,the said original notice was\n\nJudgment in CC. 123/2015\n\n16 of 26\nproduced by the accused no.1 and marked as Ext D5 (a) the copy of reply\nnotice sent by the accused no.1 through her counsel was marked as Ext D6\nsubject to proof .The accused no.1 had produced the copy of advocate notice\nissued by her counsel dated 30.8.2013 was produced and marked as Ext D4\nsubject to proof ,the original reply sent by advocate under the instructions of\nPW2 Binu was marked as Ext D5.The Ext D5 (a) original notices shows that\nPW1 called the accused no.1 to perform her part after one and half years ,i.e,\nafter the accused no.1 issued notice to her . Though PW2 denied the notice\nissued by his counsel under his instruction ,the original notices itself speak the\nreadiness and willingness of accused no.1 to perform her part. The transaction\nis unchallenged by the defence ,the defence admits the transaction ,which was\nwitnessed by PW4 Kumar . He was examined by the prosecution to prove the\ntransactions, which is unchallenged. His version is that after the execution of\nagreement for sale PW1 and PW2 were verified the encumbrance\ncertificate .PW3 Anilkumar who is not conversant with the transaction that had\ntaken place between PW1 and the accused no.1 claims that after the execution\nof Ext D2 agreement for sale ,the original title deed is with him .Whereas\nPW1 and PW2 deposed that they had verified the original title deed and its\nprior deed at the time of executing Ext P2 .However PW2 stated that the title\ndeed was not shown by PW3 Anilkumar, ‘@emica:n08 agan” aloMan @gQB26M\"\n(QJAIEMo HIM 1a] OAMAMAD aloswmMoes vo@lwer, moreover PW3 admitted that\nJudgment in CC. 123/2015\n\n17 of 26\n\nhe was committed default in performing the Ext D2 agreement for sale that\nwas entered into between him and accused no.1 and thereafter he had never\napproached the accused nol to execute the sale deed .The evidence of PW1\nand PW2 is contradictory as to the part showing their readiness and\nwillingness to perform the contract. Though prosecution alleges that the\naccused no.1 concealed the liabilities from PW1 ,PW1 herself admits her\nknowledge about the liabilities in her cross examination.\n\n28.The next thing that has to be considered is the role of accused no.2 and 3 .\nOnly the accused nol and Pw1 were the parties to Ext P2 agreement .The\nprosecution allegation is that the accused no.1 to 3 were conspiring to cheat\nPW1 .The following elements have to be proved by the prosecution in order to\nattract the offence w/s.120 B:\n1) Agreement: There must be an agreement between two or more persons.\n2) Illegal Act: The agreement must be for committing an illegal act or an act by\nillegal means.\n3) Intent to Commit an Offense: The agreement must be specifically to commit\nan offense as defined under the IPC.\nGoing by the facts and evidence of the case ,there is no evidence to prove that\nthe accused no.1 to 3 were involved in a criminal conspiracy .\n\nJudgment in CC. 123/2015\n\n18 of 26\n\n29.The next is whether the evidence adduced by the prosecution is sufficient to\nprove the offence u/s.420 of the Indian Penal Code or not ? The allegation is\nthat by concealing the liability, Ext P2 agreement was executed and later\ncommitted default in executing the sale deed .There was civil dispute between\nparties before the honourable sub court ,Thiruvananthapuram for specific\nperformance of contract as OS 51/2015.Now the question is whether non\nperformance of contract for sale of an immovable property would attract the\noffence w/s.420 of IPC has to be examined . S.420, IPC provides that:\n\"Whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly induces the person deceived to\ndeliver any property to any person, or to make, alter or destroy the whole or\nany part of a valuable security, or anything which is signed or sealed, and\nwhich is capable of being converted into a valuable security, shall be punished\nwith imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven\nyears, and shall also be liable to fine.\"\nFor an offence under S.420, IPC, the following ingredients must be present: i.\nCheating as defined under $.415, IPC, that is, there should be a fraudulent or\ndishonest inducement of a person;\nii. An intention to deceive; and\niii. The person cheated must be dishonestly induced to\na. Deliver property to any person; or\nb. Make, alter or destroy valuable security or anything signed or sealed and\ncapable of being converted into valuable security.\n\nJudgment in CC. 123/2015\n\n19 of 26\n30.In SureshKumar K v. Venugopalan P 2024 KLT (1)186 it was observed by\nthe honorable apex court that “The ingredient which would constitute 'cheating'\nas defined under S.415 IPC is an inseparable part of offence punishable under\n5.420 IPC. Hence, when there is delivery of any property either movable or\nimmovable or money in trust for the performance of contractual obligation\narising out of a contract for sale, unless there is \"inducement\" to deliver such\nproperty or to enter into a contract, it would not attract the criminal liability\nunder the said provision even if it is found that the contract was entered into\nand the other person had entertained a dishonest intention at that time. There\nshould be something to show that the other person was compelled or persuaded\nto enter into such contract and deliver any money or property. If the existence\nof dishonest intention is of such a nature sufficient to persuade the other\ndirectly or indirectly to enter into a contract or to deliver property, it would fall\nunder the mischief of \"inducement\". When the contract contains a specific\nclause that the seller should clear out all existing liabilities over the property\nwhich is the subject of the contract within the period of contract or within a\nspecified time, it would constitute a contractual obligation on that party to\nperform it within the time agreed into. Necessarily, the existence of liability\nover the property at the time when the contract was entered will stand subject\nto the above said contractual obligation to be performed on a future date,\nhence, non - disclosure of any such liability at the time when the contract was\nJudgment in CC. 123/2015\n\n20 of 26\nentered into cannot be brought under the purview of \"cheating\" as defined\nunder S.415 IPC, even if it involves payment of money or delivery of\npossession of property. A mere obligation though involves monetary transfer by\nway of advance or earnest money cannot be brought under the purview of\n\"delivery of property under deception\", unless involves \"inducement\" for the\npurpose of attracting either of the offences viz., $.418 and S.420 IPC. The\nprimary requirement to make out an offence of \"cheating\", the inseparable part\nof both the offences under S.418 and S.420 IPC is the existence of dishonest or\nfraudulent \"inducement\". The existence of fraudulent or dishonest intention\nmay not be sufficient, unless it carries the necessary vital ingredient persuading\nthe other or compelling the other directly or indirectly to enter into the\nagreement or to deliver such property. Hence, a mere non - disclosure of a\nliability over the property unless coupled with the necessary intention of\ndeception and inducement cannot be brought under the purview of criminal\nliability under $.418 and S.420 IPC. But the legal position would be different\nwhen there is assertion in the contract with respect to non - existence of any\nliability or a declaration to that effect, which would by its nature constitute the\nrequired \"inducement\" with the dishonest intention. In short, mere non -\ndisclosure of any liability over the property at the time when the contract was\nentered into for the sale of property with the specific understanding that all\nliabilities will be cleared before the execution of the sale deed would not attract\nthe criminal liability either under $.418 or S.420 IPC, unless there is an\nJudgment in CC. 123/2015\n\n21 of 26\nassertion / declaration to the contrary in the contract. Subsequent failure to\ncomply with the condition agreed into would fall within the mischief of breach\nof an obligation arising out of contract, for which no criminal liability can be\nfastened either under S.418 or $.420 IPC’.\n\n31.In Radheyshyam v. State of Rajasthan (2024 KHC 6449), the same question\nwas discussed by the honourable apex court and observed that “ Mere non -\nperformance of an Agreement to Sell by itself does not amount to cheating and\nbreach of trust. Respondent no.2 has adequate remedy of filing a Civil Suit for\nrelief of specific performance of a contract which he has already availed and\nthe suit is still pending. The FIR only appears to be an arm - twisting\nmechanism to pressurise the appellants to execute the Sale Deed or to extract\nmoney. Every civil wrong cannot be converted into a criminal wrong. As we\nfind in the present case, respondent no.2 is trying to abuse the criminal\nmachinery for ulterior motives’.\n\n32. Going by the facts of the case it is clear that as agreed in Ext P2 the possession\nof the said property was delivered to PW1 and first part of Ext P2 was\nperformed .Then the next question is who failed to execute the sale deed ,jhow\never the proof of readiness and willingness as well as the proof that who failed\nto perform the contract ,all are purely in civil nature ,though it is so,in order to\ndecide the said question arose in the present case that whether the accused\n\nJudgment in CC. 123/2015\n\n22 of 26\nno.1 duped PW1 or not,the elements of cheating must be proved by the\nprosecution .The Ext D5 (a)notice sent by PW1 through her counsel after one\nand half months from the date of Ext P2,before that on September, 2013 Ext.\nD5 reply notice was sent by PW1 to the notice already sent to her by the\naccused no.1 .Prosecution has neither produced any notices as issued by PW1\ncalling the accused no.1 to perform the contract nor has the case that such a\nnotice has sent before Ext D5(a) . PW5 and PW7 deposes that the property had\nliability to the bank ,the evidence of PW1 and PW2 is insufficient to hold that\nthey had no knowledge about the liability over the property .Further the case of\nPW1 was that she and PW2 came to know about the liability from a\nnewspaper advertisement, which is not produced by the prosecution. When the\nfacts of the case is analysed in the light of judgments of Honourable Apex\nCourt cited above, it can be seen that there is specific recital in the Ext.P2\nagreement that the property has liability, the wordings that “ag] miowsmaBo\nAQ ENIOW$OBo eof\", there is nothing contrary to that, it is not stated in the\nagreement that the property is free from any liability. Hence it cannot be said\nthat the accused persons were concealed the liability over the property.\nAnother aspect in the prosecution has to prove the malafide intention of the\naccused no.1 at the time of entering into Ext. P2 agreement, ie, her dishonest\nintention to cheat PW1, there is recital in the agreement as to the liability over\nthe property as well as PW1 also submits that the possession was delivered to\nJudgment in CC. 123/2015\n\n23 of 26\n\nthem with the intention to execute the deed. On analysing all these things ,it\ncannot be said that the accused persons have the criminal intention to cheat\nPW1 at the time of entering into the agreement were committed the offence of\ncheating u/s.420 of the Indian Penal Code1860.\nRegarding the offence u/s.406 Of IPC the following elements must be proved :\ni. The accused was entrusted with property, or entrusted with dominion over\nproperty;\nii. The accused had dishonestly misappropriated or converted to their own use\nthat property, or dishonestly used or disposed of that property or wilfully suffer\nany other person to do so; and\niii. Such misappropriation, conversion, use or disposal should be in violation of\nany direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be\ndischarged, or of any legal contract which the person has made, touching the\ndischarge of such trust.\n\n33.Coming to the facts of the present case PW1 had given Rs.4 lakh as advance as\npart of Ext P2 agreement, which is purely a civil transaction ,apart from that\nthere is no entrustment of any property to the accused no.1 to 3 .Since there is\nno entrustment of property it cannot be said that the accused persons were\ncommitted the offence u/s.406 of IPC . For said reasons these point nos. 1 to 3\nare found against the prosecution.\n\nJudgment in CC. 123/2015\n\n24 of 26\n34, Point No.4 :- Upon the finding in point Nos. 1 to 3, accused Nos. 1 to 3 are\nfound not guilty of offences punishable under sections 420, 406 and 120B read\nwith 34 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 and they are acquitted of the said offences\nunder section 248(1) Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.
