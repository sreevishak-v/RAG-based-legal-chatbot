No.2619 of 2015\nDated this the 28\" day of April 2015\nORDER\n\nPetitioners are accused Nos.1 to 3 in Crime No.1151 of 2011\nof Taliparamba Police Station for the offences punishable under\nSections 341, 323 and 324 r/w 34 of Indian Penal Code, based on\na private complaint filed by the second respondent, which is\npending as C.C.No.743 of 2012 on the file of Judicial First Class\nMagistrate Court, Taliparamba.

Heard, the learned counsel for petitioners, learned\nPublic Prosecutor appearing for the first respondent and the\nlearned counsel appearing for the second and third respondents.\n\n2015/KER/17458\nCrl.M.C. No.2619 of 2015\n“2s\n\n3. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab (2012 (10) SCC\n303), the Apex Court held that, the power of the High Court in\nquashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of\nits inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power\ngiven to a Criminal Court for compounding the offences under\nSection 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Inherent power is\nof wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be\nexercised in accordance with the guidelines engrafted in such\npower viz.; (i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse\nof the process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the\ncriminal proceeding or complaint or FIR may be exercised where\nthe offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend\non the facts and circumstances of each case and no category can\nbe prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High\nCourt must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the\ncrime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or\noffences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly\nquashed even though the victim or victim's family and the\noffender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not private in\nnature and have serious impact on society. Similarly, any\ncompromise between the victim and offender in relation to the\n\n2015/KER/17458\nCrl.M.C. No.2619 of 2015\n“3+\n\noffences under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act\nor the offences committed by public servants while working in\nthat capacity etc.; cannot provide for any basis for quashing\ncriminal proceedings involving such offences. But criminal cases\nhaving overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour stand on\na different footing for the purpose of quashing, particularly\noffences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil\npartnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out of\nmatrimonial relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where\nthe wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the\nparties have resolved their entire dispute. In these categories of\ncases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings, if in its view,\nbecause of the compromise between the offender and the victim,\nthe possibility of a conviction is remote and bleak and\ncontinuation of criminal case would put accused to great\noppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused\nto him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and\ncomplete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other\nwords, the High Court may consider whether it would be unfair or\ncontrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal\nproceedings or continuation of criminal proceedings would\n\n2015/KER/17458\nCrl.M.C. No.2619 of 2015\n“4s\n\ntantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and\ncompromise between the victim and wrong-doer and whether to\nsecure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is\n\nput to an end and if the answer to the above question is in\naffirmative the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to\nquash the criminal proceedings.\n\n4. The allegation against the petitioners is that they have\ncommitted the offences punishable under Sections 341, 323 and\n324 r/w 34 of Indian Penal Code.\n\n5. Now as submitted by both sides, the entire dispute\nbetween the petitioners and the second and third respondents has\nalready been settled amicably and the learned counsel for the\nsecond and third respondents has also stated that they do not\nwant to prosecute the criminal case filed against the petitioners.\nThe second and third respondents have also filed affidavits before\nthis Court in this regard.\n\n6. In such circumstances, this is a fit case in which the\nproceedings pending against the petitioners in C.C.No.743 of\n2012 on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,\nTaliparamba can be quashed by this Court invoking the powers\nunder Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in the light\n\n2015/KER/17458\nCrl.M.C. No.2619 of 2015\n5\nof the principles laid down by the Apex Court in Gian Sing's\ncase (supra).\n\nIn the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and the entire\nproceedings as against the petitioners in Crime No.1151 of 2011\nof Taliparamba Police Station, which is pending as C.C.No.743 of\n2012 on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,\nTaliparamba are quashed.\n\nSd/-\nANIL K.
