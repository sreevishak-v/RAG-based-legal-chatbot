The prosecution case, in brief, is that the de facto\ncomplainant is presently residing in Saudi Arabia where he is\nworking with a company named M/s.Manah_ Trading\n\nip\n2021/KER/168\nCr. MC 8865/2019\n3\nEstablishment. The complainant has filed copies of his\npassport, visa and resident card issued by the Government of\nSaudi Arabia. The accused is alleged to be the Managing\nPartner of the above-mentioned Establishment. The business\ncard of the accused is produced to prove that fact. He is\npresently in India. The complainant was approached by the\naccused, a close relative, during May 2011 offering him a job\nin the aforesaid Establishment. Relying on the assurances\ngiven by the accused, the complainant accepted the job offer\nand joined for duty immediately. About 3 months prior to the\nfiling of the complaint, the complainant made a request to the\naccused to allow him to return to India on availing his statutory\nleave/vacation. The accused demanded 2% 6 lakh for permitting\n\nip\n2021/KER/168\nCrl.MC 8865/2019\n4\nthe complainant to go on leave and for releasing his passport\nfor that purpose. He was threatened with a criminal charge in\ncase he did not pay the amount. During the entire tenure of\nemployment, the complainant was able to visit his native place\nonly thrice, the last visit being in March, 2018 for about a\nfortnight. It is illegal on the part of the accused to have had\nretained the passport of the complainant. That apart, the\ncomplainant was also made to affix his thumb impression ona\ndocument written in Arabic, the contents of which is not\nknown to him. The accused has since returned to India with\nthe passport of the complainant, rendering him homeless and\nstranded in Saudi Arabia without any salary or accommodation.\nThe complainant, therefore, alleges that the accused has\n\nip\n\n2021/KER/168\n\nCrl.MC 8865/2019\n5\n\ncommitted an offence of criminal breach of trust by not\nreturning the passport of the complainant and for dishonestly\nmisappropriating it. By dishonestly inducing the complainant\nto deliver his passport to the accused, he has cheated the\ncomplainant committing offences punishable under Sections\n406 and 420 of the I.P.C.\n\n3. The learned Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-1\nrecorded statements of the complainant's wife and witnesses\nand was satisfied that the ingredients essential for offences\npunishable under Sections 406 and 420 I.P.C are made out and\naccordingly, directed issuance of summons to the accused.\n\n4. Aggrieved by the action of the Magistrate in issuing\nsummons to the accused, he has approached this Court\n\nip\n2021/KER/168\nCrl.MC 8865/2019\n6\nseeking to quash the proceedings under Section 482 Cr.P.C\nmainly on the ground that no prima facie case has been made\nout to attract an offence punishable under Sections 406 and\n420 of the I.P.C. It is further contended that the Court at\nOttapalam has no territorial jurisdiction to entertain the\ncomplaint as the complainant is residing in Saudi Arabia and\nthe alleged offence was committed in that country. According\nto the laws existing in Saudi Arabia, an employee cannot leave\nthe country without the sanction of his sponsor who is a\ncitizen of Saudi Arabia. Even the witness examined as CW3\nbefore the Magistrate has deposed that the consent of the\nsponsor is essential to come home. That apart, the complaint\nis filed without seeking prior sanction from the Central\n\nip\n2021/KER/168\nCr. MC 8865/2019\n7\nGovernment for filing a complaint in India for offences\nallegedly committed outside the country, as contemplated\nunder Section 188 of the Cr.P.C. The allegation made in the\ncomplaint about the accused with holding or misappropriating\nthe passport of the complainant is untrue. Even the wife of the\ncomplainant who has filed the complaint and was examined\nbefore the Magistrate as CW-1, has testified that she is not\nsure whether the passport of the complainant is with the\naccused. Hence it is prayed that the entire proceedings in CC\nNo.746/2019 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's\nCourt-1 may be quashed",

The allegation made in the\ncomplaint about the accused with holding or misappropriating\nthe passport of the complainant is untrue. Even the wife of the\ncomplainant who has filed the complaint and was examined\nbefore the Magistrate as CW-1, has testified that she is not\nsure whether the passport of the complainant is with the\naccused. Hence it is prayed that the entire proceedings in CC\nNo.746/2019 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's\nCourt-1 may be quashed under the provisions of Section 482\nCr.P.C.\n5. The 2  respondent/de facto complainant\n\nip\n\n2021/KER/168\n\nCr. MC 8865/2019\n8\n\nrepresented by his wife has appeared through counsel. Smt.\nParvathy P., the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner\nand Sri.Nithyanandan Balagopalan, the learned counsel for the\n2°? respondent as also the learned Public Prosecutor were\nheard. Records perused.\n\n6. The de facto complainant admits that he had gone\nabroad to Saudi Arabia on accepting a job with M/s Manah\nTrading Establishment, Riyadh during the month of May 2011.\n\nHe has been visiting his native place and admittedly, the last\ntime he visited was in March 2018. Thereafter he has not been\nable to return to India because his passport has been illegally\ndetained by the petitioner/accused. Hence, it is contended that\noffences under Section 406 IPC for criminal breach of trust and\n\nip\n\n2021/KER/168\n\nCrl.MC 8865/2019\n9\n\nSection 420 IPC for cheating have been committed by the\npetitioner. The argument advanced by the petitioner seeking\nquashing of the proceedings under Section 482 Cr.P.C are on\ntwo grounds. Firstly, that no offence has been made out prima\nfacie against the petitioner under Section 405 I.P.C or under\nSection 420 |.P.C. Secondly, it is contended that without\ngetting previous sanction of the Central Government, no\ncomplaint can be entertained in India for offences committed\nabroad as contemplated under Section 188 of the Cr.P.C.\n\n7. Per contra, the learned counsel appearing for the 2\"?\nrespondent submits that there is no prohibition under Section\n188 Cr.P.C to take cognisance for offences committed abroad.\nThe sanction under Section 188 Cr.P.C can even be obtained\n\nip\n2021/KER/168\nCr. MC 8865/2019\n10\nsubsequent to the taking of cognizance or arresting of the\naccused.\n\n8. Coming to the 2™ ground of contention raised by\nthe petitioner regarding the maintainability of the complaint in\nview of the prohibition under Section 188 of the Cr.P.C, it will\nhave to be held that the bar in the proviso to Section 188 of\nthe Code applies only to inquiries and trials and not to\ninvestigations. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has in Thota\nVenkiteswaralu v. State of A.P and another [2011(9) SCC 527:\n2011 KHC 4798] held that the Central Government make\norders of sanction under the proviso to Section 188 of the\ncode even after cognisance of offence is taken. Hence, the trial\ncannot proceed beyond cognizance stage without the sanction\n\nip\n2021/KER/168\nCrl.MC 8865/2019\n11\ncontemplated under the proviso to Section 188 Cr.P.C. The\ncontention of the petitioner in this regard is therefore not\nsustainable.\n\n9. It is now to be examined whether there is prima\nfacie material placed before the learned Magistrate against the\npetitioner so as to attract an offence under Section 405\npunishable under Sections 406 and the offence punishable\nunder Section 420 of the I.P.C.\n\n10. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner\nsubmits that going by the allegations made in the complaint\nproduced as Annexure-1 and the other materials produced in\nsupport of the complaint, the main ingredient of entrustment\nfor constituting offence under Section 406 I.P.C is absent in\n\nip\n2021/KER/168\nCrl.MC 8865/2019\n12\nthis case. Inviting attention of this Court towards the\ndefinition of \"criminal breach of trust\" as provided under\nSection 405 I.P.C, it is submitted that the ingredient of criminal\nbreach of trust is absent in the present case and therefore, the\nlearned Magistrate has committed a mistake by proceeding to\nissue Summons to the petitioner. Even if the allegation that the\npassport was entrusted to the accused is to be believed, mere\nrefusal to return the passport entrusted by the complainant\ndoes not satisfy the requirement of Section 405 |.P.C. Refusal\nto return the passport could be on several grounds. The\npetitioner is not proved to be the owner of the organisation in\nwhich the complainant is allegedly working. He has admittedly\nreturned to India after getting employment three times.\n\nug\napes\n2021/KER/168\nCrL.MC 8865/2019\n13\nWithout getting the passport, the complainant could not have\nreturned to India. The offence under Section 405 I.P.C is\ntherefore, committed when property which was entrusted to\nthe accused was actually misappropriated or dishonestly\nconverted for his own use or is otherwise dealt with in the\nmanner indicated by section 405 I.P.C, which reads as under:\n\"405. Criminal breach of trust-Whoever, being\nin any manner entrusted with property, or with\nany dominion over the property, dishonestly\nmisappropriated or converts to his own use that\nproperty, or dishonestly uses or dispose is of\nthat property in violation of any direction of law\nprescribing the board in which such trust is to\nbe discharged, or of any legal contract, express\nor implied, which he has made a touching the\ndischarge of such trust, or wilfully suffers any\nother person so to do, commits open Court\ncriminal breach of trust”.\"\n\nip\n2021/KER/168\nCrl.MC 8865/2019\n14\nIn the complaint it is stated that the petitioner is the owner of\nthe company under the sponsorship of one Mr.Mansoor, a\nSaudi national. It is not understandable why the petitioner\nshould insist on payment of %6 lakhs for releasing the\npassport when admittedly the complainant had on earlier three\noccasions travelled to India with his passport without any\nmoney being paid. There is no allegation that the passport\nallegedly entrusted to the _ petitioner was  dishonestly\nmisappropriated by him or was converted to his own use. It is\ntherefore difficult to hold that the petitioner has prima facie\ncommitted an offence punishable under section 406 I.P.C.\n11. There is no allegation in the complaint that the\npetitioner had fraudulently or dishonestly induced the\n\nip\n2021/KER/168\nCrl.MC 8865/2019\n15\ncomplainant to deposit his passport. To attract an offence of\ncheating it is necessary to show that the accused had\nfraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of providing\nemployment to misappropriate the complainant's passport.\nMere failure on the part of the accused subsequently to\nhandover the passport or refusal to grant leave to travel to\nIndia cannot be interpreted as an offence of cheating\npunishable under Section 420 of the I.P.C such a dishonest\nintention cannot be inferred from the mere fact that the\npassport was not returned to the complainant to facilitate his\ntravel to India. Section 415 1.P.C which defines cheating has\ntwo essential ingredients. Firstly, the accused must\n‘dishonestly' or ‘fraudulently’ induce the complainant to deliver\n\napes\n2021/KER/168\nCrL.MC 8865/2019\n16\nany property. Secondly the accused should have intentionally\ninduced the complainant to deliver that article or do\nsomething. Hence there must be intention at the inception.\n12. In S.W. Palanitkar v. State of Bihar [AIR 2001 SC\n\n2960], it is held thus:\n\n“9. The ingredients in order to constitute a\n\ncriminal breach of trust are: (i)\n\nentrusting a person with property or with any\n\ndominion over property (ii) that persons\n\nentrusted (a) dishonestly misappropriating or\n\nconverting that property to his own use: or (b)\n\ndishonestly using or disposing of that\n\nproperty or wilfully suffering any other person\n\nso to do in violation (i) of any direction of law\n\nproscribing the mode in which such trust is to\n\nbe discharged (ii) of any legal contract made\n\ntouching the discharge of such trust.\n\n10. The ingredients of an offence of cheating\n\nare: (i) there should be fraudulent or\n\nip\n2021/KER/168\nCrL.MC 8865/2019\n17\n\ndishonest inducement of a _ person’ by\n\ndeceiving him, (ii) (a) the person so deceived\n\nshould be induced to deliver any property to\n\nany person, or to consent that any person\n\nshall retain any property; or (b) the person so\n\ndeceived should be intentionally induced to do\n\nor omit to do anything which he would not do\n\nor omit if he were not so deceived; and (iii) in\n\ncases covered by (ii) (b), the act of omission\n\nshould be one which causes or is likely to\n\ncause damage or harm to the person induced\n\nin body, mind, reputation or property.”\nWhen the complaint itself does not disclose the ingredients\nessential to make out an offence of cheating or criminal breach\nof trust as stated above by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the\naccused is entitled to be discharged. (See Samir Sahay @\nSameer Sahay v. State of U.P. and another [AIR 2017 SC 5327)).\nApplying all these precedents, there is no hesitation to hold\n\nip\n2021/KER/168\nCrl.MC 8865/2019\n18\nthat the prosecution against the petitioner needs to be\nquashed exercising the jurisdiction under Section 482 of the\nCr.P.C.\n\nIn the result the Crl.M.C. is allowed and _ entire\nproceedings as against the petitioner herein in CC\nNo.746/2019 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate\nCourt-1, Ottapalam is hereby quashed under Section 482\nCr.P.C.\n\nSd/-\nASHOK MENON\nJUDGE\njg\n\nBeer\n2021/KER/168\nAPPENDIX\n\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\n\nANNEXURE 1 CERTIFIED COPY OF THE COMPLAINT PREFERRED\nBY THE 2ND RESPONDENT AS CMP NO.12874/2019\nBEFORE THE JUDICIAL FIRST CLASS MAGISTRATE-\nI ,OTTAPPALAM.\n\nANNEXURE 2 CERTIFIED COPY OF DAIRY EXTRACT OF CMP\nNO.12874/2019 OF JUDICIAL FIRST CLASS\nMAGISTRATE-1 , OTTAPALAM.\n\n"
