    "outcome": "ORDER\n\nThis is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik\nSuraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail.\n\n2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable\nunder Sections 409 and 420, r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, and\n\n2\nCrime No. 150/2025 of Aruvikkara Police Station is registered against the\npetitioner arraying him as 9\" accused.\n\n3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- The accused Nos.\n1 to 7, who were the staff of Rajiv Gandhi Residents’ Welfare Co-operative\nSociety situated in Nedumangadu Taluk, along with accused Nos. 8 to 16, in\nfurtherance of their common intention to obtain wrongful gain and to cause\nwrongful loss to the depositors in the Society, during the period from\n01.04.2021 to 31.05.2024, committed misappropriation in the deposits, and\nobtained a total sum of Rs.24,74,21,480/- from them.\n\n4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor.\nThe Investigating Officer filed report opposing the anticipatory bail application.\n\n5. Heard. Perused the records.\n\n6. The only point to be considered is, whether an order of anticipatory\nbail can be granted to the petitioner/ 9\" accused.\n\n7. The Point:- The defacto complainant was the Part-Time\nAdministrator of Rajiv Gandhi Residents’ Welfare Co-operative Society. The\nprosecution allegation is that, the accused persons have committed\nmisappropriation of around Rs.24,74,21,480/- by taking loans in benami names\nand by way of advance MDS. The specific allegation against petitioner / 9\"\naccused is that, he had pledged the property in his name as security for\nobtaining different loans and MDS.\n\n3\n\n8. The petitioner submits that, he is a farmer and is not involved in\nany offence, and his brother-in-law, M.Mohankumar, who is a well known\npolitical figure, was the President of Rajiv Gandhi Residents’ Welfare Co-\noperative Society, and he committed suicide, after being falsely accused of\nmisappropriating funds from the said Society. It is submitted that, though more\nthan 60 crimes have been registered against the office bearers of the Society\nbased on various complaints, the petitioner is never named as an accused in any\nof those crimes, since he did not held any post in the said Society, but later, on\n06.02.2025, the Aruvikkara Police registered an F.I.R. against the petitioner\nand 15 others, including some of his family members, alleging misappropriation\nof over Rs.24 Crores from the Society. It is also submitted that, the petitioner\nstood as a surety for one of the chitties in the Bank, and he has no connection\nwith the functioning of the society and the alleged misappropriation of funds,\nand the present crime has been registered due to political vengeance.\n\n9. The allegation against the petitioner is not grave. It is seen from the\nreport filed by the Investigating Officer that, when a search was conducted in\nthe Rajiv Gandhi Residents’ Welfare Co-operative Society, it was found that,\nusing the property and suretyship of accused Nos. 8 to 16, they had availed\nvarious loans and chitties and obtained more than Rs.50 Lakhs in their names\nand in the benami names. It is stated in the bail application that the petitioner\nstood as a surety for one of the chitties in the Bank, and he has no connection\n\n4\n\nwith the functioning of the Society and misappropriation of funds. Even if\nsome documents were found in the name of the petitioner, the relevance of the\nsame in the implication of the crime and the dishonest intention of the petitioner\nis a matter of evidence. The exact role of the petitioner is not brought out by\nthe prosecution. It appears that there is no prima facie case against the\npetitioner. It would be a travesty of justice, if the petitioner is put behind the\nbars, if he has not committed any offence. No criminal antecedents of the\npetitioner is brought to the notice of this court.\n\n10. In view of my discussion above, it appears that there is no\nimpediment in granting a pre-arrest bail to the petitioner. Considering all these\naspects, it is found that this is a fit case where a pre-arrest bail can be granted to\nthe petitioner.\n\nIn the result, the petition is allowed",
