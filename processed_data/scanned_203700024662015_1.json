TO JUDGE\nMn\n\n2015/KER/17442\nANIL K.NARENDRAN, J\nORDER\n\nPetitioners are accused Nos.1 and 3 in Crime No.138/2010 of\nAdhur Police Station, Kasaragod District, which is now pending as\nC.C.No.4188/2014 of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,\nKasaragod. The learned Magistrate took cognizance of the offence\nunder Section 498A of Indian Penal Code, based on a private\ncomplaint filed by the first respondent. Now, it is submitted on\nbehalf of the petitioners that the entire disputes between the\npetitioners and the first respondent have already been settled and\nthe first respondent has also sworn to an affidavit which is produced\nalong with Crl.M.C. as Annexure A6. Therefore, the prayer in this\nCril.M.C. is to quash the entire proceedings in C.C.No.4188/2014 of\nJudicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kasaragod .\n\n2. Heard, the learned counsel for petitioners, learned\ncounsel appearing for the first respondent and the learned Public\nProsecutor for the second respondent.\n\n3. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab (2012 (10) SCC\n\n2015/KER/17442\n\nCrl.M.C.No.2466/15 -2-\n\n303), the Apex Court held that, the power of the High Court in\nquashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of\nits inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power\ngiven to a Criminal Court for compounding the offences under\nSection 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Inherent power is\nof wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be\nexercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power\nviz.; (i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of\nthe process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the\ncriminal proceeding or complaint or FIR may be exercised where\nthe offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend\non the facts and circumstances of each case and no category can\nbe prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High\nCourt must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the\ncrime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or\noffences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly\nquashed even though the victim or victim's family and the\noffender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not private\nin nature and have serious impact on society. Similarly, any\n\n2015/KER/17442\n\nCrl.M.C.No.2466/15 -3-\n\ncompromise between the victim and offender in relation to the\noffences under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act\nor the offences committed by public servants while working in\nthat capacity etc.; cannot provide for any basis for quashing\ncriminal proceedings involving such offences. But criminal cases\nhaving overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour stand on\na different footing for the purpose of quashing, particularly\noffences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil\npartnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out of\nmatrimonial relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where\nthe wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the\nparties have resolved their entire dispute. In these categories of\ncases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings, if in its view,\nbecause of the compromise between the offender and the victim,\nthe possibility of a conviction is remote and bleak and\ncontinuation of criminal case would put accused to great\noppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused\nto him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and\ncomplete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other\n\n2015/KER/17442\n\nCrl.M.C.No.2466/15 -4-\n\nwords, the High Court may consider whether it would be unfair or\ncontrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal\nproceedings or continuation of criminal proceedings would\ntantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and\ncompromise between the victim and wrong-doer and whether to\nsecure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is\nput to an end and if the answer to the above question is in\naffirmative the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to\nquash the criminal proceedings.\n\n4. The allegation against the petitioners is that they have\ncommitted an offence punishable under Section 498A of the\nIndian Penal Code.\n\n5. Now as submitted by both sides, the entire dispute\nbetween the petitioners and the first respondent has already\nbeen settled amicably and the learned counsel for the first\nrespondent has also stated that the first respondent does not\nwant to prosecute the criminal case filed against the petitioners.\nThe first respondent has also sworn to an affidavit before this\nCourt as Annexure A6 in this regard.\n\npase ul\n2015/KER/17442\nCrl.M.C.No.2466/15 -5-\n\n6. In such circumstances, this is a fit case in which the\nproceedings pending against the petitioners in C.C.No.4188/2014\nof Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kasaragod can be\nquashed by this Court invoking the powers under Section 482 of\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure, in the light of the principles laid\ndown by the Apex Court in Gian Sing's case (supra).\n\nIn the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and the entire\nproceedings in C.C.No.4188/2014 of Judicial First Class\nMagistrate Court-I, Kasaragod against the petitioners is quashed.\n\nSd/-\nANIL K.NARENDRAN,\nJUDGE\ndsn\n\n"
