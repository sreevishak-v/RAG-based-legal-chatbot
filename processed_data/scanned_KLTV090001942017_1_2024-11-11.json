The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: Due to that animosity towards\nthe Informant not having given the Accused persons Rs. 500/- (Rupees Five Hundred\nOnly) for consuming alcohol, the Accused persons, in furtherance of their common\nintention, on 10.05.2016 at about 6.00 pm at the road side near Kallampally Junction in\nUlloor Village voluntarily caused hurt to the Informant. The 1* Accused uttered obscene\nwords against the Informant hit on his left forehead and various parts of his body and\nkicked him down. The 2° Accused kicked on his back and punched on his chest. When\nthe Informant attempted to run away from there, the Accused persons wrongfully\nrestrained him and physically assaulted him. Thereby the Accused are alleged to have\ncommitted the above mentioned offences.\n\n3\n\n3. The cognizance was taken on the basis of Final Report in respect of the offences\nunder Sections 294(b),341,323 r/w34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. On issuance of\nprocess, the Accused persons entered appearance. They were enlarged on bail. They\nwere represented by a Counsel of their own choice. Copies of all relevant Prosecution\nrecords were furnished to them. After hearing both parties and on perusing relevant\nrecords, particulars of the offences under Sections 294(b),341,323 r/w34 of the Indian\nPenal Code, 1860 was read over and explained to them, to which they pleaded not\nguilty and claimed to be tried.\n4. From the side of Prosecution CW1 and CW7 was examined as PW1 and PW2\nrespectively and Exhibits P1 to P4 were marked and Exhibit P5 was marked subject to\nproof. The presence of CWs 2 to 4 could not be procured by the Prosecution, despite\nsteps having been issued against them. The Learned Assistant Public Prosecutor gave\nup the CWs 5 and 6, as the Injured himself turned hostile to the Prosecution and\nProsecution evidence was closed. Since no incriminating circumstances arose against\nthe Accused persons from the deposition of the witnesses, their examination under\nSection 313 (1)(b) of the CrPC was dispensed with. No evidence was adduced from the\nside of the Defence.\n5. Heard both sides and perused the documents. The following points arise for\nconsideration.\n\n(a) Have the Accused Persons in furtherance of their common intention on\n\nuttered obscene words to PW1 and thereby committed offence punishable under\n\nSection 294(b) r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged?\n\n(b) Have the Accused Persons in furtherance of their common intention on\n\nthe wrongfully restrained PW1 and thereby committed offence punishable under\n\nSection 341 r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged?\n\n4\n\n(c) Have the Accused Persons in furtherance of their common intention, on\n\nthe voluntarily caused hurt to PW1 and thereby committed the offence\n\npunishable under section 323 r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged\n\n(d) If so, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded?\n\n6. Points (a) to (c): These points are considered together for the sake of brevity and\nfor avoiding repetition.\n\nPW1 denied having statement to police to the effect that he sustained injury in\nthe incident and that he had gone to the hospital at the instance of the police officials\nalone. However, he admitted his signature in Exhibit P1 Statement.\n\nPW2 deposed that he was the Sation House Officer, Sreekaryam police station\nduring the relevant period of time. He recorded statement of PW1. On the basis of Ext\nP1 FIS, he registered First Information Report for the offences under sections 294(b), 34,\n323 and 34 of the IPC. Exhibit P1(a) is the body note of the PW1. Exhibit P2 is the Scene\nMahazar prepared by him. Exhibits P3, P3(a) are the bail bonds of the Accused persons\nand. Exhibit P4 is the Address Report of the Accused persons. Exhibit P5 (subject to\nproof) is the Wound Certificate of PW1. He denied that deposition of PW1 that he had\nnot given Exhibit P1 Statement. To the suggestion put by the Learned Counsel for the 1*\nAccused, PW2 admitted that the Accused persons were not made to be identified by the\nwitnesses.\n\nI have carefully considered the evidence adduced by the Prosecution and the\nmaterials on record, as well as the submissions of the Learned APP and the Leaned\nCounsel for the Accused. Although there is body note of the Injured, wound certificate\netc., it is pertinent to note that PW1, the injured is having no case that the Accused\npersons have assaulted him. PW1 even denied having given statement to the police. The\n\n5\n\nwound certificate cannot be considered as the same is not proved and the doctor who\nhad examined PW1 has not appeared before this Court. The occurrence witness did not\nturn up before this Court and the Prosecution failed to procure their presence. Hence,\nremaining witnesses were given up by the Prosecution as no purpose would be served\nin examining them, when the Injured herself has no case supporting the Prosecution.\nThe materials on record when considered in light of the deposition of PW1, cuts to the\nroot of the Prosecution case as there is nothing to implicate the involvement of the\nAccused persons in the alleged crime. These points are thus answered in favour of the\nAccused persons.\n\n8. Point (d): In light of finding in the foregoing points, this point does not arise for\nconsideration.\n\nIn the result, Accused Nos 1 and 2 are found not guilty of having committed\nthe offences punishable under Sections 294(b),341,323 r/w34 of the IPC. They are\nacquitted of the aforesaid offences under Section 248(1) of the CrPC. Their bail bonds\nstand cancelled and they are set at liberty.\n\n(Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected\nby me and pronounced in open Court on this, the 11\" day of November, 2024.)\n\nJudicial Magistrate of First Class -I,\nThiruvananthapuram\nAPPENDIX\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\n\n6\nwitness, Medical witness,\nOther witness\nPW1 Prasannakumar(CW1) Occurrence Witness\nexamined on 10.01.2022\nPW2 S Shaji Kumar (CW7) examined |Police witness\non 01.10.2024.\n\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical witness,\nOther witness\n\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\n\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical witness,\nOther witness\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA.
