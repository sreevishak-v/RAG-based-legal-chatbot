TO JUDGE\nbp\n\nPan\n2016/KER/33877\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN, V., J.\nDated this the 3” day of August, 2016\nORDER\n\n1.The 1* Petitioner is the owner of a lorry bearing Reg.No.\nKL-40-D-8794. On 3.7.2016, the said vehicle was seized\nby the 2\" respondent on the allegation that the vehicle\nwas used for transporting ordinary earth, in violation to\nthe provisions under the Kerala Minerals (Prevention of\nillegal Mining, Storage and Transportation) Rules, 2015\n(hereinafter referred to as “the Transportation\nRules,2015”).\n\n2.As per Rule 32 of the Transportation Rules, 2015, any\noffence punishable under the said rules can be\ncompounded, either before or after the institution of the\nprosecution, by the person authorized under Section 22 of\n\npee\n2016/KER/33877\nCri.M.C. No.4279 of 2016\n-2-\n\nthe Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act,\n1957 or clause (ii) of Rule 2 of the Transportation Rules,\n2015, to make a complaint to the Court with respect to\nthat offence, on payment to that person, for credit to the\nGovernment, of such sum as that person may specify.\nReferring to Annexure-A2, it is submitted that the 3”\nrespondent is the officer authorised to make a complaint\nto the Court or to compound the offence.\n\n3.The grievance of the petitioners is that the vehicle has not\nbeen produced before the 3% respondent till date. The\nprayer in this petition is to issue direction to the 2\"\nrespondent to act in terms of the Transportation Rules,\n2015 and to produce the vehicle seized before the 3\"\nrespondent. It is further prayed that directions be issued\nto the 3% respondent to provide an opportunity to the\npetitioner to compound the offence under Rule 32 of the\nTransportation Rules, 2015.\n\nBIAS\nieee\n2016/KER/33877\n\nCrI.M.C. No.4279 of 2016\n\n=-3-\n\n4.I have heard the learned Public Prosecutor as well.\n\n5.I find considerable merit in the submission of the learned\ncounsel. It is evident on a reading of Rule 32 of the\nTransportation Rules, 2015 and also S.R.O No. 375 of\n2015 produced by the petitioners that the 3 respondent\nis the competent authority to prefer complaint before the\nlearned Magistrate and also to allow the compounding of\nthe offence. Hence, the following directions are issued, to\nsecure the ends of justice :-\n\ni. The 2™ respondent is directed to produce\nthe aforesaid vehicle involved in the offence\nbefore the 3% respondent within a period of\ntwo days from the date of receipt of a copy of\nthis order.\n\nii. |The 3\" respondent shall permit the\npetitioners to compound the offence under Rule\n32 of the Rules, if the same is permissible\nunder law.\n\niii. The above endeavour shall be completed\n\nDrea\nBia\n2016/KER/33877\nCrI.M.C. No.4279 of 2016\n-4-\nwithin a period of 5 days from the date of\nreceipt of this order.\nIf the offence is compounded in terms of Rule 32 of the\nTransportation Rules, 2015, necessarily the vehicle shall\nbe released forthwith. This petition is disposed off.\nSd/-\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN, V.\nJUDGE\nPs/5/8/16\n\nBe shal\napes\n2016/KER/33877\nCri.M.C. No.4279 of 2016\n-5-\n\n"
