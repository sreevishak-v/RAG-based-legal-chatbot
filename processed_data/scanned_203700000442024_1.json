CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n10.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\n2024/KER/2012\nCRL.MC NO. 44 OF 2024 2\nORDER\n\nThis Crl.M.C is at the instance of the accused persons in CC\nNo.58/2018 of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Paravoor,\nKollam, for quashing Annexure A2 final report, which is pending\nas CC No. 58/2018 on the file of that court.\n\n2. The grievance of the petitioners is that, though trial in CC\nNo.58/2018 has begun and non bailable warrant has been issued\nagainst the witnesses, in fact no offence is made out against\nthe petitioners, going by the prosecution allegations. Moreover,\n3 petitioner is a 73 year old lady, and she finds it difficult to\nappear before court. Obviously, the trial in CC No.58/2018 has\ncommenced, and non bailable warrant has been issued against\nthe witnesses to procure their presence for examination. At this\nstage, there is no question of quashing the final report, on the\nground that, the essential ingredients are not made out to\nconstitute the offence, which can only be brought out through\nthe evidence of the witnesses. To prove or disprove the facts\nalleged evidence is required, for which examination of witnesses\nis scheduled. So this Court could not find any merit in this\n\netn\npat\n2024/KER/2012\nCRL.MC NO. 44 OF 2024 3\npetition, and hence it is liable to be dismissed. Meanwhile, the\ntrial court is directed to expedite the trial in CC No.58/2018, and\nto dispose it of, at the earliest, at any rate, within a period of\nfour months from today. If the petitioners 2 and 3 make\nappropriate application for exemption from appearance due to\ntheir old age or ill-health, learned magistrate has to consider it\nfavourably.\nAccordingly, this Crl.M.C is dismissed.\nRegistry to forward a copy of this order to the trial court\nforthwith.\nSd/-\nSOPHY THOMAS\nJUDGE\nSka\n\naa\nace Tecra\nPz aoe\n2024/KER/2012\nCRL.MC NO. 44 OF 2024 4\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 44/2024\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES\nAnnexure Ad THE CERTIFIED COPY OF THE F.1I.R NO.2352/2017,\nDATED 09.11.2017 OF PARAVOOR POLICE STATION\nAnnexure A2 A CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT IN\nC.C.NO.58/2018 DATED 20.1.2018, PENDING ON\nTHE FILE OF THE LEARNED JFCM COURT AT\nPARAVOOR\n\n"
