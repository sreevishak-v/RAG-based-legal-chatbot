This case is instituted upon the Final Report filed by the Sub Inspector of\nPolice, Karamana Police Station in Crime No. 1610/2016 for the offences\npunishable under Sections 294(b), 323, 341 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code,\n1860(hereinafter referred to as the’IPC’)\n2. The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: The Accused Persons\ninorder to wreck vengeance against the Informant for having required the 2™\nAccused to dim the headlight of his scooter; in furtherance of their common\nintention, voluntarily assaulted the Informant on 21.10.2016 at 8.30 pm at the\npublic road premises near Killipalam over bridge. The 1* Accused wrongfully\nrestrained the Informant and fisted on his chest repeatedly and pushed him on the\nroad. The 24 Accused showered obscene words on the Informant. Thereby the\nAccused are alleged to have committed the above mentioned offences.\n3. The cognizance was taken on the basis of Final Report in respect of the\noffences under Sections 294(b), 323, 341 r/w 34 of the IPC. On issuance of process,\nthe Accused Persons entered appearance before this Court. They were enlarged on\nbail. They were represented by a Counsel of their own choice. Copies of all\nrelevant Prosecution records were furnished to them. Particulars of Offences were\n\n3\nread over and the same was read over and explained to them, to which they\npleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.\n4. From the side of Prosecution CW1 alone was examined as PW1 and Exhibit\nP1 was marked. The remaining witnesses were given up by the Learned APP as the\nmaterial witness, the injured herself had turned hostile to the case of Prosecution.\nSince no incriminating circumstances arose from the depositions of the witnesses,\nthe examination of the Accused under Section 313(1)(b) of the CrPC was dispensed\nwith. No Defence evidence was also adduced.\n5. Heard both sides and perused the documents. The following points arise for\nconsideration:\n\n(a) Have the Accused persons, in furtherance of their common intention,\n\nuttered obscene words to PW1 and thereby committed the offence\n\npunishable under section 294 (b)r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged\n\n(b) Have the Accused persons, in furtherance of their common intention,\n\nvoluntarily caused hurt to PW1 and thereby committed offence punishable\n\nunder Section 323 of the IPC as alleged?\n\n(c) Have the Accused persons, in furtherance of their common intention,\n\nwrongfully restrained PW1 and thereby committed offence punishable under\n\nSection 341 of the IPC as alleged?\n\n(d) If so, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded?\n\n6. Points (a) to (c): These points are considered together for the sake of\nbrevity and for avoiding repetition.\n\nPWI1 deposed that he sustained injury in the alleged incident. He was hit\nand on account of the same, he fell down. He deposed that he had given Exhibit\nPi First Information Statement to the police officials regarding the alleged\nincident. He deposed that he does not remember the exact date of the incident\n\n4\nand the same occurred pursuant to 7.00 pm at Killippalam. PW1 categorically\ndenied the identity of the persons who had allegedly assaulted him and further\ndeposed that he does not know how many people had so assaulted him. He\nfurther deposed that he could not identify the persons who had allegedly assaulted\nhim and that he does not know whether the Accused persons were amongest them.\n\nOn perusal of the evidence led by the Prosecution and the materials on\nrecord, it is evident that the injured himself has deposed against the version of the\nProsecution. Though PW1 admitted to have sustained injuries, and having given\nExhibit P1 statement to the Police; he categorically denied knowledge as to the\nidentity of the people who had allegedly assaulted him. Further he is not having a\ncase that it was the Accused Persons who had allegedly assaulted him. There is no\nevidence forthcoming as regards the ingredients of the offences alleged. The\nremaining witnesses were given up by the Prosecution since no purpose would be\nserved by examining them in the aforesaid circumstance wherein the injured\nhimself has turned hostile to the case of Prosecution. Thus, there is nothing on the\nrecord so as to implicate the Accused Persons to the alleged incident. Hence Points\n(a) to (c) are found in favour of the Accused.\n\n7. Point (d): In light of finding in the foregoing points, this point does not\narise for consideration.\n\nIn the result, the Accused Nos.1 and 2 are found not guilty of having\ncommitted the offences punishable under Sections 294(b), 323, 341 r/w 34 of the\nIPC. They are acquitted of the aforesaid offences under Section 255(1) of the\nCrPC. Their bail bond stands cancelled and they are set at liberty.\n\n(Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her,\ncorrected by me and pronounced in open Court on this, the 6\" day of February,\n2025.)\n\nJudicial Magistrate of I Class -I,\nThiruvananthapuram\n\n5\nAPPENDIX\nA: Prosecution witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nPW1 Gopinathan Nair(CW1) Ocurrence witness\nexamined on 14.11.2023\nB: Defence witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nC: Court witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA.
