According to the petitioner, as he has shifted his\nresidence to his present address in Tamil Nadu, he did not receive\nthe summons issued to him. It is stated that the learned\nMagistrate in the circumstances issued warrant of arrest against\nthe petitioner. The petitioner is prepared to surrender before the\ncourt below, but he apprehends that if he surrenders, he will be\nremanded to judicial custody. The petitioner, therefore, seeks\ndirections to the court below to recall the warrant of arrest issued\nagainst him and enlarge him on bail on his appearance.\n\n2. Should the warrant of arrest issued against the\npetitioner be recalled and should he be released on bail are\nmatters for the learned Magistrate to consider. There is absolutely\nno reason to think that if the petitioner surrenders before the\ncourt below and satisfactorily explain the cause for his non-\nappearance, the learned Magistrate would mechanically remand\nhim to custody, without considering the application for bail.\n\nSacre\n|\n2020/KER/761\nCri.M.C.No.5985 of 2019 3\nHowever, having regard to the submissions made at the\nBar, this Crl.M.C. is closed, with a direction to the court below that\nif the petitioner applies for bail on surrender, the same shall be\nconsidered and disposed of on the date of surrender itself, with\nnotice to the Assistant Public Prosecutor.\nSd/-\nP.B.SURESH KUMAR, JUDGE.\nYKB\n\nDTU: Fag.\na\nCane\n2020/KER/761\nCri.M.C.No.5985 of 2019 4\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE I THE CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FIRST INFORMATION\nREPORT IN CRIME NO. 2089/2011 OF\nPALARIVATTOM POLICE STATION DATED 12-11-\n2011\nANNEXURE IT THE TRUE PHOTOCOPY OF THE STUDYING\nCERTIFICATE DATED 25-11-2011 ISSUED FROM\nTHE GOVERNMENT BOYS HIGHER SECONDARY\nSCHOOL, PAPPIREDDIPATTI, DHARMNAPURI\nDISTRICT, TAMILNADU\nANNEXURE IIT THE TRUE PHOTOCOPY OF THE TRANSLATION OF\nTHE SALE DEED IN ENGLISH RELATING TO THE\nPROPERTY BELONGS TO THE MOTHER OF THE\nPETITIONER.\nANNEXURE IV THE TRUE PHOTOCOPY OF THE VALUATION OF THE\nPROPERTY AND IDENTITY OF THE PARTY ISSUED\nBY THE TAHASTLDAR, PAPPIREDDIPATTI DATED\n24-11-2011\nANNEXURE V THE CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT INC\nRIME NO. 2089/2011 OF PALARIVATTOM POLICE\nSTATION DATED 21-02-2011 FILED BEFORE THE\nHONOURABLE JUDICIAL FIRST CLASS MAGISTRATE\nCOURT-1, ERNAKULAM\nANNEXURE VI THE TRUE PHOTOCOPY OF THE SUMMONS IN C.C.\nNO.1213 OF 2016 DATED 17-04-2017 ISSUED BY\nTHE HONOURABLE JUDICIAL FIRST CLASS\nMAGISTRATE COURT-IX, ERNAKULAM\nANNEXURE VII THE CERTIFIED COPY OF THE PROCEEDING SHEET\nIN C.cC NO. 1213 OF 2016 ON JUDICIAL FIRST\nCLASS MAGISTRATE COURT-IX, ERNAKULAM\nRESPONDENT'S/S EXHIBITS:\nNIL\n//TRUE COPY//\nPA TO JUDGE\n\n"
