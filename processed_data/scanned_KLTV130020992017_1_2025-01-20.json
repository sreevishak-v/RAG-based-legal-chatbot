Evidence adduced by the prosecution : PW1 Shamsunnissa is the owner of\nthe said house no.70/1857 .She deposed that the theft was committed in the\nyear 2013 ,when she came back to her house from her sister’s house she found\nthat the back door of her house and shelf in the room were broken and her\nbriefcase which contained ID card,passport ,rings weighing 6 gm and 2 gm ,ea\nrring weighing 1 sovereign , ‘matti of half sovereign ,bracelet of half sovereign\n.She further admitted her signature in the Ext P1 statement .According to her\nshe is not aware of the person who committed theft.\n\n6 of 12\n\n8.

PW3 S.Kumar was examined by the prosecution to prove the recovery mahazar\n-He admitted his signature in the Ext P2 recovery mahasar .According to him\nhe cannot recollect the persons present at the time of recovery .\n\n10.PW4 chandran .L was the sub Inspector of police during the time of alleged\nincident .The investigation of the above case was conducted by\nPW4 .According to him he prepared Ext P3 scene mahasar .He further deposed\nthat in pursuance of the Ext P2 (a) statement given by the accused no.2 that\n“Mo IGamMoIsoamMesss ANQ HSQJo GIG AIH GHABCO}o 6008 06M 1.94 O00”\nThe gold ornaments were recovered .He further deposed that on getting\ninformation that the stolen documents were kept in the house of the accused\nno.3 a search was conduted in the said house but nothing could be recovered\nfrom there .\n\n11.PW5 Saji deposed that he was registered the Ext P8 FIR .\n\n12.Submissions made by the learned counsel for the accused no.2: The\nlearned counsel submitted that the accused no.2 is innocent and he is not\ninvolved in the case ,in fact he was falsely implicated by the police .\n\n7 of 12\n\n13.Submissions made by the learned counsel for the accused _no.3: The\nlearned counsel for the accused no.3 submitted that the accused has been\nimplicated by the police and there is no direct or any circumstantial evidence to\nprove the guilt of the accused .\n\n14.Submissions made by the Learned APP :_ The learned APP submitted that\nthough there is no direct eye witness, the recovery it self is sufficient to prove\nthe role of the accused persons and their guilt Since the recovery has been\nproved the accused persons are not entitled to get an acquittal .\n\n15.Evaluation of the Evidence : PW1 is the owner of the house where the theft\nhas been committed and she is the owner of the property,she is not aware\nabout the person who committed the theft .PW2 Hajira Beevi denied her\nstatement that the accused persons committed the offence and she turned\nhostile to the prosecution case .To prove the recovery mahasar PW3 S.Kumar\nwas examined, though he admitted the signature in the Ext P2 recovery\nmahasar he further stated in the examination in chief it self that he doesn’t\nknow who were present at the time when the recovery has been effected .\nFurthermore he stated in the cross examination that he is not aware of the facts\nof the case as well as the contents of the recovery mahasar .According to him\nas demanded by the police he put his signature in the scene mahasar .\n\n8 of 12\n16.Now let's examine whether the recovery of the gold ornaments in pursuance of\nthe information given by the accused is sufficient or not to tie the accused no.2\nand 3 with the allegations or not .S.27 of the Indian Evidence Act provides that\n‘S.27. How much of information received from accused may be proved:\nProvided that, when any fact is deposed to as discovered in consequence of\ninformation received from a person accused of any offence, in the custody of a\npolice-officer, so much of such information, whether it amounts to a confession\nor not, as relates distinctly to the fact thereby discovered, may be proved. As\nper the Ext P2(a) statement accused no.2 while he was in the custody of police\nstated that “ qoj@emosaemessd Ag ASQo GIO” ANEW GHOSQo amos\n£06112] ®@d0” . In pursuance of his statement the recovery of gold ornaments\nwere made by PW4 from Annamalai Gold Ornaments designers and makers\nshop. In the Ext P2 (a) statement he is not stated anything about the place\nwhere he sold the gold ornaments . As per his statement he merely said that he\nwill show the shop where he sold the gold ornaments .Is that sufficient to prove\nthe recovery? . In, State of Rajasthan v. Bhup Singh (1997) 10 SCC 675,the\nApex Court has observed the following as the conditions prescribed in Section\n27 of the Evidence Act, 1872 for unwrapping the cover of the ban against the\nadmissibility of statement of the accused to the police (1) a fact should have\nbeen discovered in consequence of the information received from the accused;\n(2) he should have been accused of an offence; (3) he should have been in the\ncustody of a police officer when he supplied the information; (4) the fact so\n\n9 of 12\n\ndiscovered should have been deposed to by the witness. The Court observed\nthat if these conditions are satisfied, that part of the information given by the\naccused which led to such recovery gets denuded of the wrapper of prohibition\nand it becomes admissible in evidence. Apart from that the statement does not\ncontain any information about the place where he had sold out the gold ,not as\nsuch stated.The statement should be such that the investigating officer would\nbe able to recover the gold even in the absence of the accused . Furthermore\nthe investigating officer i.e,PW4 has not deposed anything about the contents\nof Ext P2 recovery mahasar .\n\n17.In Anand Kumar v.State of Kerala 2024 KHC online 1517 it was observed\nby the honourable apex court that ‘It is now well established that if the\ninvestigating agency proposes to proceed with the recovery of material objects\non the basis of the confession made by the accused in police custody, the\npresence of two independent witnesses shall be ensured from the very\ninception when the accused starts making the disclosure. The statements so\nmade by the accused shall be recorded by the Investigating Officer in the\npresence of those independent witnesses. Thereafter, the independent witnesses\nshould be present all along when the accused along with the Investigating\nOfficer proceeds to the place of concealment, and the accused retrieves the\nmaterial object, and it is handed over to the Investigating Officer. Furthermore,\nthe Investigating Officer and the independent witnesses have to depose before\nthe Court during trial about the whole course followed, right from the making\n\n10 of 12\n\nof disclosures, till the retrieval and hand over of the material objects. It is trite\nthat the Investigating Officer has to depose before the Trial Court the facts\ndiscovered in consequence of the information received from the accused '.In\nthe present case the recovery has not been effected in the presence of two\nindependent witness ,moreover PW3 himself though admitted his signature in\nthe Ext P2 mahasar has deposed that he doesn't know the facts of the case as\nwell as the contents of Ext P2 .\n\n18.8.457 of Indian Penal Code 1860 ,provides Whoever commits lurking house-\ntrespass by night, or house-breaking by night in order to the committing of any\noffence punishable with imprisonment, shall be punished with imprisonment of\neither description for a term which may extend to five years, and shall also be\nliable to fine;\n\nAnd, if the offence intended to be committed is theft, the term of the\nimprisonment may be extended to fourteen years. $.380 of Indian Penal\nCode states that Whoever commits theft in any building, tent or vessel,\nwhich building, tent or vessel is used as a human dwelling, or used for\nthe custody of property, shall be punished with imprisonment of either\ndescription for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be\nliable to fine.\n\n19.Though the gold ornaments were recovered ,since the recovery has not been\nmade in accordance with the mandate of S.27 of the evidence Act ,based on\n\n11 of 12\nthe dictum laid down by the hon'ble apex courts cited above, it can not be said\nthat the recovery, as far as the facts of this case is concerned, is proved by the\nprosecution beyond any reasonable doubt. Apart from that there is no direct or\nany circumstantial evidence to fasten accused nos. 2 and 3 with the allegations\nlevelled against them. For the said reason point no.1 and 2 are found against\nthe prosecution.\n\n18.Point No.3 :- Upon the finding in point nos. 1 and 2, Accused Nos. 2 and 3 are\nfound not guilty of offences punishable under sections 457 and 380 read with\nsection 34 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 and they are acquitted of the said\noffences under section 248(1) Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Their bail\nbonds stand cancelled and they are set at liberty.
