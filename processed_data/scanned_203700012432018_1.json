No.203 of 2012 Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate,\nThiruvananthapuram ordered issuance of summons to the\npetitioners under Section 204 Cr.P.C. which is challenged in these\npetitions. |The criminal law was set in motion by the second\nrespondent, who filed Annexure-I complaint before the learned\nMagistrate alleging commission of the offences under Sections\n86(1) and 86(2) of the Kerala Prisons And Correctional Services\n(Management) Act, 2010 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Act’).\n\nCrl.M.C. No.1236 of 2018\n\n2. Petitioner is the first accused. In one case the Supreme\nCourt convicted him, who is a former Minister, of an offence\nunder the Prevention of Corruption Act and sentenced him to\n\nbie\n2019/KER/242\n\nCrl.M.C. 1236/18 & Conn. Cases ~262-\n\nundergo imprisonment for a certain term. He was lodged in\nCentral Prison, Poojappura (Thiruvananthapuram). From there\nhe was shifted to a private hospital at Thiruvananthapuram for\ntreatment of certain illness on 5.8.2011. It is stated in the\ncomplaint that on 29.11.2011 at the hospital a reporter of a\ntelevision channel called him on his mobile phone; the second\naccused handed over the mobile phone to him, who talked to the\nreporter on the phone; the jail authorities received complaints in\nconnection with this incident; they took action against the\npetitioner only for the offence under Section 81 of the Act though\nthe facts reveal commission of the offences under Sections 86(1)\nand 86(2) of the Act also.\n\n3. The learned Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate took\ncognizance of the offences mentioned in the complaint and\nconducted enquiry and issued process to 204 persons though\nthere are only two named accused in the complaint, the first of\nwhom being the petitioner. In this Crl.M.C. the order taking\ncognizance is challenged on the following grounds: (i) only the\njail authorities can initiate proceedings against the petitioner (ii)\nthe petitioner did not use mobile phone as alleged in the\ncomplaint, and (iii) the facts of the case do not constitute any\n\nbeens\n2019/KER/242\nCrl.M.C. 1236/18 & Conn. Cases =7i-\noffence.\n\n4. Heard the learned Senior Counsel and others for the\npetitioners, and the learned Public Prosecutor.\n\n5. By the impugned order the learned Additional Chief\nJudicial Magistrate has found that there are sufficient grounds to\nproceed against the 204 accused including the petitioner for the\noffences under Sections 86(1) and 86(2) of the Act.\n\n6. Sub-section 3 of section 86 of the Act provides that the\noffences under sub-sections 1 and 2 are cognizable. The Act\ndoes not provide that cognizance of the said offences can be\ntaken only on the complaint of prison officers. The first ground\nurged in the Crl.M.C. is devoid of merit.\n\n7. Another ground on the basis of which the impugned\norder is sought to be set aside is that the allegation in the\ncomplaint that the petitioner used mobile phone to talk to a\nmedia reporter is not true. The truth of this allegation, which is\na question of fact, cannot be decided in this proceedings.\n\n8. The only ground which deserves notice of the court is\nthat the facts of the case do not reveal commission of the\noffence under sub-section 1 or sub-section 2 of Section 86 of the\nAct.\n\n| Ht aes\n2019/KER/242\nCrl.M.C. 1236/18 & Conn. Cases -:8:-\n\n9. Section 86 of the Act runs as follows:\n\n“86. Punishment in certain cases.- (1) Whoever, in\ncontravention of any provisions of the Act, brings or\nremoves or attempts by any means whatever to bring or\nremove, into or from any prison, or supplies or attempts\nto supply to any prisoner outside the limits of a prison,\nany prohibited article, and any officer or member of staff\nof a prison who, contrary to any rule, knowingly suffers\nany such article to be brought into or removed from any\nprison, to be possessed by any prisoner, or to be supplied\nto any prisoner outside the limits of a prison, and\nwhoever, contrary to any rule, communicates or attempts\nto communicate with any prisoner, and whoever abets\nany offence made punishable by this section, shall, on\nconviction before a Magistrate, be liable to imprisonment\nfor a term not exceeding twelve months, or to fine not\nexceeding ten thousand rupees or with both.\n\n(2) Whoever, being a prisoner or a visitor, or a\nprison official, is found in possession of an electronic\ncommunication or other equipment inside the prison\nagainst the provisions of the Act or rules, or found to be\nmanipulating, damaging or destroying any equipment,\nelectronic or otherwise, in the prison, shall on conviction,\nbefore a Magistrate, be liable to imprisonment for a term\nnot exceeding two years or fine not exceeding ten\nthousand rupees or with both.\n\n(3) The offences mentioned in sub-sections (1) and\n(2) above, shall be cognizable and non-bailable.”\n\n10. Section 2(xxxiii) of the Act defines prison: “Prison\nmeans any jail or place used permanently or temporarily under\nthe general or special order of the Government for the detention\nof prisoners and includes all lands and buildings appurtenant\nthereto”. (The rest of the definition being not relevant is\nomitted).\n\nbie\n2019/KER/242\nCrl.M.C. 1236/18 & Conn. Cases -:9:-\n\n11. It is not disputed before me that the hospital where\nthe petitioner had been lodged was a prison for the purpose of\nthe Act because of the special order passed by the Government.\n\n12. Section 86(1) becomes applicable in three situations.\n(1) When, a person, in contravention of any provisions of the\nAct, brings or removes, or attempts by any means whatever to\nbring or remove, into or from any prison, or supplies or attempts\nto supply to any prisoner outside the limits of a prison, any\nprohibited article. (2) When any officer or member of staff of a\nprison who, contrary to any rule, knowingly suffers any\nprohibited article to be brought into or removed from any prison,\nto be possessed by any prisoner, or to be supplied to any\nprisoner outside the limits of a prison and (3) When a person\ncontrary to any rule communicates or attempts to communicate\nwith any prisoner.\n\n13. There is no allegation in the complaint that it was the\npetitioner who brought the mobile phone allegedly used by him\nin the premises of the hospital where the occurrence allegedly\ntook place. So the first situation is not attracted. The second\nsituation arises only if the offender is an officer or member of\nstaff of a prison. Obviously, this is not applicable to the\n\nbie\n2019/KER/242\n\nCrl.M.C. 1236/18 & Conn. Cases ~:10:-\n\npetitioner because he is neither an officer nor member of staff of\n\na prison. The third situation also has not arisen in this case\nbecause it is applicable only when the offender is a person other\nthan a prisoner. The facts of the case thus do not attract Section\n86(1) of the Act.\n\n14. The only question that requires consideration now is\nwhether the facts alleged in the compliant constitute the offence\nunder sub-section (2) of Section 86 of the Act. This sub-section\nhas two limbs. The first limb makes possession of an electronic\ncommunication or other equipment inside the prison against the\nprovisions of the Act or Rules. The offender may be a prisoner\nor visitor or prison official. The second limb is concerned with\nmanipulating, damaging or destroying any equipment electronic\nor otherwise in the prison. There is no allegation that the\npetitioner has done any of these acts. So the second limb is not\nattracted.\n\n15. The first limb of sub-section (2) of Section 86 is\nattracted only if the petitioner was found in possession of an\nelectronic communication or other equipment. The specific\nallegation against him is that he talked to a TV channel reporter\non a mobile phone which was handed over to him by the second\n\nbie\n2019/KER/242\n\nCrl.M.C. 1236/18 & Conn. Cases ~:11:-\n\naccused. The subscriber of the phone was the petitioner, the\nnumber being 9447155555. It is the definite case of the second\nrespondent/complainant that the mobile phone was in the\npossession of the second accused. He only allowed the\npetitioner to use it when a call came on the phone from a\nreporter of a TV channel. Possession is a relationship between a\nperson and a thing. It shall pass the test of control. Using a\nmobile phone is different from possessing a mobile phone. The\nfacts alleged in the complaint are not sufficient to hold that the\npetitioner was in possession of the mobile phone.\n\n16. I have perused the sworn statement of the second\nrespondent/complainant. His sworn statement is perfunctory in\nnature. Admittedly, he has no direct knowledge about the\npossession of the mobile phone by the petitioner during the\nrelevant period. What is mentioned in the sworn statement is\nthat the second respondent/complainant saw in the media the\npetitioner talking to a news reporter on a mobile phone. This is\nno reason to hold that the latter was in possession of the mobile\nphone at the relevant time. The sworn statement of the second\nrespondent further discloses that in a letter sent by the\nAdditional Director General of Prisons there is a mention that\n\nBeall\nbeens\n2019/KER/242\n\nCrl.M.C. 1236/18 & Conn. Cases ~112:-\ncomplaint had been received that the petitioner used mobile\nphone unauthorisedly in prison. This is not sufficient to hold that\nthe petitioner was in possession of a mobile phone. The other\nrelevant statement in the sworn statement is that the second\nrespondent learnt that the petitioner had called others and\nothers called him during his imprisonment. This also does not\nlead to the conclusion that the petitioner was in possession of a\nmobile phone.\n\n17. Even if it is assumed that the petitioner used the\nmobile phone, it cannot be held that he was in its possession.\nThus, one of the essential elements to attract the offence under\nSection 86(2) of the Act is missing in this case. The learned\nAdditional Chief Judicial Magistrate went wrong in taking\ncognizance of the offence under Section 86(2) of the Act and\nissuing process to the petitioner.\n\nCrl.M.C. Nos.1571 & 1243 of 2018\n\n18. Petitioners in Crl.M.C. No.1571 of 2018 are accused 85\nand 98, and the petitioner in Crl.M.C. No.1243 of 2018 is\naccused No.92 in C.C. No.203 of 2012 on the file of the\nAdditional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Thiruvananthapuram.\n\n19. The complaint of the second respondent shows that\n\n2019/KER/242\n\nCrl.M.C. 1236/18 & Conn. Cases ~113:-\n\nthere are several accused in the case. But only the names of i*\nand 2\"? accused are disclosed. The other accused are shown as\npersons whose involvement will be revealed in the enquiry which\nmay be conducted by the court under Section 202 Cr.P.C. The\nlearned Chief Judicial Magistrate after recording the sworn\nstatement of the second respondent, sent for the details of the\ncalls made from and calls made to the mobile phone\nNo.9447155555, whose subscriber is the first accused (petitioner\nin Crl.M.C. No.1236/2018).\n\n20. The impugned order does not disclose why the\npetitioners in these Crl.M.Cs are made _ accused. The\nendorsement made in the proceedings sheet by the learned\nMagistrate on 6.3.2012, which is the date of the impugned order,\nruns thus: “Incorporate the name and address of the persons\nshown in the memo into the cause title of the complaint.” (sic)\nThis does not make any sense. What can be gathered from the\nrecords of the lower court is that the call details of the mobile\nphone of the first accused collected from the telephone company\nrevealed that there were several incoming and outgoing calls\nduring the relevant period.\n\n21. For the sole reason that neither the complaint nor the\n\nbie\n2019/KER/242\nCrl.M.C. 1236/18 & Conn. Cases ~:14:-\nimpugned order shows the reason for arraigning the petitioners\nas accused, the impugned order is liable to be set aside.\n\n22. Anyone could have made a call to the phone, the\nsubscriber of which was the first accused even though the first\naccused was not in physical possession of the mobile phone. So\nalso any person other than the first accused could have made a\ncall from the said mobile phone during the imprisonment of the\nfirst accused. There is no material to show that it was they who\nmade the calls during the imprisonment of the first accused.\nEven if it is assumed that the first accused called the petitioners\non his mobile phone during the relevant period, the petitioners\ncannot be said to have committed any offence.\n\n23. For the reasons stated above, I am of the view that the\nlearned Magistrate was not at all justified in issuing process to\nthe petitioners.\n\n24. This case reminds me of the saying that a little\nknowledge is more dangerous than little knowledge. The learned\nMagistrate should have dismissed the complaint in limine. The\ntendency to rush to the court with a complaint by persons who\ndo not have any material with them to support the allegation\nshould be nipped in the bud. Unfortunately, the learned\n\nHia ae i]\nyer\n2019/KER/242\nCrl.M.C. 1236/18 & Conn. Cases -15:-\nMagistrate was more loyal than the king.\nIn the result, these Crl.M.Cs are allowed. The proceedings\nin C.C. No.203 of 2012 on the file of the Additional Chief Judicial\nMagistrate, Thiruvananthapuram are quashed",

He only allowed the\npetitioner to use it when a call came on the phone from a\nreporter of a TV channel. Possession is a relationship between a\nperson and a thing. It shall pass the test of control. Using a\nmobile phone is different from possessing a mobile phone. The\nfacts alleged in the complaint are not sufficient to hold that the\npetitioner was in possession of the mobile phone.\n\n16. I have perused the sworn statement of the second\nrespondent/complainant. His sworn statement is perfunctory in\nnature. Admittedly, he has no direct knowledge about the\npossession of the mobile phone by the petitioner during the\nrelevant period. What is mentioned in the sworn statement is\nthat the second respondent/complainant saw in the media the\npetitioner talking to a news reporter on a mobile phone. This is\nno reason to hold that the latter was in possession of the mobile\nphone at the relevant time. The sworn statement of the second\nrespondent further discloses that in a letter sent by the\nAdditional Director General of Prisons there is a mention that\n\nBeall\nbeens\n2019/KER/242\n\nCrl.M.C. 1236/18 & Conn. Cases ~112:-\ncomplaint had been received that the petitioner used mobile\nphone unauthorisedly in prison. This is not sufficient to hold that\nthe petitioner was in possession of a mobile phone. The other\nrelevant statement in the sworn statement is that the second\nrespondent learnt that the petitioner had called others and\nothers called him during his imprisonment. This also does not\nlead to the conclusion that the petitioner was in possession of a\nmobile phone.\n\n17. Even if it is assumed that the petitioner used the\nmobile phone, it cannot be held that he was in its possession.\nThus, one of the essential elements to attract the offence under\nSection 86(2) of the Act is missing in this case. The learned\nAdditional Chief Judicial Magistrate went wrong in taking\ncognizance of the offence under Section 86(2) of the Act and\nissuing process to the petitioner.\n\nCrl.M.C. Nos.1571 & 1243 of 2018\n\n18. Petitioners in Crl.M.C. No.1571 of 2018 are accused 85\nand 98, and the petitioner in Crl.M.C. No.1243 of 2018 is\naccused No.92 in C.C. No.203 of 2012 on the file of the\nAdditional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Thiruvananthapuram.\n\n19. The complaint of the second respondent shows that\n\n2019/KER/242\n\nCrl.M.C. 1236/18 & Conn. Cases ~113:-\n\nthere are several accused in the case. But only the names of i*\nand 2\"? accused are disclosed. The other accused are shown as\npersons whose involvement will be revealed in the enquiry which\nmay be conducted by the court under Section 202 Cr.P.C. The\nlearned Chief Judicial Magistrate after recording the sworn\nstatement of the second respondent, sent for the details of the\ncalls made from and calls made to the mobile phone\nNo.9447155555, whose subscriber is the first accused (petitioner\nin Crl.M.C. No.1236/2018).\n\n20. The impugned order does not disclose why the\npetitioners in these Crl.M.Cs are made _ accused. The\nendorsement made in the proceedings sheet by the learned\nMagistrate on 6.3.2012, which is the date of the impugned order,\nruns thus: “Incorporate the name and address of the persons\nshown in the memo into the cause title of the complaint.” (sic)\nThis does not make any sense. What can be gathered from the\nrecords of the lower court is that the call details of the mobile\nphone of the first accused collected from the telephone company\nrevealed that there were several incoming and outgoing calls\nduring the relevant period.\n\n21. For the sole reason that neither the complaint nor the\n\nbie\n2019/KER/242\nCrl.M.C. 1236/18 & Conn. Cases ~:14:-\nimpugned order shows the reason for arraigning the petitioners\nas accused, the impugned order is liable to be set aside.\n\n22. Anyone could have made a call to the phone, the\nsubscriber of which was the first accused even though the first\naccused was not in physical possession of the mobile phone. So\nalso any person other than the first accused could have made a\ncall from the said mobile phone during the imprisonment of the\nfirst accused. There is no material to show that it was they who\nmade the calls during the imprisonment of the first accused.\nEven if it is assumed that the first accused called the petitioners\non his mobile phone during the relevant period, the petitioners\ncannot be said to have committed any offence.\n\n23. For the reasons stated above, I am of the view that the\nlearned Magistrate was not at all justified in issuing process to\nthe petitioners.\n\n24. This case reminds me of the saying that a little\nknowledge is more dangerous than little knowledge. The learned\nMagistrate should have dismissed the complaint in limine. The\ntendency to rush to the court with a complaint by persons who\ndo not have any material with them to support the allegation\nshould be nipped in the bud. Unfortunately, the learned\n\nHia ae i]\nyer\n2019/KER/242\nCrl.M.C. 1236/18 & Conn. Cases -15:-\nMagistrate was more loyal than the king.\nIn the result, these Crl.M.Cs are allowed. The proceedings\nin C.C. No.203 of 2012 on the file of the Additional Chief Judicial\nMagistrate, Thiruvananthapuram are quashed so far as the\npetitioners are concerned.\nSd/-\nK.ABRAHAM MATHEW\nJUDGE\nvps\n\n| Ht aes\n2019/KER/242\nCrl.M.C. 1236/18 & Conn.
