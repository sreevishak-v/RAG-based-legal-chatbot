It was alleged by the prosecution that on\n27.3.2010, the petitioners herein, along with the co-\naccused attacked the defacto complainant and others due\nto political enmity. Crime was registered and after\ninvestigation, final report was filed. Cognizance was\ntaken and the matter was pending before the Judicial\nFirst Class Magistrate Court-I, Hosdurg as\nCC.No.1452/2011. All the accused except the petitioners\nherein faced the trial before the court below and were\nacquitted. The case against the petitioners was split up\nand is now pending as CC.No.130/2015 of Judicial First\nClass Magistrate Court-I, Hosdurg.\n\n3. The petitioners have approached this court\n\n2018/KER/47\n\nCrl.M.C.No.8779 of 2017 ;\ncontending that in the light of the acquittal of the co-\naccused on merits, the substratum of the case is broken\nand a successful prosecution of the petitioners herein is\nnot possible. It was also submitted that the disputes\nhave now been resolved. The learned counsel for the\npetitioners invited my attention to paragraph 7 of\nAnnexure-A3 judgment, which discloses that the parties\nhave resolved their dispute. It is stated that PW1\nreferred to a counter case which was also settled between\nthe parties. He turned hostile and did not support the\nprosecution case. PW2 and PW3 who were injured\npersons did not support the prosecution case. Hence it is\nclear that with this quality of evidence, a successful\nprosecution of the petitioners herein is not possible. The\nlearned Public Prosecutor on instructions submitted that\nAnnexure-A3 judgment was not subjected to any appeal\nand the matter has become final.\n\n4. Having considered these facts, I feel that a\nsuccessful prosecution of the petitioners herein is not\n\n2018/KER/47\nCrl.M.C.No.8779 of 2017 3\npossible. Hence Crl.M.C is liable to be allowed.\n\n5. However, it is pertinent to note that though the\ncrime is of the year 2010, the petitioners herein\nremained elusive and did not participate in the judicial\nproceedings. The case against them was split up and\nrefiled. This has caused considerable delay in the judicial\nproceedings. Having considered this, I am inclined to\ninvoke the jurisdiction under section 482 Cr.P.C only\nsubject to payment of cost by each of the petitioner.\nHence Crl.M.C will stand allowed and all further\nproceedings in CC.No.130/2015 of Judicial First Class\nMagistrate Court-I, Hosdurg’ arising from Crime\nNo.169/2010 of Chandera Police Station stand quashed",
