This case is instituted upon the Final Report filed by the Sub Inspector\nof Police, Sreekaryam Police Station in Crime No. 904/2015 for the offences\npunishable under Sections 294(b), 323, 341 and 34 of the IPC of the Indian Penal\nCode, 1860.\n2. The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: Due to the animosity\ntowards the Informant, in attempting to resist the Accused persons volunatarily\ncausing hurt to CWs 2 and 3, in connection with the residence association\nprogramme, the Accused persons in furtherance of their common intention of the\nAccused persons to voluntarily cause hurt to the Informant, on 23.08.2015 at 05:45\nPM, near Jagathi Auditorium at Powdikkonam, uttered obscene words against the\nInformant and the 1*t Accused pushed the Informant from behind. The 2™ Accused\nkicked on the right shoulders of the Informant and caused her to sustain contusion\non her legs on account of her having fallen down. They further assaulted CWs 4\nand 5 who attempted to resist them. Thereby the Accused persons are alleged to\nhave committed the above mentioned offences.\n\n3\n\n3. The cognizance was taken on the basis of Final Report in respect of the\noffences under Sections 323, 325, 354 r/w 34 of the IPC. The ingredients of Section\n294(b) were found to be not made out. On issuance of process, the Accused\nPersons entered appearance before this Court. They were enlarged on bail. They\nwere represented by a Counsel of their own choice. The 2™ Accused was reported\nto be no more and copy of his death certificate also produced. Copies of all\nrelevant Prosecution records were furnished to them. After hearing both parties\nand on perusing relevant records, charge was framed for the offences punishable\nunder Sections 323, 325, 354 r/w 34 of the IPC , 1860 and the same was read over\nand explained to them, to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.\n4. From the side of Prosecution CWs1, 4, 5 and 9 were examined as PWs1 to 4\nrespectively and Exhibits P1 to P3 marked. The presence of CWs 2 and 3 could not\nbe procured by the Prosecution, despite steps having been executed against him.\nThe remaining witnesses were given up by the Learned APP as the material\nwitness, the injured themselves had turned hostile to the case of Prosecution.\nSince no incriminating circumstances arose from the depositions of the witnesses,\nthe examination of the Accused under Section 313(1)(b) of the CrPC was dispensed\nwith. No Defence evidence was also adduced.\n5. Heard both sides and perused the documents. The following points arise for\nconsideration:\n\n(a) Have the Accused persons, in furtherance of their common intention,\n\nvoluntarily caused hurt to PW1 and thereby committed offence punishable\n\nunder Section 323 of the IPC as alleged?\n\n(b) Have the Accused persons, in furtherance of their common intention,\n\nvoluntarily caused grevious hurt to PW1 and thereby committed offence\n\npunishable under Section 325 of the IPC as alleged?\n\n4\n\n(c) Have the Accused persons, in furtherance of their common intention,\n\nassaulted or used criminal force on PW1 and thereby outraged her modesty\n\nunder Section 354 of the IPC as alleged?\n\n(d) If so, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded?\n\n6. Points (a) to (c): These points are considered together for the sake of\nbrevity and for avoiding repetition.\n\nPW1 deposed that had sustained injury in this incident. CWs 2 and 3 are her\nnephews and they also sustained injury in the incident and that she gave Exhibit\nP1 statement to the police regarding the incident. She however denied the Accused\npersons having assaulted her or other witnesses in any manner as alleged. She\nfurther deposed on specific question put forth by the Learned APP that the matters\nhave been settled between the parties and they entered into compromise\nvoluntarily and the Exhibit P2 is the Compromise Petition so filed by her.\n\nPW2 also went against the case of Prosecution and denied having been\nassaulted in the alleged incident. He further denied to have given statement to that\neffect and to the effect that he witnessed other injured having been assaulted as\nwell to the police. PW3 also deposed in the same line.\n\nPW4 is the Investigating Officer and he deposed that he recorded Exhibit P1\nand Exhibit P1(a) body note of the PW1 and that accordingly he registered Exhibit\nP3 FIR.\n\nOn perusal of the evidence led by the Prosecution and the materials on\nrecord, it is clear from the testimony of PW1 and the other witnesses that there is\nno evidence to support the Prosecution case. In fact, PW1 has no case that it was\nthe Accused persons who had allegedly committed the aforesaid offences. The\nother injured and occurrence witnesses also deposed against the version of the\nProsecution. None of the ingredients of the alleged offences are seen to be\nestablished by the Prosecution. There is no whisper that that it was the Accused\n\n5\npersons who had allegedly assaulted the injured witnesses. CWs2 and 3 did not\neven turn up before this Court. In the aforesaid circumstances, the remaining\nwitness was given up by the Prosecution as no purpose would be served in\nexamining him in the above circumstances. Neither the ingredients of the alleged\noffences, nor the involvement of the Accused persons brought out in the evidence\nadduced by the Prosecution. Thus, this Court is of the view that the Prosecution\nhas miserably failed to prove the involvement of this Accused persons in the above\nCrime beyond reasonable doubt. Hence, this Court finds that the Prosecution has\nfailed to prove the case against the Accused and therefore, Points (a) to (c) are\nfound in favour of the Accused.\n7. Point (d): In light of finding in the foregoing points, this point does not\narise for consideration.\n8. In the result, the 1° Accused is found not guilty of having committed the\noffences punishable under Sections 323, 325, 354 r/w 34 IPC. He is acquitted of\nthe aforesaid offences under Section 248(1) of the CrPC. His bail bond stands\ncancelled and he is set at liberty. Since the 2™ Accused is reported to be no more,\nthe charge against him is abated.\n(Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected by\nme and pronounced in open Court on this, the 20\" day of February, 2025.)\nJudicial Magistrate of I Class -I,\nThiruvananthapuram\nAPPENDIX\nA: Prosecution witness\nWhether Eye witness,\n\n6\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nPW1 Jayasree(Cw1) examined on Occurrence witness\n10.02.2020\nPW2 AnilKumar(CW4) examined on Occurrence witness\n22.08.2022\nPW3 Sethunath(cw5) examined on |Occurrence witness\n10.07.2023\nPw4 Shafeek(CW9) examined on\n20.11.2024\nB: Defence witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nC: Court witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA.
