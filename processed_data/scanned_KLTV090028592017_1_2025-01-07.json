He was represented by a Counsel of his own\nchoice. Copies of all relevant prosecution records were furnished to him. The\nparticulars of offence under Sections 279, 337, 338 of the IPC were read over and\nexplained to him, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.\n4. From the side of Prosecution, CWs1, 2 and 3 were examined as PWs 1 to 3\nrespectively and Exhibit Pl was marked. The remaining witnesses were given up\nby the Learned APP as the material witnesses turned hostile to the case of\nProsecution. Since no incriminating circumstances arose from the depositions of\nthe witnesses, the examination of the Accused under Section 313(1)(b) of the CrPC\nwas dispensed with. No Defence evidence was adduced.\n\n3\n5. Heard both sides and perused relevant documents. The following points\narise for consideration.\n\n(a) Has the Accused driven the aforesaid vehicle rashly, negligently and\n\nin a manner endangering the life of PW1, causing injury to him and thereby\n\ncommitted the offence punishable under Section 279 of the IPC as alleged?\n\n(b) Has the Accused driven the aforesaid vehicle and rashly, negligently\n\nin a manner endangering the life and personal safety of PW1, caused hurt to\n\nhim and thereby committed the offence punishable under Section 337 IPC as\nalleged?\n\nCc. Has the Accused by so driving the aforesaid vehicle in the manner\n\naforesaid caused grievous hurt to PW1 and thereby committed the offence\n\npunishable under Section 338 of the IPC as alleged?\n\nd. If so, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded?\n\n6. Points (a) to (c): These points are considered together for the sake of\nbrevity and to avoid repetition.\n\n.  PW1 deposed that She used to work in a shopping complex at\nKesavadasapuram. The accident took place on November 14, 2016, infornt of the\nshopping complex after 04:30 PM. She deposed that while she was crossing the\nroad along with others, one scooter came and hit her leg causing contusion and\nswelling on her right leg. She was taken to the Medical College Hospital in a\npolice vehicle and got admitted there. She sustained three fractures on her leg.\nShe deposed that she gave Exhibit P1 statement to the police. She had not seen the\ndriver of the vehicle or the vehicle number and would not be able to identify the\nAccused.\n\nPW2 deposed that PW1 lives near his House. The accident happened in\nKesavadasapuram. The incident occurred in the year 2017. He doesn’t remember\nthe date of occurrence, but deposed that it occurred about 04:30-05:00 PM. He\n\nA\n\nwas about to board the bus after his job, and witnessed a crowd there and realized\nPW1 got hit by the Activa Scooter. She was taken to hospital. He had not\nwitnessed the incident. He had not seen the driver of the vehicle, number and is\nunable to identify the Accused. He had not seen the Activa Scooter or its driver. He\nhad seen the crowd alone and not the incident. He doesn’t know the reason for the\naccident and would not be not be able to identify the driver of the Scooter. On\nspecific question put forth by the Learned APP, she denied having given statement\nto the police to the effect that the driver of the scooter had driven the same rashly\nand negligently which resulted in the accident.\n\nPW3 deposed he does not know PW1. The accident took place at\nKesavadasapuram junction during 2016. He doesn’t remember the date and time\nof occurrence. Seeing a crowd, he went to check the same and saw that the injured\nbeing taken to the hospital in an auto due to the injury sustained on her leg. He\nfurther deposed that he had seen the crowd alone and not the incident. He doesn’t\nknow the reason for the accident and would not be not be able to identify the\ndriver of the Scooter.\n\nOn going through the evidence and the materials on record, it is pertinent to\nnote that though PWs1 deposed that she sustained injuries pursuant to being hit by\na scooter, she has no case that the same occurred on account of rash or negligent\ndriving at high speed of the Accused himself. She has no idea as to who the alleged\ndriver is or the number of the scooter that had allegedly hit her. PWs 2 and 3, the\noccurrence witnesses also categorically deposed that they do not know the driver\nwho had allegedly driven the scooter or the number of the scooter and has no case\nthat it was the Accused who had so driven the vehicle as alleged by the\nProsecution so as to implicate him. The remaining witnesses were given up by the\nProsecution as the material witnesses, including the injured herself had turned\nhostile to the Prosecution and also no purpose would be served in examining the\nremaining witnesses in the said circumstance. Thus, there is nothing on record as\nrevealed from the deposition of the witnesses so as to implicate the Accused to the\nalleged incident that the Accused by the aforesaid acts committed the above\n\n5\noffences, having caused PW1 sustain injuries. The Prosecution has thus failed to\nsubstantiate its case by adducing proper evidence and thereby failed to prove the\nguilt of the Accused beyond reasonable doubt. Hence these points are found in\nfavour of the Accused.\n7. Point d: In light of analysis of the points hereinabove, since those are found\nin favour of the Accused, no sentence is to be awarded to the Accused.\n8. In the result, the Accused is found not guilty of having committed the\noffence punishable under Sections 279, 337 and 338 of the IPC. Hence, the\nAccused is acquitted of the said offences under section 255(1) of CrPC. His bail\nbond stands canceled and he is set at liberty.\n(Dictated to my Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected by\nme and pronounced in open court on this the 7 day of January, 2025)\nJudicial Magistrate of First Class-I\nThiruvananthapuram\nAPPENDIX\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA: Prosecution witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\n\n6\nPW1 Suja(Cw1) Injured witness\nPW2 Satheesan(CW2) Occurrence Witness\nPW3 Suseelan(CW3) Occurrence witness\nB: Defence witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nNil Nil Nil\nC: Court witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA.
