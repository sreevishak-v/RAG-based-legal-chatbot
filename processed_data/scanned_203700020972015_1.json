TO JUDGE\nWww\n\n2015/KER/17316\nK.RAMAKRISHNAN, J\n\"Dated this the 24\" day of April 2015.\nORDER\n\nThis is an application filed by the petitioner to quash the\norder issuing non-bailable warrant against the petitioner by Judicial\nFirst Class Magistrate's Court-II, Perumbavoor in C.C. No.113 of\n2012, under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure.\n(hereinafter called 'the Code’).\n\n2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioner is an accused\nin C.C. No.113 of 2012 on the files of Judicial First Class\nMagistrate's Court-II, Perumbavoor, which was taken on file on the\nbasis of a private complaint filed by the complainant alleging\noffence under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act. After\ntrial, it ended in conviction and he filed Crl.Appeal No.30 of 2013\n\nrapa\n2015/KER/17316\n\nCri.M.C.2097/2015 2\n\nbefore the Sessions Court, Ernakulam. Later it was transferred to\nAdditional Sessions Court, Muvattupuzha for disposal. He has not\nreceived any information and no notice has been received by the\npetitioner so far. It is now understood that non bailable warrant\nhas been issued by the Magistrate against the petitioner and that is\npending. So the petitioner has no other remedy except to approach\nthis court seeking the following relief:\n\n(i) Stop all the execution proceedings in C.C. No.113/2012\n\nof the honourable Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-II,\n\nPerumbavoor and call for the records which leads to Annexure\n\nAl.\n\n3. On the basis of the allegations in the petition, this court\nhas called for a report from the Judicial First Class Magistrate's\nCourt-II, Perumbavoor on this aspect. The learned Magistrate has\nsent a report, which reads as follows:\n\n“May I humbly submit the following for kind consideration and\nfavourable orders.\nThe complaint was originally filed before the Judicial First\n\n2015/KER/17316\nCri.M.C.2097/2015 3\n\nClass Magistrate's Court-1, Perumbavoor as C.C.No.223/2010 on\n26.3.2010. Subsequently the case was transferred to this court by\nHon'ble CJM and renumbered as C.C.113/2012 on 13.3.2012. The\ncase was disposed on 28.11.2012 by this court. Accused was found\nguilty under section 138 of NI Act, convicted and sentenced to\nundergo simple imprisonment for three months and to pay a\ncompensation of Rs.4,00,000/- (four lakhs only) with interest @9%\nper annum, that would come to Rs.1,05,000/- to the complainant\nw/s.357/- Cr.PC. In default of payment of compensation accused was\nfurther sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for one month.\nSince, the accused was absent on 28.11.2012, he was directed to\nappear before the Court on 28.12.2012 for receiving the sentence.\n\nWhile so, accused filed Crl.A. 30/2013 before the Additional\nDistrict and Sessions Court, Muvattupuzha and the appeal was\ndisposed on 25.7.2014. Judgment in Crl.A.30/13 dated 25.7.2014\nwas received before this Court on 22.11.2014. Vide that order appeal\nwas allowed in part and accused was sentenced to undergo simple\nimprisonment for a day till the rising of Court and to pay a\ncompensation of Rs.4,00,000/- u/s. 357(3) Cr.PC. In default of\npayment of compensation, simple imprisonment for 3 months.\nAccused was directed to appear before this Court within 45 days from\nthe date of appellate judgment. But accused failed to appear before\nthis Court as directed by Hon'ble appellate court and hence, non\nbailable warrant and distress warrant were issued against the accused.\nCase stands posted to 19.5.2015.”\n\n2015/KER/17316\nCrl.M.C.2097/2015 4\n\n4, When the application came up this court for hearing today,\nthe learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that he has already\nfiled a copy application for getting certified copy of the order and\nhe wants to file a revision and since he was not aware of the\ndisposal of the appeal, he could not take further steps in this\nregard. So he wants a breathing time of two weeks for filing a\nrevision and getting appropriate orders from the revisional court.\n\n5. The application is opposed by the learned Public\nProsecutor.\n\n6. Considering nature of reliefs claimed by the petitioner,\nthis court felt that this application can be disposed of hearing the\nlearned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Public\nProsecutor and considering the report of the learned Magistrate.\n\n7. On going through the report of the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate's Court -II, Perumbavoor, it is seen that the Additional\nSessions Court, Muvattupuzha had disposed of the appeal\n\n2015/KER/17316\n\nCrl.M.C.2097/2015 5\n\nconfirming the order of conviction passed by the Judicial First\nClass Magistrate's Court -IJ, Perumbavoor in C.C. No.113 of 2012,\nbut modified the sentence by allowing the appeal in part sentencing\nthe petitioner to undergo imprisonment till rising of the court and\nto pay a compensation of Rs.4,00,000/- to the complainant in\ndefault to undergo simple imprisonment for 3 months, under\nSection 357(3) of the Code, as per order dated 25.7.2014 and 45\ndays time from the date of order of appellate court was granted to\ncomply with the directions. The order was received by the\nMagistrate on 22.11.2014. Since the petitioner did not appear as\ndirected, a non bailable warrant as well as distress warrants have\nbeen issued and now the case is posted to 19.5.2015. On going\nthrough the report, it is seen that there is no illegality committed\nby the court below as the petitioner did not appear as directed by\nthe appellate court to receive the sentence. But however,\nconsidering the pitiable condition of the petitioner that he could\nnot file the revision, since he did not get the information regarding\n\nape\n2015/KER/17316\n\nCri.M.C.2097/2015 6\n\nthe disposal of the case from his counsel, this court feels that some\ntime can be granted to the petitioner to file the revision. So, two\nweeks' time from today is granted to the petitioner to file revision\nand to get necessary interim orders from the revisional court. Till\nthen the coercive steps initiated by the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate's Court-II, Perumbavoor is directed to be kept in\nabeyance. If no interim order has been produced by the petitioner\nwithin that time, the court below is at liberty to proceed with the\ncoercive steps already initiated against the petitioner.\n\nWith the above observations and directions, this Crl.M.C. is\ndisposed of. The office is directed to communicate this order to\nthe concerned court immediately.\n\nSd/-\nK.RAMAKRISHNAN, J,\nJUDGE\ndl\n\n"
