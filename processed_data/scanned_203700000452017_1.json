TO JUDGE\nR.AV\n\nBevan\n2017/KER/229\nSUNIL THOMAS, J.\n~—CrLM.C.No.45 of 2017\nDated this the 4” day of January, 2017\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner herein is the sole accused in Crime\nNo.27/14 of Puthencruz Police Station for offences\npunishable under Sections 324 and 326 of the Indian\nPenal Code. After investigation final report was laid and\nthe matter is pending as CC.No.1504/2014 of Judicial\nFirst Class Magistrate Court, Kolencherry.\n\n2. The petitioner submits that the warrant was\nissued by the court below at the first instance itself.\nAccording to the petitioner herein, he was employed and\nwas regularly attending the office. He never absconded\nand he never had any intention to keep away from the\njurisdiction of the court below. The petitioner now\nsubmits that he is ready and willing to appear before the\ncourt below and participate in the trial. However his only\napprehension is that in the event of his surrender before\n\nBevan\n2017/KER/229\nCrl.M.C.No.45 of 2017 2\nthe court below, the court below is not likely to take up\nhis bail application on the same day and there is a\npossibility that he will be remanded.\n\n3. Notice was given to the learned Public\nProsecutor and heard the learned counsel for the\npetitioner.\n\n4. The offences alleged against the petitioner are\nunder Sections 324 and 326 of the Indian Penal Code. It\nseems that the final report was laid some time in 2014\nand the matter has been pending since then. In the light\nof the submission of the petitioner that he is ready and\nwilling to participate in the proceedings, virtually the\npurpose of issuing the summons stand served. Hence I\nfeel that relief can be granted to the petitioner herein.\n\nHence this Crl.M.C is disposed of with a direction\nthat in the event of the petitioner herein appearing before\nthe court below within ten days from today and\nsubmitting himself to the jurisdiction, his bail application\nmay be considered by the court below on the same day,\nhaving regard to the above said facts. The warrant issued\n\nPearl\nfap aeie as\n2017/KER/229\nCrl.M.C.No.45 of 2017 3\nby the court below will be kept in abeyance during the\nabove ten days period.\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE\n\nR.AV\n\n"
