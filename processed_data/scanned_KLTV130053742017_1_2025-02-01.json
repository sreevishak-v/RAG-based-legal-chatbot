Accused Nos. 2 to 6 were called upon to\nadduce evidence but no defence evidence was adduced from the side of the\naccused Nos. 2 to 6.\n\n6. Heard both sides.\n\n7. Points that arose for consideration are as follows:-\n\n1. Whether, Accused No.1 evicted CW1 Soudamini from their house\nMankulathu Veedu , near Alancherry Junction, Arasumoodu, Attipra\nWard, Attipra Village after obtaining property from her and the accused\nNos.2 to 6 who are legally bound to protect the welfare of CW1\nneglected to take care of CW1 refused to give her shelter and care and\nthereby committed offence punishable under section 24 of Maintenance\nand Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act ?\n\n2. If the accused Nos. 2 to 6 are found guilty? What is the order of the\nsentence?\n\n5 OF 8\n\n8. Point No. 1 :-To avoid repetition and for brevity, points No.1 is considered\ntogether. Prosecution case is that the accused have committed an offence\npunishable under section 24 of Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior\nCitizens Act.\n\n9. Evidence adduced by the prosecution : PW1 Harikumar deposed thatCW1\nSoudamini is not acquainted to him, he further denied the statement before the\npolice .\n\n10.PW2, Chandran. L was the Sub Inspector of police during the year 2014 .-He\ndeposed that he had conducted the investigation of the above case and Ext P1\nreport as to he identity of the accused persons has been filed by him .He\nfurther deposed that the accused no.1 was released on bail asper the EXt P2 bai\nbond .He identified the signature of CW4 in the Ext P3 FIS and Ext\nP4FIR ,after due investigation, he filed final report before the court.\n\n11.Submissions made by the learned counsel for the accused persons : The\nlearned counsels for the accused nos. 2 to 6 submitted that the accused persons\nare innocent and there is no evidence to prove the allegation .\n\n6 Of 8\n12.Submission made by the learned APP : The learned APP submitted that the\naccused persons were neglected to take care of CW1 and the prosecution\nevidence is sufficient to prove their guilt .\n13.Evaluation of the evidence : Section 24 of Maintenance and Welfare of\nParents and Senior Citizens Act provides as follows:\nExposure and abandonment of senior citizen —Whoever, having the care or\nprotection of senior citizen leaves, such senior citizen in any place with the\nintention of wholly abandoning such senior citizen, shall be punishable with\nimprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three\nmonths or fine which may extend to five thousands rupees or with both .\n14.In Pramod John v. State of Kearla, 2024 (4) KHC 557, Honourable Apex\nCourt observed that It is evident that, “the offence arises when a senior citizen\nor a parent is abandoned wholly by a person who is bound to take care of the\nsenior citizen/parent and it was further observed that the term ‘abandoning’\nrequires total neglect. The said term when prefixed by the word ‘wholly’\nindicates absolute and complete abandonment. The word ‘wholly’ is explained\nin P Ramanatha Aiyer’s Law Lexicon 4th Edition as “entirely, completely, fully,\ntotally and in every respect”. Thus unless there is a total and complete\nabandonment of the parent by leaving him in a place without any arrangement\n\n7 OF8\n\nfor taking care of the senior citizen, the offence cannot be said to have been\ncommitted. The transportation of a parent between the children could be for\nvarious purposes and even based on an understanding arrived at either\nbetween the children or between the parent and the child”.\n\n15.In order to hold the accused persons liable for the offence u/s. 24 of\nMaintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, the prosecution\nhas to prove that the accused persons who are duty bound to look after CW1\nSoudamini Devi Amma willfully neglected to take care of her and abandoned\nher. But coming to the present facts, the evidence of PW1 and PW2 is not\nsufficient to prove that CW1 was abandoned by the accused persons.\nMoreover,PW1 did not support the case of prosecution. Hence there is no\ndirect or any circumstantial evidence to show that CW1, Soudamini Devi\nAmma was abandoned by the accused persons.\n\n16.On considering the evidence of PW1 and PW2, it can be seen that there is\nnothing on record to disclose that the accused have committed the offences as\nalleged by the prosecution. Having considered the evidence on record, this\ncourt is of the view that the prosecution has failed to prove the guilt of the\naccused persons and for the said reasons, point No.1 found against the\nprosecution.\n\n8 OF 8\n17.Point No. 2 :- Upon the finding in point No.1, the Accused Nos. 2 to 6 are\nfound not guilty of offence punishable under section 24 of Maintenance and\nWelfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act and they are acquitted of the said\noffences under section 255(1) Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.\nAccused No.1 is reported no more. Hence charge against her is abated.\nNo material objects produced in this case.\nDictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected by me\nand pronounced in the open court on this the 1“ day of February, 2025.\nSd/-\nJudicial I Class Magistrate-V,\nThiruvananthapuram.\nAPPENDIX\nFORM 62\nList of Prosecution/Defence /Court Witnesses\n(Rule 134 Criminal Rules of Practice, Kerala)\nWhether Eye witness, Police witness,\nRank | Name Expert witness, Medical witness,\nOther witness\nL.
