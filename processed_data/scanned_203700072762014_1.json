    "outcome": "ORDER\nThe petitioners herein are the two accused in S.C. No.\n394/2014 of the Court of Sessions, Ernakulam, now pending\nbefore the learned Principal Assistant Sessions Judge,\nErnakulam. The incident of assault alleged in this case\nhappened in connection with some dispute regarding the\nrunning time of two private buses. The Ernakulam Town North\nPolice Registered the Crime under Sections 341 & 308 read\nwith Section 34 of IPC on the complaint of one Shemim who\nsustained injuries in the alleged incident. He is the second\nrespondent herein. The petitioners now seek orders quashing\nthe prosecution on the ground that they and the said Shemim\nhave come to terms amicably out of Court, and the whole\ndispute, which led to the unfortunate incident stands, resolved\nfor ever. The de facto complainant Shemim has filed affidavit\nto the effect that the whole dispute stands resolved and he has\n\nae\n\n2015/KER/247\nCrl.M.C. No.7276 of 2014 22:\nno complaint or grievance. On a perusal of the prosecution\nrecords including the wound certificate, I find that there is\nabsolutely nothing to attract Section 308 of IPC and that the\nsaid section was incorporated on the basis of a purely\nhypothetical statement. Anyway, the parties have come to\nterms amicably and the de facto complainant has no grievance\nor complaint now. In such a situation, continuance of the\nprosecution will not serve any purpose other than wasting the\nprecise time of the trial court, because there is no material to\nsupport the prosecution, if the case goes to trial.\n\nIn the result, the Crl.M.C. is allowed. The prosecution\nagainst the petitioners in S.C. No.394/2014 of the Court of\nSessions , Ernakulam, will stand quashed",
