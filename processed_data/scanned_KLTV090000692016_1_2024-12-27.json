This case arose on the Final Report filed by the Sub Inspector of Police,\nKaramana in Crime No. 99/2010 for the offences under sections 447, 324, 326 and\n427 of the Indian Penal Code. The sole Accused herein is the brother-in-law of the\nInformant’s husband.\n2. The Prosecution allegation is that on 17.02.2010 around 05:00 PM in the\nhouse of the Informant at Pangappara; the Accused, due to the animosity towards\nInformant and her husband for having rejected his request to return the property\nthey had bought from him few years back; criminally trespassed into her house and\nthrew brick pieces from his possession repeatedly at the Informant and thereby\nshe sustained contusion and swelling on her left eye, left elbow, right thumb. When\nshe tried to escape, the Accused hit her left hand with a shovel handle lying\nthereon, thereby resulting in fracture to her bone in the left wrist. She also\nsustained loss to the tune of an amount of Rs. 3100/- (Rupees Three Thousand One\nHundred Only) as her left earring was broken and thereby committed the offences\npunishable under Sections 447, 324, 326 and 427 of the Indian Penal Code\n(hereinafter referred to as the ‘IPC’).\n3. On the basis of the final report, cognizance was taken in respect of the\noffences punishable under the aforesaid Sections. On issuance of process, the\n\n3\nAccused entered appearance. After preliminary hearing, charge was framed for the\noffences under Sections 447, 324, 326 and 427 of the IPC. It was read over and\nexplained to the Accused to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.\n4. From the side of Prosecution, CWs 1, 2, 3, 7 to 9 and an additional witness\n(as per Order in C.M.P. No. 3102/2024) were examined as PWs 1 to 7 respectively\nand Exhibits P1, Pi(a), P2 to P6 were marked. CW5 was given up by the Learned\nAPP on report that his presence cannot be secured as he is bedridden due to old\nage. Pursuant to closure of evidence of the Prosecution, the Accused was examined\nunder Section 313(1)(b) of the CrPC wherein he denied all the incriminating\ncircumstances adduced against him by the Prosecution. No Defence evidence was\nadduced by the Accused.\n5, Heard both sides. The following points arise for consideration:\n(a) Has the Accused voluntarily caused hurt to PW1 by throwing brick pieces on her\nand thereby committed the offence punishable under Section 324 of the IPC?\n(b) Has the Accused voluntarily caused grievous hurt to PW1 by hitting her with\nshovel handle causing fracture to the bone in her left wrist punishable under\nSection 326 of the IPC?\n(c) Has the Accused by criminally trespassed into the house of the Informant and\nthereby committed the offences punishable under Sections 447 of the IPC?\n(d) Has the Accused committed the offence of mischief and thereby committed the\noffences punishable under Sections 427 of the IPC?\n\n4\nIf so, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded?\n6. Point (a) and (b): These points are considered together for the sake of\nbrevity and for avoiding repetition.\n\nThe injured was examined as PW1 and her FIS marked as Exhibit P1. To\nprove the incident, CWs 2 and 3, the occurrence witnesses were examined as PWs\n2 and 3. CW7 examined as PW4 is the Sub Inspector of the Police who had\nrecorded Exhibit P1 statement of the PW1 and Exhibit P2(a) body note and on the\nbasis of which, registered Exhibit P2 FIR. CW8, examined as PW5 is the\nInvestigating Officer who had prepared Exhibit P3 Scene Mahazar. He seized MOs\nMO1 and MO2 brick pieces (two in Nos) and MO3 shovel handle respectively,\nwhich were included in Exhibit P4 KPF 151 A Form. He further prepared Exhibit\nP5, the Address Memo reflecting the details of the Accused and Exhibit P5 is the\nreport to the effect rectifying the mistake crept in Exhibit P2 FIR that right wrist\nbone of PW1 got fractured. The Wound Certificate was initially marked as Exhibit\nP6 through CW9, examined as PW6 who had taken over Investigation from PW5.\nSince it was reported from the side of Prosecution that the presence of CW6, the\ndoctor who had examined PW1 could not be procured as his details were\nunavailable, the Superintendent, General Hospital Trivandrum was examined as\nPW7 for the purpose of proving the Exhibit P6 Wound Certificate as per Order in\nC.M.P. No. 3126/2024. But the same was only identified by him and continued to\nremain marked as Exhibit P6.\n\n5\n\n6.1. PW1 deposed that the incident occurred on 17.02.2012 at her home at\nKaryavattom at about 04:30 - 05:00 PM. She was having food inside her house and\nhearing hue and cry from outside, she got out of her house and found the Accused\nthere and he threw brick piece at her. He also broke and destroyed the utensils\nkept outside the house for feeding the cattle. Thereafter he hit her on her left hand\nwith a shovel handle causing fracture. She called the police. The Accused was not\nletting her to go outside and was standing there. The police came and took her to\nMedical College wherein she was admitted and her left hand got fractured. She\nalso sustained injuries on her head, eye and leg and she went to the eye hospital\nthe next day for treatment. She also sustained loss of an amount of Rs. 15,000/-\n(Rupees Fifteen Thousand Only) on account of the Accused having broken her\nchain weighing one sovereign of gold and also her left earring. She deposed that\nthe Accused is the brother-in-law of her husband and she got married and resided\nin the matrimonial house nearly for five months and where the Accused also lived\nwith his family. She was told that the house was in the name of her husband. She\nwent to her own house due to the annoyance of the Accused and his family and\nreturned to the said home only in 1994 when her husband returned from the Gulf\nand thereafter due to quarrel, the Accused and his family left from the said home.\nWhen the Accused demanded the property to be returned, they refused the same\nbeing the reason to attack her. She deposed that she gave Exhibit P1 Statement to\nthe police and that she could identify the brick piece and shovel handle with which\nshe was attacked. Thereafter, she identified the MO1 & MO2 brick pieces.\n\n6\n\nPW2, deposed that PW1 is her sister-in-law. The incident occurred on\n17.02.2010 about 05:00 PM at Karyavattom in front of PW1’s house. PW1 was\nsitting inside her house along with PWs2 and PW3, the wife of PW2 and sister of\nPW1, and with another lady residing upstairs. The Accused came with a hue and\ncry and threw two brick pieces at PW1, due to which she sustained injury on her\nleft eye, left elbow and right thumb. The Accuse ran and got into the cattle shed\nand took the shovel handle kept therein and hit PW1 on her left hand causing her\nfracture. He took PW1 to the Medical College Hospital. He is aware of the property\ndispute between PW1 and the Accused and it is on account of the said animosity,\nthat he had so assaulted her. He identified MOs 1 and 2 as the brick pieces alleged\nto have been thrown at PW1 and further identified MO3 shovel handle as the one\nthat has been allegedly used for hitting PW1.\n\nPW3, is the sister of PW1 and wife of PW2. She deposed that the incident on\n17.02.2010 about 05:00 PM in front of PW1’s house. She knows the Accused who is\nthe relative of PW1. She along with PW2 had gone to PW1’s house in their car.\nPW2 is a driver by profession. They were sitting inside PW1’s home. Hearing sound\nfrom outside, they went out and saw the Accused and he threw stone at PW1. It\nwas a brick and as a result, PW1 sustained injury on her left eye, abrasion on her\nright-hand little finger. PW1 was hit on her left elbow with a shovel handle which\nwas lying in the cattle shed. PW1 felt pain. Twice the Accused threw brick at PW1.\nPWI1 was taken to the Medical College and it was informed that she sustained\nfracture on her left hand. She deposed that she could identify the brick piece and\n\n7\nalso the shovel handle. She identified MO 1 as the brick piece. She described that\none side of said shovel handle was slightly slanted and one side broken and\nidentified MO3 shovel handle as the one that has been allegedly used for hitting\nPW1.\n\nPW4, deposed that, on 18.02.2010, he had recorded Exhibit P1 statement of\nthe PW1 and Exhibit P2(a) body note and on the basis of which, he registered\nExhibit P2 FIR. PW5, the Investigating Officer deposed that he inspected the scene\nof occurrence and prepared Exhibit P3 Scene Mahazar. He seized MO1 and MO2\nbrick pieces (two in Nos) and MO3 shovel handle respectively, in the presence of\nPW3 which were included in Exhibit P4 KPF 151 A Form. He further prepared\nExhibit P5, the Address Memo reflecting the details of the Accused and Exhibit P5\nis the report to the effect rectifying the mistake crept in Exhibit P2 FIR that right\nwrist bone of PW1 got fractured. He deposed that he could identify the brick piece\nand also the shovel handle so seized and produced by him. He identified MO1 and\n2 as the brick pieces and identified MO3 shovel handle as the one that has been\nallegedly used for hitting PW1. PW6, deposed that he had took over Investigation\nfrom PW5 on 05.01.2012, produced the Exhibit P6 Wound Certificate before the\nCourt, completed the Investigation and filed the Final Report before this Court.\n\nPW7, the Superintendent of Medical College Trivandrum, deposed that\nExhibit P6 is the Wound Certificate issued by CW5 and the signature therein\nbelongs to CW6. The paper is that issued from the Medical College. The present\ndetails of CW5 are not available as per records in the Medical College. CW6 has\n\n8\n\nnot worked with him and that he doesn’t know his handwriting or signature.\nHowever, the same is seen in the duty register maintained there and further the\nduplicate of Exhibit P6 also is available there. He further deposed as to the\ncontents of Exhibit P6 that PW1 was examined on 17.02.2010 at 06:45 PM noting\nfracture on the bone on left forearm and further swelling and contusion note in the\nsaid portion. Darkening below the left eye-lid also noted. The alleged history of\nassault as recorded is to the effect that it is by a known person with stone, namely\nshivankutty nair at 05:00 PM. PW7 further deposed that as per his personal\nopinion, fracture and swelling can occur if assaulted by a stone.\n\n6.2. The Learned APP points out that as regards the alleged offences, PW1, the\ninjured herself has categorically deposed in tune with the prosecution case. She\nhas specifically deposed as to the overt acts committed by the Accused and the\ninjuries sustained to her as a result of the said alleged overt acts. Her case is\ncorroborated and substantiated further by the occurrence witness who are PWs 2\nand 3, who have very well witnessed the incident, Exhibit P(1)(a) body note and\nfurther by the medical evidence, that is, Exhibit P6 Wound Certificate. The MOs\nhave been recovered from the place of occurrence as reflected from Exhibit P3\nScene Mahazar and as per the deposition of PW5, the Investigating Officer and\nthey have been identified by the witnesses respectively. There is nothing put\nforward in the cross-examination of these witnesses so as to discredit their\nevidence.\n\n9\n\nThe Learned Counsel for the Accused, on the other hand, assails the case of\nthe Prosecution on the following grounds: (i) inconsistency in the deposition of\nPW1 pertaining to the alleged incident questioning the believability of the said\nevidence; (ii) occurrence witnesses, PWs 2 and 3 are interested witnesses and their\nversion as regards the incident and that of PW1 are inconsistent in itself, making\ntheir presence at the scene of occurrence doubtful and questionable; (iii) there is\nno medical evidence in this case as Exhibit P6, Wound Certificate cannot be relied\non as the same is not proved, (iv) delay in registration of the FIR is not explained,\n(v) there is no proper identification of the MOs. The said anomalies would throw\nserious doubt on the case of the Prosecution.\n\nSubstantiating the same, the Learned Counsel for the Accused submits that\non examination of PW1, she deposed that while she was at her home having food,\nshe allegedly heard a hue and cry and she went outside her home, at which\njuncture, saw the Accused there to have thrown brick piece at her, wherein\nsustained injuries on her head, eye and leg. He hit her on her left hand with a\nshovel handle causing fracture. She called the police. The Accused was not letting\nher to go outside and was standing there. She has identified MOs 1 and 2 as the\nbrick pieces by which she got allegedly hit. She has not identified the shovel\nhandle by which she has allegedly been attacked. The same is seen identified by\nPWs 2, 3 and PW5. Coming to the evidence of PWs 2 and 3, the Learned Counsel\nfor the Accused would argue that they are interested witnesses. The reason being\nthat during cross-examination of PW1, she categorically deposed that she was\n\n10\nalone in the house when the incident happened and that she doesn’t know if\nsomeone had gathered there, and that the place is less inhabited; which in itself\nquestions the presence of PWs 2 and 3 at the alleged scene of occurrence. The\nversion of PWs 2 and 3 is that they along with PW1 were sitting inside the house of\nPW1 at which instance the alleged incident occurred, they heard the sound and\nwent outside and saw the Accused to have allegedly attacked PW1. PW2 in fact,\nwent on deposing that CW4 was also with them at the relevant time; which is not\neven a case for PW1. PW3 also stated the presence of police in the alleged scene of\noccurrence on the alleged date and that PW1 was hit twice by brick piece. The\nidentification of MOs 1, 2 and MO3 by PWs 2 and 3 would in the said backdrop\ncannot be relied upon, according to the Accused. Furthermore, the Learned\nCounsel for the Accused also points out that Exhibit P3 Scene Mahazar reflected\npresence of broken pieces of brick spread nearby the alleged scene of occurrence\nand the shovel handle with specific description. PW5, when cross-examined\nadmitted the existence of broken pieces of brick and further that it was PW3 who\nhad shown him the same and identified the same. Further he admits that Mos\nwere not scientifically examined and that the Mos were in prosecuiton of\nAccused at the time of incident as per statement of Pws 1 to 3. The recovery of\nalleged weapons by the Investigating Officer is therefore based on the\nidentification of the alleged weapon of offence is by PW3, who according to PW1\nwas not even there at the scene of occurrence. Hence the same cannot also be\nrelied upon. During the cross examination, PW1 admitted her relation with PWs2\nand 3 to be her brother-in-law and sister and that PW3 was there with her in the\n\n11\n\nhospital. The Learned Counsel for the Accused would argue that she deposed in\nher examination-in-chief that she had called the police and that the police came\nthere and took her to the hospital. Her allegations in the FIS however, shows that\nshe was taken to the hospital by PWs 2 and 3, which is also the case of PWs 2 and\n3 and when questioned to by the Accused in cross, she admitted the same to have\nbeen stated in her previous statement, which in fact is not true. She further\ndeposed in her cross-examination that she met the doctor and PWs 2, 3 and CW4\nwere the ones with her. Thus, the statements of the witnesses are inconsistent in\nitself as well as with each other on material facts of corroboration. All these would\nhighly tilt to the fact that PWs 2 and 3, the alleged occurrence witnesses are in fact\nonly interested witnesses as the natural possibility of their presence at the scene of\noccurrence itself is made questionable and doubtful.\n\nThere is a delay of one day in registration of the crime. PW1 deposed that\nthe police were very well present in the scene of occurrence and had in fact taken\nher to the hospital. PW3 also affirmed the presence of police officials. There is no\ncase that the police received any intimation from the hospital. The reason for the\ndelay is not explained in the FIR and as per PW4 and PWS5, there is no delay in\nregistering the crime.\n\nAs regards the medical evidence, Exhibit P6 and deposition of PW7, the\nLearned Counsel for the Accused points out that the same cannot be relied upon,\nas the same has not been proved and therefore not admissible in evidence and\nrelied on Kochu v. State of Kerala, 1978 KHC 321. PW7 is neither the doctor\n\n12\n\nwho had allegedly examined PW1 nor is he acquainted with the handwriting or\nsignature of the CW6, who had in fact examined her. Even otherwise, if Exhibit P6\nis taken into account, the Learned Counsel points out that the alleged history of\nassault is by means of ‘stone’ alone and the person who is stated to have brought\nthe patient is her husband Mr. Manoharan Nair. Thus, the shovel handle is\nnowhere in the picture. Nor is her husband. PW1 herself has no case that her\nhusband was with her and according to her PWs 2, 3 and CW4 was with her. PWs 2\nand 3 also deposed to the effect that they had taken them to the hospital. He\nfurther points put that there is no consistency for PW1 as regards the injuries\nsustained. In the dock, the injuries stated to have been sustained by her is on her\nhead, eye and leg. She has no case that the fracture to her left wrist bone was\ncaused by means of MOs 1 and 2. MO3 is not identified by her and the\nidentification of MO3 by PWs2 and 3 cannot be relied upon. Further PW1 has no\ncase that MOs 1 and 2 were thrown at her repeatedly. She has no case that she felt\nany pain, bodily disease or infirmity as a result of the alleged act. The wound\ncertificate is not proved. Hence the ingredients of the offences under Sections 324\nand 326 is not made out in the present case and the Prosecution could not\nsubstantiate its case beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nPer contra, the Learned APP points out that only those discrepancies in the\nevidence of the witnesses that are so materially incompatible with the credibility of\ntheir version, that would make their evidence not believable and not otherwise.\nMerely for the reason that PWs 2 and 3 were her close relatives would not make\n\n13\n\nthem interested witnesses, unless there is any cogent evidence, their evidence\nneed not be discarded. The general opinion given by PW7 that fracture and\nswelling can occur if assaulted by a stone can be taken into consideration. The\ndelay of one day is not fatal to the case of Prosecution, as the cause for the delay in\nconnection with the facts and circumstances of this case is not attributable to any\neffort to concoct a version. This is so, even if, for arguments’ sake it is accepted\nthat the police were available at the place of occurrence as the injured was taken\nto the hospital and she was admitted there. The statement of the injured witness is\nof a high evidentiary value and her version cannot be discarded lightly unless there\nexist compelling circumstances and the injured witness in this case has clearly and\ncategorically deposed as to the overt act, identified the Accused and injuries\nsustained by her. The Learned APP relies on Chandrapurath Rajeevan, S/o\nAchuthan v. State of Kerala, 2024 (2) KLD 110; Kurian v. State, 2019 (4)\nKLJ 903 to substantiate her contentions.\n\n6.3. This Court has carefully gone through the materials on record and\nconsidered the contentions placed by the Learned APP and the Learned Counsel\nfor the Accused. It is settled that for a successful prosecution on the ground of\ninfliction of hurt and grievous hurt, under Sections 324 and 326IPC, the\nprosecution must have a definite case that the alleged hurt and grievous hurt was\ncaused or inflicted by various means as provided in the said Sections. In the case\nat hand, the Prosecution allegation is that by means of MOs 1 and 2 (brick piece),\nthe Accused voluntary caused hurt to PW1 causing her to sustain swelling and\n\n14\ncontusion on her left eye, left elbow, right thumb; and further that by means of\nshovel handle, the Accused voluntarily caused grievous hurt to her resulting in her\nleft wrist bone fractured.\n\nOn appreciation of the evidence of Prosecution Witnesses, this Court finds\nconsiderable force in the argument of the Learned Counsel for the Accused as\nregards believability of the evidence of PWs 2 and 3. It is true as rightly pointed\nout by the Learned APP that merely for the reason that they are close relatives of\nPW1, their evidence cannot be discarded. However, it is pertinent to note that in\nthe present case PW1 herself has got no case that they were present at the time of\nthe alleged incident. The statement made by her during her cross-examination that\nshe alone was present in her house at the time of the alleged incident by necessary\nimplication rules out the possibility of presence of the PWs 2 and 3 therein and the\nsame cuts to the root of the very basis of the version of PWs 2 and 3 as regards\ntheir presence in the house of PW1 and thereby to have witnessed the alleged\nincident, further leading to the identification of MOs in this case as well. The\nadmission of PW1 as to her presence alone, definitely is a material circumstance,\nleading inference as to the interestedness of the occurrence witness, ruling out the\npossibility of their presence naturally and consequentially questioning the\nbelievability of their depositions.\n\nComing to the evidence of PW1, it is true that there is inconsistency in her\ndeposition as regards the presence of police officials and the fact of her having\nbeen taken to the hospital by the police, while she admits in her cross-examination\n\n15\n\nthat PWs 2, 3 and CW4 were with her in the hospital. It is on the said premise that\nthe question of delay in registering the crime was raised. Mere delay in all\ncircumstances would not be fatal to the Prosecution. The cause of delay that could\nbe gathered from the materials on record is that she was taken to the hospital,\nadmitted therein and on the very next day she gave Exhibit P1 Statement. True\nthat the Wound Certificate is challenged, even then, it cannot amount to delay so\nfatal to the case of prosecution. Further, the inconsistency as regards the presence\nof the police officials cannot be relied on as though question was put as to PW1\nduring her cross-examination whether the same was stated in her previous\nstatement to which she answered in the affirmative; but no opportunity granted to\nexplain as to why the same is not seen reflected in her previous statement. Hence,\nthis Court is unable to accept the contention of the Learned Counsel for the\nAccused in the said regard.\n\nIt is true that the deposition of an injured witness is on a high footing and\ncannot be discarded lightly unless there are compelling circumstances and the\nevidence has to be read as a whole. The inconsistency in the evidence of PW1 as\nregards her having been taken to the hospital by the police officials, and her\nstatement during the cross-examination that PWs 2, 3 and CW4 were with her in\nthe hospital and CW4 had come to take her to the hospital; her admission that she\nalone was present at the alleged scene of occurrence; and her statement as\nregards the injuries sustained alone cannot lead to complete discarding of her\nevidence, but is something that would defenetely there is no doubt in her case.\n\n16\nHere, pertaining to the offence punishable under Section 326 of the IPC, the\nalleged weapon of offence, that is, the shovel handle is not identified by the injured\nwitness. The same is seen to have been identified by PWs 2 and 3; whose presence\nitself has become questionable for the reason cited supra, leading inference of\nthem being interested witness. The recovery of alleged weapon by PW5, according\nto him is on the basis of identification by PW3, who according to PW1 was not even\nthere at the scene of occurrence. Neither PW1 nor W5 has got a case that the said\nshovel handle was identified by PW1. Exhibit P6 though marked, it is not proved.\nEven if the doctor who has examined the injured is not available for the\ncircumstances mentioned in Section 32 of the Indian Evidence Act, the certificate\nissued by him would still be relevant and admissible, provided the mode of proof as\ncontemplated under Section 67 read with Section 47 of Indian Evidence Act is also\ncomplied with. PW7 has no acquaintance with the handwriting or signature of the\nCW6, who had in fact examined him and whose presence could not be procurred by\nprosecuiton. Hence as rightly argued by the Learned Counsel for the Accused, the\nWound Certificate cannot be relied on. This Court is also unable to accept the\ncontention of the Learned APP that PW7, being a doctor, his general opinion can\nbe taken into account as to the cause of injury. Here, the general opinion of PW7 is\nto the effect that these injuries including the fracture could be caused by means of\na ‘stone’ and not by shovel handle. Neither PW1 nor Prosecution has got a case\nthat the fracture was caused by a stone, much less by MOs 1 and 2. Had it been\nthe case, even then, necessary materials ought to have been elicited from the\ndoctor who has examined PW1 as regards the possibility of death that would have\n\n17\nbeen caused due to the alleged grievous injury, inflicted by use of stone or MOs 1\nand 2, as weapon of offence; and in case of unavailability of the said doctor, from\nanother doctor familiar with the former’s handwriting or signature which\nadmittedly is not the case here. Hence, this Court is of the view that the\nProsecution has not been able to prove that the Accused has committed the offence\npunishable under Section 326 of the IPC beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nPertaining to the offence punishable under Section 324 of the IPC, as per the\nProsecution case, the brick pieces were thrown at PW1 repeatedly and the injuries\nsustained are swelling and contusion on left eye, left elbow, right thumb. PW1 has\nno case that she sustained said injuries by means of MOs 1 and 2 on her left elbow\nor right thumb. According to her the injuries sustained are on her head, eye and\nleg. During her cross examination, it was put to her as to whether she had given\nstatement as injuries sustained on her leg, to which she answered in the\naffirmative and further deposed that she has no explanation to offer, if the same is\nnot so reflected in Exhibit P1. There is no supporting medical evidence before this\nCourt to corroborate the injuries alleged for the reason cited supra. The recovery\nof MOs 1 and 2 by PW5 is based on the identification of the alleged weapon of\noffence is by PW3, which cannot be relied upon. Although PW1 identified MOs 1\nand 2 and deposed the injuries sustained by her, which is of course different from\nthat of the Prosecution case; the essential ingredient that the ‘hurt’ was caused to\nher by the alleged act is not established herein, specifically for the reason that\nPWI1 has no case that by the injuries so deposed to have been sustained by her she\n\n18\n\nsuffered any pain, bodily disease or infirmity (See Padmakumar v. State of\nKerala, 2024 KER 8129). This is more so, when the medical evidence is not\nproved. Hence, even if her evidence is taken on face value as regards the said\noffence, for the aforesaid reasons; this Court finds that Prosecution has failed to\nsubstantiate and prove its case that ingredients of offence punishable under\nSection 324 IPC is attracted. These points are therefore answered in favour of the\nAccused.\n\n7. Point (c) and (d): These points are considered together for the sake of\nbrevity and for avoiding repetition.\n\nAs regards the offence of mischief, it is the case of Prosecution that her left\nearring was broken. In the dock, she deposed that her chain worth one sovereign\nof gold and her earring were allegedly hit and broken by the Accused. Further,\nPW1 deposed before the Court that the utensils kept outside the house for feeding\nthe cattle were broken by the Accused. During the cross-examination, she admitted\nto have stated the same to the police but to the specific suggestion put to her as\nregards absence of the same seen reflected in Exhibit P1, she had no explanation\nto offer except that she has no idea about the same. Thus, it is evident that she had\nno such case, except for the earring. Further the earring was stated to have been\nbroken in the alleged incident and not on account of Accused having hit and\ndestroyed the same as seen deposed in the dock. It is pertinent to note that no\novert act on the person of PW1 as would result in the Accused to hit and destroy\nthe earring is seen alleged at all. The loss alleged is to the tune of Rs. 15,000.\n\n19\nMoreover, there is no evidence forthcoming from the side of Prosecution as\nregards amount alleged to have been lost or to that of the basic ingredients of the\noffence of mischief punishable under Section 427 of the IPC.\n\nPertaining to the offence alleged under Section 447 of the IPC, it is essential\nthat the alleged trespass by the offender must be with an intention to commit any\noffence, or to intimidate, insult or annoy any person in possession of such property.\nThis Court is unable to accept the contention of the Learned Counsel for the\nAccused that there is cloud over the scene of occurrence as PW1 is seen to have\ndeposed that the Accused was not letting her to go out, but there is no specific\nmention as to where she was standing and further that as per Exhibit P3, the\nalleged scene of occurrence is the courtyard; and that PW1, in her FIS is seen to\nhave alleged that she ran into her house, when Accused allegedly hit her with\nshovel handle. Admittedly, the alleged scene of occurrence as per deposition of\nPWI1 and Prosecution case is the front portion of her house, which is the house\ncompound. The fact that PW1 stated in her FIS that she was with shovel handle\nwhen she ran into her house as argued by the Learned Counsel for the Accused\ncannot be relied on, for the reason that the attention of PW1 was not brought to\nthe said inconsistency during her examination, nor was the same proved.\n\nIn the case at hand, the evidence of PW1 cannot be said to be wholly\nbelievable, taking into account the inconsistencies in her deposition pertaining to\nthe fact of the police officials taking her to the hospital, no others having witnessed\nthe incident, material improvements as regards the alleged acts of Accused\n\n20\n\nregarding alleged mischief narrated hereinabove coupled with admitted dispute on\naccount of the property, that is, the house herein and the long-standing rift\nbetween the parties inferred from her own admission that she had filed other cases\nagainst the Accused. There is no corroboration on the said aspects, as the evidence\nof PWs 2 and 3, the alleged occurrence witnesses itself is in question. No other\nindependent witnesses have been cited. In fact, PW5 admitted the existence of\nother houses nearby, but none have been made witness to the incident. These\nanomalies, apart from the other reasons have affected the essence of the\nProsecution case, to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, the\ntrespass, if any, though alleged, for reasons of the suspicious circumstances\nbrought out herein, absence of independent witnesses, and failure of the\nProsecution to prove the commission of the alleged offences under Sections 324,\n326 and 427 of the IPC beyond reasonable doubt; cannot be said to be a trespass\nwith an intention to commit the said offences solely by relying on the testimony of\nPW1. Thus, these points are also found in favour of the Accused.\n8. Point (e): In the result, this Court finds that the Prosecution has failed to\nprove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The Accused is found not guilty of having\ncommitted the offences punishable under Sections 447, 324, 326 and 427 of the\nIndian Penal Code and is therefore acquitted of the above offences under Section\n248(1) of the CrPC. His bail bond stands cancelled and he is set at liberty.\n\nThe material objects involved in this case which is the brick prieces(Two in\nNos) andthe shovel handle entered in Property register as T.No. 171/12 being\n\n21\nvalueless shall be destroyed subject to the Rules after the period of Appeal and the\nAppeal, if any preferred; pursuant to its finality thereof.\n\n(Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her,\ncorrected by me and pronounced in open Court on this, the 27\" day of December,\n2024.)\n\nJudicial Magistrate of First Class -I,\nThiruvananthapuram\nAPPENDIX\nRank Name Whether Eye witness, Police\nwitness, Expert witness,\nMedical witness, Other\nwitness\nPW1 Valsala Kumari(CW1) examinaed [Occurrence witness\non 04.02.2016\nPW2 Madhusoodanan(CW2) examined {Occurrence Witness\non 06.02.2017\nPW3 Lathakumari(CW3) examined on [Occurrence witness\n10.10.2019\nPW4 Sivankutti Nair(CW7) examined on|Officical Witness\n28.09. 2022\nPW5 Santhosh Kumar(CW8)examined Official Witness\non 07.12.2023\nPW6 V Saijunath(CW9) examined on Official Witness\n16.01.2024\n\n22\nRank Name Whether Eye witness, Police\nwitness, Expert witness,\nMedical witness, Other\nwitness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness, Police\nwitness, Expert witness,\nMedical witness, Other\nwitness\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA.
