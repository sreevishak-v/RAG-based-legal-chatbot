Evidence adduced by the defence: Ajayakumar was examined as DW1 .He\ndeposed in the examination in chief, that on 17.2.1998 while he was talking to\nhis friends near Kolathukara Temple ,a police van came there and the accused\nwas taken to police station by them . In order to ascertain the reason for the\narrest he followed them to the police station and when he looked through the\nwindow he saw that the accused was manhandled by 4-5 police officers,\nthereafter one of them forcefully poured a liquid on his mouth .He further\ndeposed that CW6 called him and Pramod to his cabin and asked to take the\naccused to hospital ,the accused then told him that he will go to hospital only\nafter seeing the Circle Inspector of police who reached there after some\ntime .According to him the police taken the accused to hospital in a private\nvehicle and admitted in the hospital .\n\n17.Submissions made by the learned counsel for the accused :\n\nThe learned counsel for the accused submitted that the accused had taken to the\npolice station and he was subjected to custodial torture .On the fear that the\naccused will complain against the police party they cooked presebt story and\nlodged FIR against him .According to the learned counsel ,the accused is\ninnocent of the allegations made against him by the prosecution .\n\n18.

From the\nevidence of PW1,PW3 and PW4 itself it can be seen that they have not\nwitnessed the incident .They have heard only the hue and cry of the accused\nperson .\n\n7 Of 11\n21. PWs Dr. Y. A. Ajith was the Assistant Surgeon in General Hospital\nThiruvananthapuram , during the alleged period of incident .The Ext P2\ncertificate was issued by him ,in which multiple lacerations on the scalp were\nnoted .In the Ext P2 wound certificate the reason for the allegation is stated as\nassault by the police .The prosecution allegation was that the accused has\nconsumed alcohol on that particular day .But in the Ext P2 wound\ncertificate ,PW5 had not noted any kind of smell of alcohol or the presence of\nalcohol in his body .In the cross examination of DW1 also he stated that he had\nseen that the accused was being assaulted by police officers and when he talk\nto the accused he had no smell of alcohol on his body and he denied that the\naccused himself hit his head to the window frame of the police station and\ncaused harm himself .\n22.In order to attract the offence u/s.309 of Indian Penal Code the following\nessential ingredients have to be proved by the prosecution :\n° The accused did some act which amounts to an attempt .\n° The aforesaid attempt was directed towards the commission of suicide\n° that his attempt aforesaid did not succeed .\nThe allegation of the prosecution is that the accused attempted to\ncommit suicide by hitting his head to the window .The prosecution has\nnot proved that the injury susatined by the accused may directed to death\nif not properly cared .As per the Ext P2 ,whether the accused was\nadmitted or not is also not stated ,and not stated in the examination in\nchief by PW5 .Apart from these ,CW6 who was the investigating officer\n\n8 Of 11\n\nand who is having direct knowledge about the incident of the above\ncase is not at all examined by the prosecution .\n\n23. The Mental Healthcare Act 2017 has created a \"presumption of\nsevere stress in cases of attempt to commit suicide\". $.115(1) provides\nthus:\n\n\"115. Presumption of severe stress in case of attempt to commit suicide.-\n(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in S.309 of the Indian Penal\nCode (45 of 1860) any person who attempts to commit suicide shall be\npresumed, unless proved otherwise, to have severe stress and shall not\nbe tried and punished under the said Code.\" In Simi C.N v. State of\nKerala 2022(3)KHC 346 the honourable apex court observed that\nUnder, the Act also mandates the Government to provide care, treatment\nand rehabilitation to a person, having severe stress and who attempted to\ncommit suicide, to reduce the risk of recurrence. S.115 begins with a\nnon-obstante provision, specifically with reference to S.309 of the Penal\nCode. It mandates (unless the contrary is proved by the prosecution) that\na person who attempts to commit suicide is suffering from severe stress.\nSuch a person shall not be tried and punished under the Penal Code.\nS.115 removes the element of culpability which attaches to an attempt to\ncommit suicide under S.309. It regards a person who attempts suicide as\na victim of circumstances and not an offender, at least in the absence of\nproof to the contrary, the burden of which must lie on the prosecution.\nS.115 marks a pronounced change in our law about how society must\ntreat and attempt to commit suicide. It seeks to align Indian law with\n\n9 Of 11\nemerging knowledge on suicide, by treating a person who attempts\nsuicide being in need of care, treatment and rehabilitation rather than\npenal sanctions.\"\n24. The learned counsel for the accused has placed reliance on the\njudgment of Honourable apex court XXX v. State of Kerala (WP(C)\nNo. 277794 of 2020 dated 21.10.2024 has produced ,in which the\nretrospective effect of S.115 of mental Health Act has been examined by\nthe Honourable apex court and held that since the legislation is a\nbeneficial one it has retrospective operation .\n25. Coming to the facts of the case ,the offence alleged against the\naccused alleged to have happened within the four walls of the chamber\nof SI of police ,in fact what was happened within the chamber was not\nwitnessed by any one of the prosecution witnesses .CW6 was the\ncompetent person to depose so but he was not examined by the\nprosecution .He is the investigating officer of the above case ,and he was\nnot examined by the prosecution . As per the prosecution case, the\naccused was arrested in execution of a warrant , whereas the details of\nwarrant or any case number had not stated any where in the prosecution\ncase.\n26. On analysing the evidence and facts of the case ,it can be seen that\nthere is no evidence to prove that the accused person has attempted to\ncommit suicide . Hence this point is found against the prosecution.\n\n10 Of 11\n27. Point No.2 :- Upon the finding in point No.1, the accused is found not\nguilty of offence punishable under section 309 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 and\nhe is acquitted of the said offence under section 255(1) Code of Criminal\nProcedure, 1973 . His bail bond stands cancelled and he is set at liberty.\nNo material objects produced in this case.\n[Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected by\nme and pronounced in the open court on this the 31° day of January, 2025].\nSd/-\nJudicial I Class Magistrate-V,\nThiruvananthapuram.\nAPPENDIX\nFORM 62\nList of Prosecution/Defence /Court Witnesses\n(Rule 134 Criminal Rules of Practice, Kerala)\nWhether Eye witness, Police\nRank Name witness, Expert witness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nB.
