Geenakumari)\nThis Crl.M.C. came up for hearing on 25/2/2025 and the court on the\n\n28/2/2025 passed the following :\nCriminal M.C.No.569/2025 1/5\n\nORDER\n\nThis is the 2™ application filed by the 1“ accused in the above crime\nunder Section 483 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking\nregular bail.\n\n2. The petitioner/ 1* accused is alleged to have committed the\noffences punishable under Sections 419, 420, 465, 467, 468 and 471, r/w\nSection 34 of the Indian Penal Code, and Section 66D of the Information\nTechnology Act.\n\n3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- The accused,\n16 in number, with an intention to cheat the defacto complainant, by\ncommitting forgery, misrepresentation and impersonation, obtained from\nhim a substantial amount to the tune of Rs.1.99 Crores, allegedly for the\npurpose of online trading, and thereafter, misappropriated it. It is alleged\nthat, the 1* accused compelled the defacto complainant to install various\napplications in his mobile phone, and thereafter, made him transfer\nsubstantial amounts to the accounts of accused Nos. 2 to 13, and thereafter,\nsiphoned off the money by transferring it to various other accounts.\n\nCriminal M.C.No.569/2025 2/5\n\n4. Reportedly, the petitioner/ 1 accused was arrested on 02.01.2025\nand he is in custody since then.\n\n5. The earlier bail application filed by the petitioner was dismissed\nby this Court as per Order dated 30.01.2025 in Criminal M.C.No. 218/2025.\n\n6. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor.\nThe Investigating Officer filed report opposing the bail application.\n\n7. Heard. Perused the records.\n\n8. | The only point to be considered is, whether regular bail can be\ngranted to the petitioner/ 1* accused.\n\n9. The Point:- The petitioner / 1* accused along with the other\naccused is alleged to have cheated the defacto complainant by inducing him\nto transfer a total sum of Rs.1.99 Crores to the accounts of accused Nos. 2 to\n13, under the pretext of online trading, and thereafter, siphoned off the\nmoney by transferring to various other accounts of the accused.\n\n10. The petitioner submits that, he has not committed any offence as\nCriminal M.C.No.569/2025 3/5\n\nalleged by the prosecution and he has been falsely implicated in this case. It\nis submitted that, the sim cards of the petitioner were misused and committed\nimpersonation by some persons.\n\n11. There is serious allegation as against the petitioner, which is\nbased on a stock market trading. The contention raised by the petitioner’s\ncounsel is that, the defacto comlainant has involved in the online trading with\nfull awareness of the transaction. It is seen from the report filed by the\nInvestigating Officer that, it is the petitioner herein, who had contacted the\ndefacto complainant through Whatsapp and fradulently conducted share\ntrading and illegally obtained around Rs.2 crores. So the prima facie case\nagainst the petitioner and the involvement of the petitioner is made out by\nthe prosecution. The investigation is progressing. The learned Public\nProsecutor strongly opposed the application stating that at the time of the\ncommission of the alleged offence, the petitioner was in Cambodia and he\nhad created fake ID and collected money and there is chance of absconding,\nif he is released on bail. It is seen from the report filed by the Investigating\nOfficer that the money collected by the petitioner / 1* accused was\nCriminal M.C.No.569/2025 4/5\n\ntransferred to several accounts in different States and that the transaction\ndetails of those accounts are yet to be collected. It is seen that the petitioner\nherein is the prime accused in the offence alleged. So, if the petitioner is\nreleased on bail at this stage, he is likely to influence the defacto\ncomplainant and the witnesses and tamper with the evidence. The chance of\nabsconding also cannot be ruled out. Further, no change in circumstances is\nbrought out after the dismissal of the earlier bail application. Considering\nall these aspects, including the gravity of the offence, this court is not\ninclined to release the petitioner on bail at this stage.\nIn the result, this petition is dismissed.\nDictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected\nand pronounced by me in Open Court on this the 28\" day of February, 2025.\nSd/-\nNAZEERA.S\nSESSIONS JUDGE\nTrue Copy By Order\n(Copies : 4)\nTyped by: Anupama\nCompared bv: Rifa FCS: SHERISTADAR\nCriminal M.C.No.569/2025 5/5\n\nCopy of Order in\nCriminal M.C.No.569/2025\nDated 28/2/2025\nCriminal M.C.No.569/2025 6/5\n\n"
