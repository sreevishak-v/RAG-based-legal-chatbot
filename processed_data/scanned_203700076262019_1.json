CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON\n20.11.2019, THE COURT ON 06.01.2020 PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nEERE\nBeen\nCrl.MC.No.7626 OF 2019(C) 2020/KER/T32\n2\nR. NARAYANA PISHARADTI, J\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner is the complainant in the case S.T No.147/2019\non the file of the Court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Thrissur.\n\n2. The complaint filed by the petitioner against the first\nrespondent is under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act,\n1881 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act’).\n\n3. During the trial of the aforesaid case,’ the\npetitioner/complainant was examined as PWi. During the cross-\nexamination of PWi, the first respondent/accused denied the\nsignature in Ext.P1 cheque. Thereafter, the petitioner filed Annexure-E\npetition before the trial court for sending the cheque to an expert for\nobtaining opinion on the signature therein. As per Annexure-F order,\nthe learned Magistrate dismissed the aforesaid application. The\naforesaid order is challenged in this petition filed under Section 482\nCr.P.C.\n\n4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and also the\nfirst respondent.\n\nBape hal\nCrl.MC.No.7626 OF 2019(C) 2020/KER/T32\n3\n\n5. Before considering the merits of the order passed by the\nlearned Magistrate, it is pertinent to note that the ffirst\nrespondent/accused had made a complaint against the\npetitioner/complainant alleging that the petitioner had forged the\nsignature in Ext.P1 cheque and a case was registered against the\ncomplainant by the police in that matter. After investigation of the\naforesaid case, the police filed chargesheet against the\npetitioner/complainant and another person for committing the offences\npunishable under Sections 379,420,465,468 and 471 read with 34\nIPC. The aforesaid case is pending before the Chief Judicial\nMagistrate, Thrissur as C.C No. 166/2016.\n\n6. The case filed by the petitioner/complainant against the\nfirst respondent for the offence under Section 138 of the Act was\npending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate-II, Thrisuur as C.C\nNo. 2875/2013. The aforesaid case was withdrawn to his court by the\nlearned Chief Judicial Magistrate and renumbered as S.T No.\n147/2019.\n\n7.  Itis submitted by the learned counsel for the parties before\nthis Court that simultaneous trial of the aforesaid two cases has been\nheld in the court below.\n\na\nCrl.MC.No.7626 OF 2019(C) 2020/KER/T32\n4\n\n8. It is also pertinent here to note that, during the\ninvestigation of the case filed by the accused against the complainant,\nthe police had collected specimen signatures of the accused and got\nthe signature in Ext.P1 cheque compared with such specimen\nsignatures and obtained a report of the expert. It is submitted before\nthis Court by the counsel for both sides that the expert opinion\nobtained in that case is that the disputed signature in the cheque\ndiffers with the standard signatures.\n\n9. The application filed by the petitioner, for sending the\ncheque for obtaining the opinion of an expert with regard to the\nsignature therein, was dismissed by the learned Chief Judicial\nMagistrate mainly for two reasons. The first reason is that the\ncomplainant was very well aware even earlier that the accused does\nnot admit the signature in Ext.P1 cheque. Learned Magistrate has\nstated in the impugned order that even before the signature in Ext.P1\ncheque was denied by the accused during the cross-examination of\nPW1, the complainant was aware of the aforesaid plea by the accused.\nThe second reason stated by the learned Magistrate for dismissing the\napplication filed by the complainant is that there is already an expert\nreport available in C.C No. 166/2016 and if the complainant has got\n\nBape hal\nCrl.MC.No.7626 OF 2019(C) 2020/KER/T32\n5\ndispute regarding the correctness of the expert opinion available\nbefore the court, he can examine the expert and prove it.\n\n10. As per the submissions made before this Court by the\nlearned counsel for the parties, what the police had done during the\ninvestigation of the case registered against the complainant was to get\nan expert opinion with regard to the signature in Ext.P1 cheque by\ncomparison of it with the specimen signatures taken from the accused.\nWhen the prosecution case in C.C No. 166/2016 is that the\ncomplainant in S.T No. 147/2019 is the person who forged the\nsignature in Ext.P1 cheque, I fail to understand how the expert opinion\nobtained by the police would help the prosecution in C.C No. 166/2016\nto prove the case against the complainant. What is to be proved by\nthe prosecution in C.C No. 166/2016 is that the complainant in S.T No.\n147/2019 is the author of the signature in Ext.Pi cheque and not\nwhether it is a signature put by some other person or not.\n\n11. The two reasons stated by the learned Magistrate for\ndismissing the application filed by the complainant are not sustainable.\nThe first reason stated by the learned Magistrate is that the\ncomplainant was very well aware of the plea of the accused very\nearlier but he did not take any steps earlier to send the cheque for\nexpert opinion. The complainant had every right to wait till the\n\na\n\nCrl.MC.No.7626 OF 2019(C) 2020/KER/T32\n6\n\ncompletion of his evidence and to make his own assessment of the\nevidence and decide whether it is necessary to send the cheque for\nexpert opinion. He might have been earlier confident that he could\nadduce sufficient evidence to prove the execution of the cheque by the\naccused. Only if the evidence adduced by him is found to be\ninsufficient to prove the execution of the cheque by the accused, it\nwould have been necessary for him to take steps to send the cheque\nfor expert opinion. Moreover, mere denial of the signature in the\ncheque by the accused does not oblige the complainant to get expert\nopinion in that regard.\n\n12. The other reason stated by the learned Magistrate, that the\ncomplainant can examine the expert and prove that the report of the\nexpert obtained in the other case is incorrect, is also not sustainable.\nIt is submitted before this Court by the counsel for the parties that no\njoint or consolidated trial of the two cases is conducted and what is\nconducted is only simultaneous trial of both cases. If that be so, the\nfindings in one case cannot be based on the evidence in the other\ncase. The complainant in S.T No. 147/2019 will not be able to bring\nthe evidence in the other case to prove his case. Moreover, it is a\nreport obtained by the police during the investigation of the case\nregistered against him. As noticed earlier, the expert opinion in C.C\n\na\n\nCrl.MC.No.7626 OF 2019(C) 2020/KER/T32\n7\n\nNo. 166/2016 was obtained by comparison of the signature in Ext.P1\ncheque with the specimen signatures of the accused which were\ncollected during the investigation. It is not a report obtained by\ncomparison of the signature in Ext.P1 cheque with the signatures of\nthe accused which were anterior in time to the date of the cheque.\n\n13. Inspite of the above findings, I am of the view that, for\nanother reason, the learned Magistrate was justified in dismissing the\napplication filed by the complainant. Annexure-E application filed by\nthe complainant does not contain the necessary details to be included\nin an application for sending a document for expert opinion. It is not\nstated in Annexure-E application to whom the cheque has to be sent\nfor expert opinion, whether it is to be sent to the forensic science\nlaboratory or to a private expert or to some other person. It is also\nnot stated in Annexure-E application how the comparison of the\nsignature in Ext.P1 cheque has to be made, whether the comparison\nhas to be made with the specimen signatures of the accused to be\nobtained from him or whether the comparison has to be made with the\nsignatures of the accused contained in some documents anterior in\ntime. If the comparison has to be made with the signatures of the\naccused in some documents which are anterior in time to the date of\nExt.P1 cheque, it has to be mentioned in the application, whether any\n\nae ul\nOpt\nCrl1.MC.No.7626 OF 2019(c) 2020/KER/132\n8\nsuch documents are available. In the absence of any such particulars\nmentioned in Annexure-E application, even if the Magistrate had found\nthat the cheque had to be sent for expert opinion, the application\ncould not have been allowed by the learned Magistrate.\n\n14. At this juncture, it would be advantageous to refer to a\npassage from the decision in Ajithkumar v. Rejin Kumar: ILR\n2009(3) Kerala 43, which gives a clear idea regarding the burden on\nthe parties to prove the genuineness of the signature in the cheque in\na case under Section 138 of the Act. In the aforesaid decision, this\nCourt had held as follows:\n\n“The learned Magistrate has compared the signatures\nof the drawer in Ext.P1 with the admitted signatures\nof the accused in some documents, Ext.P5\nacknowledgement card and  Ext.D3 specimen\nsignature card of the accused produced by D.W.2,\nwhich was maintained by the bank wherein the\naccount relating to Ext.P1 was operated. In the\nimpugned judgment, reference is also made that\ncomparison was made with another document\nexhibited as Ext.D5, presumably it must be a mistake\nas Exts.D1 to D3 alone were exhibited by the accused.\nStrangely enough, no comparison was made by the\nlearned Magistrate of the signature appearing in\nExt.P1 with the signatures of the accused seen in\nExt.P7 agreement. Signature of the accused in Ext.P5\nacknowledgement card and his _vakkalath for\n\na\nCrl.MC.No.7626 OF 2019(C) 2020/KER/T32\n9\ncomparison with the signature in Ext.Pi by the\nlearned Magistrate to determine whether Ext.P1 had\nbeen signed by the accused, no doubt, was a futile\nexercise. No relevance could have been given to the\nsignature of the accused in Ext.P5 acknowledgement\ncard and vakkalath which have got only self serving\nvalue and, further, those signatures were subscribed\nby the accused after the dishonour of Ext.P1 cheque.\nStrangely enough, the learned Magistrate has also\ntaken the statement of PW.1 in his evidence that\nthere is difference in the signature of Ext.P1 and P5\nacknowledgement card of the accused as a\ncircumstance justifying his conclusion that the\nsignature in Ext.P1 cheque differed from the\nsignatures of the accused in other documents. The\naccused who disputed his signature in Ext.Pi has not\ntaken any step to substantiate his plea of not signing\nthat instrument was lost sight of by the learned\nMagistrate when he proceeded to compare the\nsignature appearing in Ext.P1 with the signatures of\nthe accused in some documents of which other than\nExt.D3 specimen card could have been given any\nvalue for the purpose of comparison. I fail to\nunderstand why the learned Magistrate has not\nverified the signature in Ext.P1 with Ext.P7\nagreement, the stamp papers which had been\npurchased in the name of the accused nearly four\nmonths prior to the presentation of Ext.P1 cheque\nbefore the bank. No burden was cast upon _ the\ncomplainant to prove that the signature appearing in\nExt.P1 was that of the accused as it was for the\n\nne eo)\nBer\nCr1.MC.No.7626 OF 2019 (Cc) 2020/KER/132\n10\n\naccused to establish his defence that the instrument\nadmittedly covered by the account maintained by him\nwas not signed by him. To sustain his case that the\ninstrument was forged and his signature was\nfraudulently subscribed by someone else in Ext.P1\ninstrument as contended by the accused, he should\nestablish it by taking steps for sending the document\nfor forensic examination with such other documents\ncontaining his signatures subscribed at an anterior\npoint of time earlier to Ext.P1. No such step was taken\nby the accused other than causing the production of\nExt.D3 specimen signature card relating to his account\nwhich is hardly sufficient to show that Ext.P1\ninstrument was not signed by him. He has not even\nmade any attempt to substantiate his defence over\nthe denial of his signature in Ext.P1 cheque. Opinion\ngiven by D.W.2, the Secretary of the Bank that the\nsignature in Ext.P1 differed from the signatures of the\naccused in Ext.D3 specimen card, which, of course,\nthe learned Magistrate has not taken into account, is\nunworthy of any value.”\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n15. Therefore, it is for the complainant to rethink whether the\nevidence adduced by him is sufficient to prove the execution of Ext.P1\ncheque by the accused. If he is advised that it is necessary to get\nexpert opinion with regard to the signature in Ext.P1 cheque, I find\nthat it would be proper to give him an opportunity to file a proper\napplication before the trial court for that purpose.\n\nEERE\npare\nCrl1.MC.No.7626 OF 2019(c) 2020/KER/132\n11\n\n16.

The\naccused who disputed his signature in Ext.Pi has not\ntaken any step to substantiate his plea of not signing\nthat instrument was lost sight of by the learned\nMagistrate when he proceeded to compare the\nsignature appearing in Ext.P1 with the signatures of\nthe accused in some documents of which other than\nExt.D3 specimen card could have been given any\nvalue for the purpose of comparison. I fail to\nunderstand why the learned Magistrate has not\nverified the signature in Ext.P1 with Ext.P7\nagreement, the stamp papers which had been\npurchased in the name of the accused nearly four\nmonths prior to the presentation of Ext.P1 cheque\nbefore the bank. No burden was cast upon _ the\ncomplainant to prove that the signature appearing in\nExt.P1 was that of the accused as it was for the\n\nne eo)\nBer\nCr1.MC.No.7626 OF 2019 (Cc) 2020/KER/132\n10\n\naccused to establish his defence that the instrument\nadmittedly covered by the account maintained by him\nwas not signed by him. To sustain his case that the\ninstrument was forged and his signature was\nfraudulently subscribed by someone else in Ext.P1\ninstrument as contended by the accused, he should\nestablish it by taking steps for sending the document\nfor forensic examination with such other documents\ncontaining his signatures subscribed at an anterior\npoint of time earlier to Ext.P1. No such step was taken\nby the accused other than causing the production of\nExt.D3 specimen signature card relating to his account\nwhich is hardly sufficient to show that Ext.P1\ninstrument was not signed by him. He has not even\nmade any attempt to substantiate his defence over\nthe denial of his signature in Ext.P1 cheque. Opinion\ngiven by D.W.2, the Secretary of the Bank that the\nsignature in Ext.P1 differed from the signatures of the\naccused in Ext.D3 specimen card, which, of course,\nthe learned Magistrate has not taken into account, is\nunworthy of any value.”\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n15. Therefore, it is for the complainant to rethink whether the\nevidence adduced by him is sufficient to prove the execution of Ext.P1\ncheque by the accused. If he is advised that it is necessary to get\nexpert opinion with regard to the signature in Ext.P1 cheque, I find\nthat it would be proper to give him an opportunity to file a proper\napplication before the trial court for that purpose.\n\nEERE\npare\nCrl1.MC.No.7626 OF 2019(c) 2020/KER/132\n11\n\n16.
