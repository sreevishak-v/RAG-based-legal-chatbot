JUSTICE SUNIL THOMAS\nTUESDAY, THE 4TH DAY OF OCTOBER 2016/12TH ASWINA, 1938\nCr1.MC.No. 6581 of 2016\nSc 1075/2010 OF IST ADDITIONAL ASSISTANT SESSIONS\nCOURT , THIRUVANANTHAPURAM\nPETITIONER/1ST ACCUSED. :\nJAYACHANDRAN,\nS/O KRISHNAN NAIR, AGED 47, PLAVILAKATHU VEEDU,\nTC.NO.4/631, SREEVILAS LANE,\nKOWDIAR PO, THIRUVANANTHAPURAM.\nBY ADV. SRI.M.SREEKUMAR\nRESPONDENT (S) /STATE. :\nSTATE OF KERALA,\nREPRESENTED BY THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR,\nHIGH COURT OF KERALA, ERNAKULAM.682031.\nBY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR SRI E.C.BINEESH\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION\nON 04-10-2016, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE\nFOLLOWING:\nK.V.\n\nnS\n2016/KER/42489\nSUNIL THOMAS, J.\nDated this the 4\" day of October, 2016\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner herein is the 1* accused in S.C. No.1075/2010\nof 1* Additional Assistant Sessions Court, Thiruvananthapuram,\nwho stands indicted for offences punishable under Sections 498A,\n306 read with 34 of IPC. The matter is now pending before the 4\"\nAdditional Sessions Court, Thiruvananthapuram as_ S.C.\nNo.100/2014. The charge was read over on 20.09.2016 and\nthereafter, the matter was scheduled for trial from 17.10.2016 to\n19.10.2016.\n\n2. The grievance of the petitioner herein is that, the\ncounsel for the petitioner is engaged in other pre-fixed matters\nand hence he is not in a position to conduct the trial on those\ndates. It was submitted that, the matter was brought to the\nnotice of the court below which was turned down and the court\nproceeded to post the case on 17.10.2016. According to the\npetitioner, he had engaged a lawyer about 4 years back and at\nthis stage change of the lawyer is not possible. Learned counsel\nseeks appropriate reliefs invoking Section 482 Cr.P.C.\n\nnS\n2016/KER/42489\nCri. M. C. No. 6581 of 2016 2\n\n3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the\nlearned Public Prosecutor.\n\n4. The grievance of the petitioner is based on the\ninconvenience of the lawyer who is engaged in other trial fixed on\nthose dates. Essentially scheduling a matter by a trial court is\ndependent on the pendency of cases, whether the case is ripe\nand other priorities including the availability time. When the\ncourt exercise that discretion it may not be proper on the part of\nthe High Court to exercise Section 482 Cr.P.C. to upset the\nschedule.\n\n5. Having regard to these, | am not inclined to interfere\nwith the schedule now fixed by the court below. However, if the\npetitioner has a genuine grievance, he may move the court below\nwith an appropriate application based on the available records\nestablishing, the inconvenience, so that the court can evaluate\nthe available materials and pass a considered order.\n\nCrl.M.C. is disposed of.\n\nSd/-\n: SUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE.\nn\n\n"
