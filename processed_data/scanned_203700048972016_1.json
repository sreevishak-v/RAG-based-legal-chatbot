TO JUDGE\nmbr/\n\nBSED\n2016/KER/33888\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN, V., J.\nDated this the 3” day of August, 2016\nORDER\n\n1.The 1* petitioner is the owner of a lorry bearing\nregistration No.KL-10-V-6473. The aforesaid vehicle was\nseized on 28.7.2016 on the allegation that the same was\n\nused for illegal transportation of ordinary earth.\n2.As per Rule 32 of the Kerala Minerals (Prevention of illegal\nMining, Storage and _ Transportation) Rules, 2015\n(hereinafter referred to as “the Transportation\nRules,2015”) any offence punishable under the said rules\ncan be compounded, either before or after the institution\nof the prosecution, by the person authorized under\nSection 22 of the Mines and Minerals (Development and\nRegulation) Act, 1957 or clause (ii) of Rule 2 of the\n\nESS\n2016/KER/33888\nCri.M.C. No. 4897 of 2016\n-2-\n\nTransportation Rules, 2015, to make a complaint to the\nCourt with respect to that offence, on payment to that\nperson, for credit to the Government, of such sum as that\nperson may specify. Referring to Annexure-2, it is\nsubmitted that the 3% respondent is the officer authorised\nto make a complaint to the Court or to compound the\noffence.\n\n3.The grievance of the petitioners is that the vehicle has not\nbeen produced before the 3 respondent till date. The\nprayer in this petition is to issue direction to the 2\"\nrespondent to act in terms of the Transportation Rules,\n2015 and to produce the vehicle seized before the 3”\nrespondent. It is further prayed that directions be issued\nto the 3 respondent to provide an opportunity to the\npetitioners to compound the offence under Rule 32 of the\nTransportation Rules, 2015.\n\n4.I have heard the learned Public Prosecutor as well.\n\npene\n\nner A Eee\n\npeer Fa\n2016/KER/33888\n\nCrI.M.C. No. 4897 of 2016\n\n=-3-\n\n5.I find considerable merit in the submission of the learned\ncounsel. It is evident on a reading of Rule 32 of the\nTransportation Rules, 2015 and also S.R.O No. 375 of\n2015 produced by the petitioners that the 3% respondent\nis the competent authority to prefer complaint before the\nlearned Magistrate and also to allow the compounding of\nthe offence. Hence, the following directions are issued, to\nsecure the ends of justice :-\n\ni. The 2™? respondent is directed to produce\nthe aforesaid vehicle involved in the offence\nbefore the 3% respondent within a period of\ntwo days from the date of receipt of a copy of\nthis order.\n\nii. The 3’ respondent shall permit the\npetitioners to compound the offence under Rule\n32 of the Rules, if the same is permissible\nunder law.\n\nii. The above endeavour shall be completed\nwithin a period of 5 days from the date of\nreceipt of this order.\n\nBae\nner A Eee\npeer Fa\n2016/KER/33888\nCrI.M.C. No. 4897 of 2016\n-4-\nIf the offence is compounded in terms of Rule 32 of the\nTransportation Rules, 2015, necessarily the vehicle shall\nbe released forthwith. This petition is disposed off.\nsd/-\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN, V.\nJUDGE\nPs/4/8/16\n\n"
