Third\nrespondent is the defacto complainant.\n\n3. The prosecution alleges that on 03.10.2023 the accused\nrestrained the complainant due to previous enmity and assaulted him\nand thereby committed the offences alleged.\n\n4. Heard the learned Counsel for the petitioners and the learned\nCounsel for the respondent apart from the learned Public Prosecutor.\n\n5. The learned Public Prosecutor pointed out that the 2\" petitioner,\nwho is the 2™ accused is a habitual offender and is involved in 11 other\ncrimes of which 9 are of the Varkala Police Station, as Crime\nNos.847/2013, 607/2019, 688/2019, 1599/2017, 1886/2014, 4439/2020,\n\nBaan\n2024/KER/6451\nCRL.MC NO. 114 OF 2024\n3\n267/2021, 280/2021, 1979/2021, 442/2021 and 1870/2023, which\nincludes offences under Sections 307, 326, 308 and even Section 27 of\nthe Arms Act. However, it was pointed that petitioners 1 and 3 are not\ninvolved in any other crimes of Varkala Police Station.\n\n6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303], the\nApex Court has held that in appropriate cases, the High Court can take\nnote of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim and the\nwrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. This view was\nreiterated in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466]\nand Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State of Jharkhand and\nAnother [(2014) 9 SCC 653].\n\n7. Though petitioners and defacto complainant are alleged to\nhave settled the entire disputes as evident from Annexure A3, which has\nbeen verified by the learned Public Prosecutor through the Investigating\nOfficer, | am of the view that considering the criminal antecedents of the\n24 petitioner, quashing of the crime on the basis of the settlement as\nagainst him may not be conducive to public interest. The nature of\noffences and the other crimes stand against him in quashing the\nproceedings as against the 2™ petitioner. As far as petitioners 1 and 3,\nare concerned, since there are no criminal antecedents and the matter\nhas been settled with the defacto complainant, this Court is of the view\nthat the proceedings against those petitioners can be quashed",
