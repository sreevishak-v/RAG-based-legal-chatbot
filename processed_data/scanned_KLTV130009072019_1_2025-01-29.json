After hearing\nprosecution and counsel for accused Nos. 1 to 3,charge framed for offence w/s.\n498(A) read with section 34 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 , read over and\nexplained to the accused Nos. 1 to 3, to which they pleaded not guilty and\nclaimed to be tried.\n\n5. On the side of prosecution, PW1 was examined and Exhibit P1 was marked.\nAs the material witnesses failed to support the prosecution case, the learned\nAssistant Public Prosecutor gave up the CW2 to CW14. In the absence of any\n\n4 of 6\n\nincriminating circumstances against the accused Nos. 1 to 3, questioning of the\n\naccused Nos1 to 3 , under section 313(1)(b) Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973\n\nwas dispensed with.
