It appears that, there was a counter case as C.C.No.9\nof 2014, in which, CW1 was the de facto complainant. In that case,\nAnnexure-Al application under section 302Cr.P.C was laid on a\npremise that since CW1 in C.C.No.9 of 2014 was the accused in\nC.C.No.1930 of 2015 and if it is conducted by the same Assistant\n\nPublic Prosecutor, there is likelihood of prejudice.\n\n2. Court below, after hearing the petitioner herein and the\nlearned Assistant Public Prosecutor dismissed the application after\nperusing the files. It was found by the learned magistrate that,\nAssistant Public Prosecutor of the Judicial First Class Magistrate\nCourt, Punalur was to conduct the prosecution in C.C.No.9 of 2014.\nOther connected case was conducted by another Public Prosecutor.\nCourt below rightly concluded that, since the case and counter case\nare handed by different Public Prosecutors, no prejudice will be\ncaused to the victim in the case and there is no likelihood of\n\nBee\nE] ry\n2017/KER/49283\nCril.M.C.4681/17\n2\nmiscarriage of justice. Evidently, the apprehension of the petitioner\nherein stand allayed by the very fact that two separate Assistant\nPublic Prosecutors are conducting the cases. Having considered\nthis, I find no ground for challenge in the case.\nCrl.M.C fails and is dismissed.\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS\nJudge\nSbna/6/12/17\nTrue Copy / P A to Judge\n\n"
