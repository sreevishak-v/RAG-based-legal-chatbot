CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON\n08.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nCRL.M.C.No.4835 of 2019 2 2021/KERI273\nORDER\nDated this the 8th day of January 2021\n\nThis Crl.M.C. is filed to quash the entire\nproceedings in C.C.No.101 of 2018 on the file of\nthe Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Thodupuzha.\n\n2. The above case is charge sheeted by the\nMuttom Police against the petitioner and another\nalleging offences punishable under Sections 406,\n420, 468 and 471 r/w. Section 34 of the Indian\nPenal Code(IPC).\n\n3. The prosecution case in brief is as\nfollows:\n\nThe defacto complainant is the registered\nowner of a BMW 530 D Car bearing NO.KL-43-A-6677.\nThe defacto complainant borrowed an amount of\nRs.5,50,000/- from the 1** accused. As a lien for\nthe said amount, the defacto complainant handed\nover the said car to the 1* accused on\n\nCRL.M.C.No.4835 of 2019 3 2021/KERI273\n13.12.2013. Thereafter, the defacto complainant\nwent to abroad to continue his business. After\ntwo years of the above transaction, the defacto\ncomplainant came back from abroad. He was ready\nto return the money which was borrowed from the\n1%* accused to get back his vehicle which was\nunder the possession of the 1% accused. The 1**\naccused informed that, he has transferred the\nvehicle to the 3°? accused. He informed that, now\nthe vehicle is under the police custody in\nconnection with Crime No.502 of 2016 of Kanjar\nPolice Station. Hence, Annexure Al complaint was\nfiled before the Judicial First Class Magistrate\nCourt-1, Thodupuzha. The said complaint was\nforwarded to the Police by the learned Magistrate\nunder Section 156(3) Cr.P.C. and accordingly\nAnnexure A2 F.I.R. was registered. Thereafter,\nAnnexure A3 final report was filed by the Police\nagainst the petitioner and other accused.\n\n4. Heard the learned counsel for the\n\nCRL.M.C.No.4835 of 2019 4 2021/KERI273\npetitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.\n\n5. The learned counsel for the petitioner\nsubmitted that, even if the entire allegations in\nAnnexure A3 final report is accepted in toto, no\noffence is made out against the petitioner who is\nthe 2\"* accused. The counsel submitted that, even\nif the statement of witnesses cited by the\nprosecution, which was recoded under Section 161\nCr.P.C. is accepted, there is no allegation\nagainst the petitioner. The counsel submitted\nthat, prima facie, no offence is made out against\nthe petitioner.\n\n6. The learned Public Prosecutor submitted\nthat, in the final report, it is stated that, the\npetitioner and the other accused together\ncommitted the offence and therefore, this Court\nmay not quash the proceedings against the\npetitioner alone.\n\n7. After hearing both sides, I think, this\nCr1.M.C. can be disposed of allowing’ the\n\nCRL.M.C.No.4835 of 2019 5 2021/KERI273\npetitioner to file a discharge petition before\nthe lower court. If so, it would be better to the\ntrial court to peruse the records filed by\nthe prosecution and can decide whether any\nprima facie case is made out or not against the\npetitioner. All the contentions raised by the\npetitioner in this Crl.M.cC. are left open. The\npetitioner is free to raise all these contentions\nbefore the lower court. In the facts and\ncircumstances of this case, the learned\nMagistrate will give an exemption from personal\nappearance before the lower court except when his\npresence is inevitable, if such an application to\nthat effect is filed by the petitioner.\n\nTherefore, this Crl.M.C. is disposed of with\nthe following directions:\n\n1) Tf the petitioner file an\napplication for discharge, the learned\nMagistrate will consider the same and pass\nappropriate orders in accordance to law if\n\nCRL.M.C.No.4835 of 2019 6 2021/KERI273\nthe charge is not framed so far. If the\nabove application is filed by the\npetitioner within one month from today, the\nlearned Magistrate will dispose of the same\nas expeditiously as possible, at any rate,\nwithin six weeks from the date of receipt\nof that application;\n\nii) If an application is filed by the\npetitioner for exemption from personal\nappearance, the learned Magistrate will\nallow the same in accordance to law.\n\nSd/-\nP.V.KUNHIKRISHNAN\npkk JUDGE\n\neel\nae\nea Attest ren\nBee\n2021/KER/1273\nCRL.M.C.No.4835 of 2019 7\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE Al CERTIFIED COPY OF THE COMPLAINT FILED\nBEFORE THE JFCM-1 COURT AT THODUPUZHA IN\nCMP NO.9756/2016 BY DEFACTO COMPLAINANT.\nANNEXURE A2 CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FIR REGISTERED BY THE\nMUTTOM POLICE IN CRIME NO.929/16.\nANNEXURE A3 CERTIFIED COPY OF THE CHARGE SHEET FILED BY\nTHE MUTTOM POLICE IN CC NO.101/2018.\n//TRUE COPY//\nSD/-\nP.S.
