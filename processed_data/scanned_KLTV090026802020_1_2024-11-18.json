Sanoj R Nair)\nRespondent : Sreenivasan, S/o. Padmanabhan,\nKunnumpurathu Veedu, Pullekonam,\nKaryavattom P O, thiruvananthapuram-695 581\n(By Adv.K Kusumam)\nOrder MC is dismissed for default of the Petitioner\nand for want of Prosecution.\nThis case having finally come up for consideration before this Court on\n18.11.2024, this Court on the same day passes the following:\nORDER\n1. This case arose on an Application filed under Section 12 of the Protection of\nWomen from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (hereinafter referred to as the “DV Act’) by\nthe Petitioner herein, against the Respondent, who is the husband of the Petitioner.\n2. This case stands posted for the evidence of the Petitioner since 21.05.2022.\nThere were change in Vakalat of the Petitioner on 23.09.2022 and thereafter there was\nno representation of the Petitioner. Pursuant to issuance of registered notice, the\nPetitioner appeared on 14.08.2023 and informed that she is unable to prosecute the\ncase and Protection Officer was directed to meet the Petitioner. The Complainant was\nabsent continuously on subsequent postings, ie. on 17.11.2023, 27.12.2023,\n09.02.2024, 16.02.2024, 27.04.2024. The Respondent was duly represented on the\nabove postings except on 17.11.2023 and 27.04.2024. The evidence was adjourned to\n\n07.06.2024 on request of the Petitioner’s Counsel on 27.04.2024, on which date, she\nwas absent and time granted again to adduce evidence on 15.06.2024. Fresh Vakalat\nwas filed on her behalf on the said date and evidence was adjourned to 20.07.2024,\non which date there was no representation on her behalf, but she personally\nappeared before this Court and raised grievance that she be allowed to withdraw the\ncase and stated that she is already represented by a Legal Aid Counsel and denied\nsuggestion to appoint another Legal Aid Counsel. This Court had addressed the\nHon'ble DLSA with the above matter along with the letter submitted by her. On\nsubsequent postings, there was no representation on her behalf by the Counsel who\nhad filed fresh vakalat on her behalf and nor was she present before this Court.\nNotice was issued to her through Protection Officer and the Protection Officer\nreported that the notice has been affixed on her house on 30.08.2024. Further\nopportunity was granted to the Petitioner for her appearance on 15.11.2024, but she\ndid not turn up before this Court. A fair opportunity was granted to the Petitioner\nto appear before this Court and to adduce evidence as No further Time and matter\nwas adjourned to 18.11.2024. However, despite the presence of the Respondent,\nneither the Petitioner nor her Counsel turned up before this Court. On enquiry with\nthe Hon’ble DLSA, it was ascertained that panel lawyer had been appointed for\nconducting her case.\n\n3. It is pertinent to note that despite having granted sufficient opportunities to\nthe Petitioner to adduce evidence as elucidated above, when the matter was taken up\nthis day, the Petitioner remained absent. There was no representation for the\nPetitioner. The Accused was present and represented by their Counsel. The\nRespondent has been continuously represented throughout. Umpteen opportunities\nhave been granted to the Petitioner. Neither is the Petitioner present before this Court\nnor is she represented by her Counsel and no bonafide reason stated for the non-\nappearance of the Complainant.\n\nIn wake of the above circumstances, it appears to this Court that the Petitioner\ndoes not intend to proceed with the above matter further and her unexplained\nabsence fortifies the same. Hence, on the said satisfaction, this Court finds it\ninappropriate to continue this proceeding any further in the absence of the Petitioner,\n\nas the same is only a futile exercise; taking into account the stage of the case and\nserious prejudice that would be caused to the Respondent, if matter is proceeded\nfurther in the said scenario. Therefore, this MC is dismissed for default of the\nPetitioner and for want of Prosecution.\n4. Resultantly, this MC is dismissed for default of the Petitioner and for want of\nProsecution.\nPronounced in open court on this the 18\" day of November, 2024.\nJudicial Magistrate of First Class -I,\nThiruvananthapuram.\n\n"
