If the accused Nos. 1 to 4 are found guilty? What is the order of the\nsentence?\n\n9. Point Nos. 1 to 5 :-To avoid repetition and for brevity, points Nos. 1 to 5 are\nconsidered together. Prosecution case is that accused persons have committed\noffences punishable under sections 143, 147, 149, 283 and 188 of Indian Penal\nCode, 1860.\n\n10. PW1, Antony Isaac was examined by the prosecution to prove the occurrence\nbut he denied his statement to the police and deposed that he didn't witness\nany such obstruction of public pathway by the accused persons as alleged by\nthe prosecution .\n\n11.PW2, Sudheer denied his statement before the police and deposed that he had\nnot witnessed any such incident as alleged by the prosecution.\n\n12. PW3, Antony Augustine deposed that on 30.4.2016 he was on duty with SHO\nand Homeguard and had seen that 50 people under the leadership of Anto Elias\nmarched to Valiyaveli Church road .He further deposed in the examination in\nchief that he doesn't know the reason for the march .In the cross examination\nhe deposed that the police party had not received any complaint from the\n\n6 Of 13\ngeneral public .To the question that whether they face any difficulty in moving\nthrough the way he answered that they did nâ€™t have.\n\n13. PW4, Rajasekharan Nair was the home guard attached to Poonthura Police\nstation during the said period .He deposed that on that day he was doing\npatrolling duty along with other officers and witnessed that about 50 persons\nunder the leadership of Anto Elias were marching. According to him the SH O\nasked them to march without causing any kind of obstruction to public. He\nfurther deposed that he cannot properly identify whether the persons standing\nat the dock were in the march . He was tumed hostile to the prosecution case.\n\n14. PW5, Jayasanil.R was the SHO of Thumba police station during the alleged\ntime of incident .He deposed that he along with SCPO Antony Augustin and\nHome guard Rajasekharan Nair went on patrolling duty .He further deposed\nthat on getting the information that about 50 CPIM workers under the\nleadership of Anto Elias marching by obstructing the public way in\nValiaveli,they reached their and saw that,they were marching from Valiaveli\nground to the north of Valiaveli Church and then back to Valiaveli ground by\ncausing obstruction to the public way .Due to the insufficient number they\ncouldn't arrest the accused persons .He further identified his signature in Ext\nP1 report and registered Ext P2 FIR . According to him, the ExtP3 scene was\n\n7 Of 13\nprepared on the next day. He identified the accused persons .\n\n15.PW6, Prathapachandran deposed that on 1.5.2016 he was doing patrolling duty\nalong with PW5. He deposed that the Ext P4 report consists of name and\ndetails of the accused persons , he further identified Ext P2 FIR and Ext P3\nscene mahasar .In the cross examination he deposed that police party has not\nreceived any complaint from the general public .\n\n16. Submission made by learned App : The learned APP submitted that the\nprosecution has proved guilt of the accused persons and hence they are not\nentitled acquittal.\n\n17. Submissions made by learned counsel for the accused persons : The\nlearned counsel for the accused submitted that though the prosecution alleges\nthat the march lead by accused no.1 obstructed the public way and caused\ndisturbance to the general public ,no independent witness could be examined\nby the prosecution to prove the guilt of accused .Hence accused persons are\nentitled to get acquittal .\n\n18. Evaluation of evidence _: PW1 and PW2 were the independent witnesses\n\n8 Of 13\nproduced by the prosecution to prove the scene mahasar and occurrence of the\nincident . However they were turned hostile to the prosecution case . The\nreason for the march is nowhere stated by the prosecution .PW3 to PW5 were\nthe official witnesses .PW3 in the examination in chief itself deposed that he is\nunaware of the reason for the march ,further deposed that even after the\ndirection of PW5 , the S H O the accused persons were not dispersed the march\n-According to him there was obstruction of public way .Whereas PW4 who\naccompanied PW3 and PW5, deposed that the SHO only gave a direction to do\nmarch without causing disturbance of public way but he cannot identify the\naccused persons .In the cross examination of PW4 he deposed that the police\njeep was following the march and when the march returned back they\naccompanied the march .PW6 in the cross examination admitted that there was\nno complaint from the general public. Now let's examine whether the\nprosecution has proved that the accused persons did the march in violation of\nthe order promulgated by the public servant and thereby obstructed the public\nway .The reason for the march /rally by the accused persons is not proved by\nthe prosecution . None of the witnesses deposed that the march caused any\nobstruction to the public or in any way caused hindrance to the public right of\nmovement .It is the common understanding of an ordinary prudent man that\nwhen a public pathway is obstructed it would affect the public at large .And the\npublic is the proper source to depose whether they are disturbed by the march\nor not .There is no such evidence to that effect .Furthermore PW4 ,who\n\n9 Of 13\naccompanied the police party itself stated that the police party were following\nthe march to the north and on the return of the march .\n\n19. Now let's examine whether the offence u/s.188 of the Indian Penal Code is\nattracted in the facts of the present case or not .S.188 is extracted as follows :\nS.188: Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant.--\nWhoever, knowing that, by an order promulgated by a public servant\nlawfully empowered to promulgate such order, he is directed to abstain\nfrom a certain act, or to take certain order with certain property in his\npossession or under his management, disobeys such direction,\nshall, if such disobedience causes or tends to cause obstruction, annoyance\nor injury, or risk of obstruction, annoyance or injury, to any person\nlawfully employed, be punished with simple imprisonment for a term\nwhich may extend to one month or with fine which may extend to two\nhundred rupees, or with both;\nand if such disobedience causes or trends to cause danger to human life,\nhealth or safety, or causes or tends to cause a riot or affray, shall be\npunished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may\nextend to six months, or with fine which may extend to one thousand\nrupees, or with both.\n\n20. In order to take cognizance of the offence u/s.188 of IPC there is an express\n\n10 Of 13\n\nbar u/s.195 of Code of Criminal Procedure1973 . In Santhosh Kumar v. State\nof Kerala (2020 (5) KLT 322) it was held by the Honourable high court of\nKerala that a Court can take cognizance of the offence under S.188 IPC only\non a formal complaint filed by the public servant himself. The present case is\ntaken on a police report and not on a complaint made by the public servant .In\nshort the cognizance of S.188 itself is barred . Resultantly I am of the view\nthat accused persons were not committed the offence u/s.188 of IPC.\n\n21. As far as the offence u/s.283 is concerned ,the prosecution has to establish that\nthe accused persons formed an unlawful assembly in order to obstruct the\npublic way or public line of navigation . Analysing the facts of the case with\nthe evidence of witnesses nobody except PW3 and PWS stated that public way\nis obstructed .Though PW3 and PW5 states that there was an obstruction of\npublic way by the march ,nobody from the general public has the complaint\nthat there way was obstructed by accused persons . Furthermore there is no oral\nevidence to show that it was an unlawful assembly ,since the remaining 46\npersons were not identified or listed by the prosecution .In Poulose K.K. v.\nState of Kerala (2013 (4) KHC 539) it has been held that mere allegation\nthat a meeting was organized by a group of persons blocking traffic is not\nsufficient, to prosecute persons having unlawfully assembled, the ingredients\nthereof has to be satisfied. It is discussed there in that the question to be\n\n11 Of 13\nexamined is whether the assembly was unlawful. The unlawful assembly has\nbeen defined under 5.141, IPC. One of the five situations covered by that\nSection has to be satisfied to hold that the assembly consisting of more than\none person was an unlawful assembly.\n\n22. In Preetha K.K. and others v. State of Kerala and another (2016 (2) KLT\n482) it was observed as follows : As far as the offence under S.283 of the IPC\nis concerned, there should be some clear and cogent material to disclose that\nobstruction was caused to any person in any public way. In none of the\nstatements and materials, which are accompanying the impugned Annexure - I\nfinal report / charge sheet is there even a remote whisper anywhere therein as\nto any alleged obstruction caused by anyone of the accused to persons who are\nusing the public way. Not even a single person so alleged to be obstructed by\nany such alleged act of the accused is even arrayed as witness in Annexure - I\nproceedings.\"\n\n23. Freedom of assembly, freedom of speech and expressions are guaranteed by\nthe constitution to each individuals. Only when is the act of an accused,\nbecome offensive, then the offence u/s.283 will be attracted Apart from the\nevidence of PW3 and PW5 that there was an oral order of the SHO to\nterminate the march ,there is absolutely no other evidence that it caused any\n\n12 Of 13\nobstruction to the public -Hence in the light of above judgments and\nconsidering the acts it cannot be said that the accused were committed offences\nu/ss. 143, 147, 149, 283 and 188 of Indian Penal Code, 1860. Hence these\npoints are answered against the prosecution .\n24, Point No. 6 :- Upon the finding in point Nos. 1 to 5 the accused Nos. 1 to 4 are\nfound not guilty of offences punishable under sections 143, 147, 149, 283 and\n188 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 and they are acquitted of the said offences\nunder section 255(1) Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Their bail bond stands\ncancelled and they are set at liberty.\nNo material objects produced in this case.\nDictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected by me\nand pronounced in the open court on this the 28\" day of November, 2024.\nSd/-\nJudicial I Class Magistrate-V,\nThiruvananthapuram.\nAPPENDIX\nFORM 62\nList of Prosecution/Defence /Court Witnesses\n(Rule 134 Criminal Rules of Practice, Kerala)\nWhether Eye witness, Police\nRank Name witness, Expert witness, Med-\nical witness, Other witness\nOther witness\n\n13 Of 13\nB.
