Karthika S Varma\nJudicial First Class Magistrate-I, Thiruvananthapuram\nDated, this the 4“ day of February, 2025\nC.M.P. No. 44 of 2025\nIn\nM.C. No. 26 of 2018\nPetitioner Aisha Kunju, aged 78 years, W/o.Muhammed\nRasheed, residing at TC 20/1328, Mangatt Veedu,\nMangattu Lane, Karamana Post,\nThiruvananthapuram-695 002\n(By Adv. Sreena B Sreekumar )\nRespondent Muhammad Rafi, aged 53 years, S/o. Muhammed\nRasheed, residing at TC 20/1328, Mangatt Veedu,\nMangattu Lane, Karamana Post\nProvision Section 25(2) of the Protection of Women from\nDomestic Violence Act\nOrder The Petition is dismissed\nThis Application having finally come up for consideration before this\nCourt 03.02.2025 and this Court on 04.02.2025 passed the following:\nORDER\n1. This is an Application filed under Section 25(2) of the Protection of\nWomen from Domestic Violence Act (hereinafter referred to as the ‘PWDV Act’)\nseeking for the revocation of the Interim Order in C.M.P No. 301/2018 and\npermitting the Petitioner herein to enter into the shared household.\n2. The Petitioner herein is the Respondent in the above M.C. This Court had\nvide Order dated 30.06.2018 passed an Interim Protection Order in favour of\nthe Counter Petitioner herein, who is the Petitioner in the M.C., restraining the\nPetitioner herein from physically and verbally harassing the Counter-Petitioner.\n3. The case of the Petitioner is that the Counter Petitioner herein is her\nmother and that she had obtained an Order from this Court in C.M.P. No.\n\n2\n\n301/2018 preventing him from entering into the premises where his mother is\nresiding. His ninety-two-year-old father, suffering from various illness, is now\nlaid up in the shared household. His father informed a neighbour that he would\nlike to see him in the shared household, however the interim Order as stated\nprevents him from doing so. Hence this Petition to permit him to visit his father\nin the shared household in the interest of justice. Hence this Petition.\n4., Copy of the Petition was served to the Counter Petitioner, and the\nCounter Petitioner strongly objected to the revocation of the Interim Protection\nOrder.\n5. Heard both the sides. The following points arise for consideration:\n\n(i) Is the Petitioner entitled for revocation of the Interim Protection\n\nOrder?\n\n(ii) Finding/Order.\n6. Point (i): At the outset, the Learned Counsel for the Respondent herein\nsubmitted that the actual Petitioner herein, that is, the Respondent in the M.C.\nwas stated as ‘Respondent’ itself in this Petition and vice-versa which itself is\npatently defective. It is further pointed out that the interim Protection Order\nwas in fact granted vide Order in C.M.P. No. 302/2018 dated 30.06.2018 and not\nC.M.P. 3011/2018. Attention of this Court was drawn to the the Order of the\nMaintenance Tribunal Thiruvananthapuram, directing the Petitioner herein\nfrom vacating the shared household and also to the Order of the Hon’ble High\nCourt in WP. (C) No. 966/2021 dated 22.06.2021, preferred against the said\nOrder of the Tribunal by the Petitioner herein, which was partly allowed in\nfavour of the Petitioner, holding that the said finding of the Tribunal pertaining\nto the Petitioner vacating the shared household is not liable to be interfered.\nThe Learned Counsel submits that there is no requirement for revocation of the\nInterim Protection Order granted and the circumstances so alleged by the\nPetitioner herein to visit his age-old father is only a pretext to make an entry to\nthe shared household and further harass the Respondent herein. It is further\n\n3\n\nargued that there are ongoing civil as well as criminal proceedings pertaining to\nthe said property including proceeding under the PWDV Act filed by the\nPetitioner’s wife against the Respondent herein and her husband; four criminal\ncases against the Petitioner herein for the offences punishable under Sections\n294(b), 323, 506(i) r/w 34 of the IPC and also two civil suits pertaining to the\nproperty. The M.C. is in the stage of Respondent’s evidence and this Petition is\nfiled only on experimental basis without any bonafides. In the event the interim\nprotection order is revoked, the same would cause serious prejudice to the\nRespondent herein as it would pave way for their harassment.\n\nPer contra, the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner submits that the\ndefects in the cause title and the C.M.P No. occurred on account of\ntypographical mistake and on the said ground alone this Petition cannot be\ndismissed and sticked on to his contentions as stated in the Petition.\n\nI have carefully gone through the materials on record and considered the\nsubmissions of the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner as well as Counter\nPetitioner. It is pertinent to note that it is under any change of circumstances\nthat this Court can modify/alter/revoke the interim order already passed by\ninvoking the power of this Court under Section 25(2) of the PWDV Act. This\nCourt accept the contention of the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner that solely\non the reason of technicality, there cannot be a non-adjudication of this Petition.\nHowever, on perusal of the Order of this Court dated 30.06.2018, it is crystal\nclear that this Court had only granted an Ad-Interim Protection Order and the\nwords thereto does not in any manner restrain the residence of the Petitioner\nherein into the Shared Household. There is no Order passed by this Court till\ndate to the effect that the Petitioner shall remove himself from the Shared\nHousehold or any part thereto. The ad-Interim Protection Order was passed by\nthis Court on the prima-facie satisfaction of the acts of Domestic Violence to\nhave taken place against the Counter Petitioner herein. The circumstance being\nsuch, any revocation of the said Order would defeat the very purpose of having\ngranted the same in the first instance, as rightly pointed out by the Learned\nCounsel for the Respondent. As already stated, there is no Order passed by this\nCourt till date to the effect that the Petitioner shall remove himself from the\nShared Household or any part thereto. Nor can the ad-interim Protection Order\n\nA\nalready passed be construed in the said manner. Therefore, a question of\nrevocation of the said Order does not arise in the said circumstances. This Court\ncannot delve into and interpret the Orders of the Hon’ble High Court of Kerala\nand the Maintenance Tribunal, despite to take notice that there are Orders to\nthat effect pronounced by the said authorities. This point is therefore answered\naccordingly.\n7. Point(ii): Resultantly this Application is dismissed.\n(Pronounced in open court on this the 4\" day of February, 2025.)\nSd/-\nJudicial Magistrate of First Class -I,\nThiruvananthapuram\nTrue Copy\nJudicial Magistrate of First Class -I,\nThiruvananthapuram\n\n"
