The case against the petitioner is now\npending before the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate Court, Chavakkad as CC No.1522/2014.\n\n2. The facts in brief is that, the\npetitioner is a Managing Director of the\nSanthimadom Builders and Developers Trust,\nNorth Paravur and he had undertaken\nconstruction of some villas in Kottappadi.\nEven though the construction work has been\ncompleted, the disputes arose with respect to\nthe expenses incurred and other incidental\nworks. The petitioner has a lot of defence to\n\n2020/KER/613\nCr1.MC.No.9266 OF 2019 (G)\n3\nmake on the ground that due to recent amendment\nin the Archeology Department, the work could\nnot be completed as decided. Several cases are\npending against the petitioner admittedly.\n\n3. Under the circumstances, I do not find\nany ground whatsoever to quash the proceedings\npending before the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate, Chavakkad. There is also civil\ndispute pending. Argument of the learned\ncounsel appearing for the petitioner is that,\nthe dispute has to be resolved by a civil court\nis not acceptable because the mere fact that,\nthere is a civil dispute will not automatically\nabsolve the petitioner's criminal liabilities.\nTt is therefore, not possible to consider this\napplication to quash the proceedings. The\npetitioner is directed to appear before the\nJurisdictional Magistrate and face trial.\n\n2020/KER/613\nCr1.MC.No.9266 OF 2019 (G)\n4\n\nThe learned counsel for the petitioner\nsubmits that, he may be permitted to get\nexemption from personal appearance. It is for\nthe Magistrate to decide the same on\napplication being filed by the petitioner.\n\nWith these observation the Crl.M.C is\ndisposed of.\n\nSd/-\nASHOK MENON\nJUDGE\n\nSPK\n\nDare\npert\nEe fe aH\n2020/KER/613\nCrl1.MC.No.9266 OF 2019(G)\n5\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE Al PHOTO COPY OF THE F.I.R.
