CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n11.01.2021, ALONG WITH Cr1.MC.81/2021(A), THE COURT ON THE SAME\nDAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nBeads\nCrLMC.8I & 83/2021 3 2OURERABS\nV.G.ARUN, J.\nCRL.M.C.Nos.81 and 83 of 2021\nDated this the 11\" day of January, 2021\nORDER\n\nPetitioner in Cril.M.C.No.81 of 2021 is the owner of a fishing boat,\n\nregistered at Lakshadweep. The boat was seized on 12.1.2020, as part\n\nof investigation in Forest Crime No.1 of 2020 registered at the Forest\n\nRange Office, Kavaratti. The crime was registered, and the petitioner's\n\nboat seized, during a combined operation by a team of officers from\n\nthe Police, Fisheries and the Environment and Forest Departments, on\n\nthe allegation that the boat was found to be carrying dead and live\n\n‘Sea Cucumbers’, which is a prohibited item. The offences alleged are\n\nunder Sections 9, 39(3)(a), 40, 42, 49(a) and 49(b) of the Wildlife\n\nProtection Act (for short, 'the Act') and Section 120 of the Indian Penal\nCode.\n\n2. The petitioner approached the jurisdictional Magistrate Court\n\nseeking interim custody of his boat. By Annexure B order, the boat was\n\ndirected to be released on interim custody, subject to certain\n\napes\nBae\nCrLMC.81 & 83/2021 4 202 UKERITSS\n\nconditions. Petitioner complied with the conditions and thereupon,\n\nAnnexure C order was issued, directing to release the boat. In the\n\nmeantime the investigating officer filed a revision against Annexure B.\n\nBy Annexure D order, the Sessions Court allowed the revision in part.\n\nThe petitioners’ claim for interim custody was upheld and additional\nconditions imposed for releasing the boat.\n\n3. Aggrieved by Annexure D, the petitioner approached this Court\nin Crl.M.C.No.4431 of 2020 challenging Annexure D, primarily on the\nground that the Sessions Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the\nrevision filed against an interlocutory order. This Court, after elaborate\nconsideration of the legal issue involved, found the revision before the\nSessions Court to be not maintainable and Annexure D order to be\nunsustainable. Consequently, Annexure D was set aside and the\npetitioner permitted to approach the Magistrate Court for\nimplementation of Annexure B order. The contentions of the\nrespondent against Annexure B was left open. The petitioner again\napproached the jurisdictional court seeking release of the boat and got\nAnnexure F order issued, directing to release the boat forthwith.\n\n4. Crl.M.C.No.83 of 2021 is filed seeking release of the boat, in\nimplementation of Annexure B order of the Magistrate Court, Annexure\nE order of this Court and the consequential Annexure F order.\nCrl.M.C.No.81 of 2021 is filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation\n\nBeads\nCrLMC.81 & 83/2021 5 202 UKERITSS\n\nwhich has taken over the investigation in Forest Crime No.1 of 2020, as\ndirected by the Administrator, Union Territory of Lakshadweep. The\nchallenge in Crl.M.C.No.81 of 2021 is against Annexure B order, by\nwhich the jurisdictional court had ordered release of the petitioner's\nboat. For the sake of convenience, the parties and documents are\nreferred to, as described in Crl.M.C.No. 83 of 2021.\n\n5. Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the\njurisdictional Court having issued Annexure B order on 20.3.2020,\ndirecting release of the petitioner's boat and this Court having made it\nclear that the petitioner is free to approach Magistrate Court for\nimmediate implementation of the order, there is absolutely no\njustification in refusing to release the boat. It is submitted that fishing\nis the only means of livelihood of the petitioner and the deliberate\ndelay in releasing the boat is causing substantial prejudice and\nhardship to him. The boat being supposed to the vagaries of nature, is\ngetting ruined and its engine is getting damaged due to non-user for a\nlong period.\n\n6. The learned Standing Counsel for the CBI contended that, in\nview of Section 39(1)(d) of the Wildlife Protection Act, the boat has\nbecome the property of the Government and that, ‘Sea Cucumber’\nbeing an item listed under Schedule | Part IV-C of the Act, the learned\nMagistrate could not have granted interim custody of the boat to the\n\nBeads\nCrLMC.81 & 83/2021 6 2021/KERITS3\n\npetitioner. It is submitted that though the initial investigation was\nconducted by the Forest Department, later the Lakshadweep\nAdministrator decided to entrust investigation with the CBI, since it\nwas suspected that the Sea Cucumber was being collected by local\nfishermen and thereafter transferred to larger vessels as part of\ninternational trade. It is contended that the conditions imposed in\nAnnexure B order are not sufficient to ensure production of the boat as\nand when required.\n\n7. In reply, the learned counsel for the petitioner placed reliance\non the decisions in Mathew v. Range Officer [2004(2) KLT 865] and\nState of Kerala v. Thomas K.B [2018(1) KL] 213] to contend that, till\nit is established that the boat was used for commission of the offence,\nthe boat will not become the property of the Government and the\njurisdictional Magistrate can pass order regarding interim custody.\nAccording to the learned counsel, the sole reason behind filing\nCril.M.C.No.81 of 2021 is to delay release of the boat in spite of\nAnnexures B, E and F orders.\n\n8. The facts reveal that Annexure B was subjected to challenge\nbefore the Sessions Court, resulting in Annexure D order. A perusal of\nAnnexure D order shows that it was passed after hearing the CBI\nProsecutor. The contention based on Section 39(1)(d), though raised\nbefore the Sessions Court, was found against the prosecution. But,\n\napes\nBae\nCrLMC.81 & 83/2021 7 2021/KERITAS3\nAnnexure D order was not challenged by the CBI. Further, in Annexure\nE order this Court permitted the petitioner to move the Magistrate\nCourt seeking immediate release of his boat.\n\n9. Since this Court left open the contentions against Annexure B,\nthe challenge against that order is liable to be considered on merits.\nSection 39(1)(d), which is the basis on which the order is challenged, is\nto the effect that every vehicle, vessel, weapon, trap or tool that has\nbeen used for committing an offence and seized under the provisions\nof the Act shall be the property of the Government. Therefore, it is\nevident that for becoming the property of the Government, the\nvehicle, vessel, weapon or tool should have been used for committing\nthe offence. Interpreting this provision, this Court has held in Mathew\nand Thomas K.B that the conclusion of the vehicle, vessel, weapon,\ntrap or tool having been used for committing the offence can be\nreached only after trial of the case. It was also held that Magistrate\nCourts are not denuded of the power to release the articles on interim\ncustody. | am in respectful agreement with the said decisions. Further,\nin my considered opinion, release of the boat on interim custody will\nnot have any adverse impact on the investigation.\n\nFor the reasons above mentioned, Crl.M.C.No.81 of 2021 is\ndismissed and Crl.M.C.No.83 of 2021 is allowed. The respondents\ntherein are directed to release the petitioner's boat.
