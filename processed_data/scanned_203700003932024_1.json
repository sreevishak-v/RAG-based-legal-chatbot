On the latter posting, it was adjourned to 10.08.2023\nfor further hearing and thereafter, it has not been considered. The said\napplication has thus not been disposed of till date.\n\n2. Having regard to the submissions made by Sri.Vinay Mathew\nJoseph, learned Counsel for the petitioner as well as the Smt.V.Sreeja, learned\nPublic Prosecutor, | am of the view that this Crl.M.C. can be disposed of with a\ndirection.\n\n3. Since the application for discharge has been pending consideration\nfrom 2021, there will be a direction to the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,\nlrinjalakkuda to consider and pass appropriate orders on C.M.P.No.3211/2021 in\nC.C.No.270/2016, as expeditiously as possible, at any rate within a period of two\nmonths from the date of receipt of a copy of this judgment.\n\nsd/\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\njm/\n\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 393/2024 ines\n2024/KER/3893\n\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES\n\nAnnexure 1 TRUE COPY OF THE CHARGE SHEET DATED 31.12.2015\nFILED IN CRIME NO. 1503/2010\n\nAnnexure P2 TRUE COPY OF THE PETITION BEING THE CMP NP.\n3211 OF 2021 PENDING BEFORE THE JFCM,\nIRINJALAKUDA\n\nAnnexure P3 TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER SHEET IN THE CC 2700/2016\nBEFORE JFMC, IRINJALAKUDA\n\n"
