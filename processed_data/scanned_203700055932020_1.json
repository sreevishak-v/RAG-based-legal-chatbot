The de facto complainant at whose instance\nthe crime was registered is the 1* respondent.

Having considered the gravity of the offences alleged,\nnature of the injury caused and having perused the affidavit filed\nby the 1* respondent, the contents of which are submitted to be\ntrue and voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled and\nthat no public interest is involved in this matter. The fact that\n\nCee\nos\nCrme 5593/2020 A 2021/KER/1098\n\nthe petitioners as well as defacto complainant were Law\nstudents when the incident occurred is also taken into\nconsideration.

As such,\ncontinuance of the proceedings will amount to an abuse of\nprocess of court and hence, in view of the legal position set out\nby the Honourable Supreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v.\nState of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh v.
