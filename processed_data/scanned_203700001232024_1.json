In order to facilitate the\npetitioner to surrender before the Magistrate court, the\nnon-bailable warrant now pending against the petitioner\nshall be kept in abeyance till 31.01.2024.\n\nWith these directions this Crl.M.C. is disposed of.\n\nSd/-\nSOPHY THOMAS\nJUDGE\n\nSSK/08/01\n\nBlea\nae area\nBA seni\n2024/KER/1255\nCr1.M.C.
