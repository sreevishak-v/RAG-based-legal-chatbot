As per the said condition,\nwhile directing release of a tipper lorry bearing Registration No.KL-20-F-\n9404, on interim custody under Section 457 of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure, 1973, the learned Magistrate has directed a cash deposit of\nRs.1,60,000/- which is stated to be equivalent to the value of the vehicle\nand also to execute a bond for the said amount with two solvent sureties.\n\n2. After hearing Sri.Govind R., the learned counsel for the\npetitioner as well as Smt.Sreeja V., the learned Public Prosecutor, I am of\nthe view that the condition directing deposit of cash security for releasing\na vehicle involved in an alleged illegal transportation of ordinary earth in\nviolation of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act,\n1957 is too onerous a condition. Since the learned Magistrate has also\nimposed a condition to furnish a bond with two solvent sureties, I am of\nthe view that the security in the form of a property or a bank guarantee,\nequivalent to the value of the vehicle would suffice.\n\n3. Therefore, condition No.1 directing deposit of cash security of\nRs.1,60,000/- in the order dated 15.12.2023 in Crl.M.P.No.8199 of 2023\n\nBee\n\nsare\n\nBSR ar\n\n2024/KER/1158\nCRL.MC NO. 161 OF 2024\n3\non the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-II, Neyyattinkara\nshall stand modified and the petitioner is permitted to furnish security\neither in the form of a property of equivalent value or a bank guarantee\nto the satisfaction of the learned Magistrate.\nThe Crl.M.C.is disposed of with the above modification to Annexure\nA2.\nSd/-\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, JUDGE\n\nRKM\n\nBiehl\nBe ae\neae hg\nler\n2024/KER/TI58\nCRL.MC NO. 161 OF 2024\n4\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 161/2024\nPETITIONER'S ANNEXURES :\nAnnexure Al A TRUE COPY OF THE CRL.
