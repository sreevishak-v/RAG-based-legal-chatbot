The prosecution case is that on 15.02.2015, at about 19:30\nhours, the petitioner/accused hit on the face of the de facto\ncomplainant with a hammer causing fracture to the bones of his nose\nand jaw and thereby the petitioner committed an offence punishable\nunder Section 326 IPC.\n\n3. The case against the petitioner was registered as Crime No.\n196/2015 of Chittur Police Station on the basis of the statement given\nto the police by the de facto complainant. After completing the\ninvestigation, final report was filed against the petitioner for an\noffence punishable under Section 326 IPC and the learned Magistrate\nhas taken cognizance of the offence.\n\n4. This petition is filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C for quashing\nthe proceedings against the petitioner in the case on the ground that\nhe is totally innocent.\n\nbie\nCrl.MC.No.3318 OF 2018 2020/KERIS\n3\n\n5. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned\nPublic Prosecutor and also the first respondent/de facto complainant.\n\n6. The allegations against the petitioner in the chargesheet,\nprima facie, disclose the commission of an offence punishable under\nSection 326 IPC by him.\n\n7. The witness list filed by the prosecution along with the\nchargesheet shows that, apart from the de facto complainant/injured,\nseven other eye-witnesses are cited by the prosecution to prove the\nalleged incident. Further, there is also medical evidence to be adduced\nto prove the injuries sustained by the de facto complainant. The\nhammer alleged to have been used by the petitioner for committing\nthe offence has also been recovered and produced before the trial\ncourt.\n\n8. Whether the hammer recovered by the police is a\ndangerous weapon or not, whether the injuries sustained by the de\nfacto complainant could have been caused by that hammer etc. are\nmatters of evidence.\n\n9. The plea of the petitioner that it was the de facto\ncomplainant and his relatives who attacked him and that he had acted\nonly in self defence is also a plea to be raised before the trial court\nand to be proved by him before that court.\n\nCrl.MC.No.3318 OF 2018 2020/KERIS\n4\n\n10. In the aforesaid circumstances, I find that there are no\nsufficient grounds to quash the chargesheet filed against the petitioner\nor the proceedings initiated against him on the basis of the\nchargesheet.\n\nConsequently, the petition is dismissed",
