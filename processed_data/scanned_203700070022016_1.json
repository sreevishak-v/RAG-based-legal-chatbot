A. TO JUDGE\nPn\n\n2017/KER/236\nSUNIL THOMAS, J.\nDated this the 4â€˜ day of January, 2017\nORDER\n\nThe husband, who is the 1* accused in CC No.564/2011 of\nAdditional Chief Judicial Court, Thiruvananthapuram, charged with\noffences punishable under Sections 498A, 323, 324, 506(ii), 34\nIPC has filed this Crl.M.C. under Section 482 Cr.P.C.\n\n2. Petitioner married the complainant on 07.05.2006.\nThe petitioner was employed in Military Service. Matrimonial\ndiscord led to the lodging of the complaint alleging matrimonial\ncruelty against the husband and in-laws. Her allegation was that\nshe was subjected to matrimonial cruelty both physically and\nmentally on various occasions. The contention of the husband is\nthat, he was always away from home except when he came on\nleave. There could not have been any harassment during the\nlimited days of leave. The allegations in the complaint are\ninherently improbable. Hence, he sought to quash the\nproceedings.\n\n3. The complaint and the statement of the wife show that,\nafter two months of marriage, husband left to his work place in\nJammu Kashmir. She became pregnant and during that period\n\n2017/KER/236\nCri. M. C. No. 7002 of 2016 2\nshe was subjected to cruelty by in-laws. After delivery, the\nhusband came down, but he behaved very cruelly towards her.\nWhen she was thrown out from the house, husband supported the\nin-laws. She has stated another instance when she was subjected\nto physical cruelty by the petitioner, along with other accused.\n\n4. It is clear that even though, husband was away, his\ndirect and indirect role is narrated by the complainant. In the\nabove circumstance, it cannot be said that no allegation is made\nout. Hence, | am not inclined to invoke Section 482 Cr.P.C.\n\nCrl.M.C. fails and is dismissed.\n\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE.\nPn\n\n"
