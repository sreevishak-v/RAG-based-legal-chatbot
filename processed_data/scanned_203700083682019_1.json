CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n08.01.2020, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\npees\nCrl.MC.No.8368 OF 2019 (E) 2020/KER/BIO\n2\nORDER\nDated this the 8th day of January 2020\n\nThe petitioner is aggrieved by the impugned order of\nthe learned Sessions Judge at Annexure A2, where the\nbail granted to the petitioner in crime No. 265/2019 of\nKodakkara Police Station was cancelled for the reason\nthat he failed to comply with condition no.4 which\ninsisted that he shall not get involved in any other\ncrime during the pendancy of the bail. The bail was\ngranted on 09/07/2019, but soon thereafter on\n13/07/2019, he got involved in another crime as crime\nNo. 322/2019 of Kodakkara Police Station and consequent\nto that, the learned Sessions Judge cancelled the bail\ngranted to him by way of impugned order. The petitioner\nis aggrieved and is before this Court.\n\n2. The learned counsel appearing for the\npetitioner submits that as per Annexure Al, the defacto\ncomplainant in Crime No. 322/2019 has filed an affidavit\nstating that the petitioner was not involved. The FIR\nalso does not show his name. It gives the name of two\npersons and other five are unidentified. The learned\nSessions Judge had considered the said affidavit and has\n\npees\n\nCrl.MC.No.8368 OF 2019 (E) 2020/KER/BIO\n3\n\nstated that for the purpose of granting of bail, the\npetitioner and accused Ratheesh had approached the\ndefacto complainant and requested his father to say\nbefore the Court that the petitioner was not involved\namong the other accused. His father is a sick person and\nout of fear of the accused, his father went to the\noffice of the lawyer of the accused and instructed\nfiling an affidavit. Only in order to keep the word of\nhis father, the defacto complainant reached the Court\nand informed that the petitioner, Sreekuttan was not\ninvolved in that crime. It is apparent that it is out of\nfear and coercion that he had made such a statement in\nthe affidavit filed before the Court.\n\nThe learned Sessions Judge on understanding these\ncircumstances cancelled the bail granted to- the\npetitioner. I find no reason whatsoever to interfere in\nthis finding and _ therefore, the criminal MC is\ndismissed.\n\nSd/-\nASHOK MENON\nNsd JUDGE\n//true copy//\nPA to Judge\n\nce\nie wae icy\nEe:\nCrl.MC.No.8368 OF 2019(R) 2020/KER/810\n4\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE Al TRUE COPY OF THE AFFIDAVIT DATED 23/10/2019\nSUBMITTED BY THE DEFACTO COMPLAINANT.\nANNEXURE A2 CERTIFIED COPY OF THE ORDER DATED\n11/11/2019 IN CRL.MP NO. 3244/2019 IN\nCRL.M.C NO. 1089/2019 OF THE SESSIONS\nJUDGE, THRISSUR.\n\n"
