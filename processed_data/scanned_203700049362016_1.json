The learned counsel\nurges that the said judgment was rendered while dealing\nwith vehicles seized under the provisions of the Kerala\nProtection of River Banks and Regulation of Removal of\nSand Act, 2001. The learned counsel also relies on the\njudgment of this Court in Sasi v. State of Kerala (2013\n(4) KLT 731) to contend that this Court has taken a view\nthat the dictum of law laid down in Shan (supra) cannot\nbe made applicable while considering the applications\nseeking interim custody of the vehicles seized invoking the\nprovisions of the MMDR Act, 1957. Finally the learned\ncounsel submits that the provisions of MMDR Act as well\nas the Kerala Minerals (Prevention of illegal Mining,\nStorage and Transportation) Rules, 2015 (hereinafter\n\nBil\n2016/KER/33894\n\nCrl.M.C.
