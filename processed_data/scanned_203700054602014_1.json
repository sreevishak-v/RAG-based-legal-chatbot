The petitioners now seek\norders quashing the prosecution, on the ground that they and the\ndefacto complainant have come to terms amicably out of court.\nThe complaint was in fact made against two named persons, and\nsome other identifiable persons. In spite of efforts made during\ninvestigation, the police could not identify and detect those\npersons, and so submitted final report against these two accused.\nThe defacto complainant has filed affidavit before this Court that\nthe whole dispute between him and the accused stands resolved\nforever, and that he has no grievance or complaint now.\nThough there is an allegation under the Arms Act, the\n\nBiehl\n2015/KER/1269\n\nCri M.C.. No. 5460/2014 2\n\nsustainability of such prosecution is really doubtful.
