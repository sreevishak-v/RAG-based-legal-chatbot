The offences alleged against the petitioner are under\nSection 420 read with 34 IPC and also under Section 10 read with\n24(1)(a) and (b) of the Emigration Act, 1983.\n\n3. The prosecution case is as follows: The first accused\nconducted an institution for recruitment of persons for job abroad.\nThere was no licence or certificate obtained by the first accused for\nconducting the recruitment agency. The passports of many persons\nwere obtained and kept in the office of the establishment of the first\naccused. The passports were obtained from job aspirants on the\npromise that job would be arranged for them abroad. No job was\narranged for any person. When some persons wanted to get back their\npassports, money was demanded for returning the passport.\n\n4. The case was registered suo motu by the Sub Inspector,\n\nPane\n\nCrl.MC.No.1503 OF 2019(G) 2020/KER/12\n3\n\nErnakulam Town South Police Station after conducting search of the\nestablishment of the first accused and seizing passports of many\npersons from there. After completing investigation, chargesheet was\nfiled against the first accused and the petitioner for the offences\nmentioned above.\n\n5. This petition is filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C by the second\naccused for quashing the proceedings against him in the case.\n\n6. Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned\nPublic Prosecutor.\n\n7. Learned counsel for the petitioner would contend that there\nis absolutely no material produced by the prosecution to prove that\nthe petitioner had dishonestly induced any person to part with his\npassport or that he had promised any person that he would get job for\nhim abroad and therefore, the offences alleged against the petitioner\nwill not lie against him.\n\n8. Admittedly, the petitioner was only a_ staff of the\nestablishment conducted by the first accused. I have perused the\ncopies of the statements of witnesses recorded by the investigating\nofficer. No witness has stated that the petitioner has made any\ninducement to him to part with the passport. No witness has given\nstatement to the police that the petitioner had offered or promised\n\nCrl.MC.No.1503 OF 2019(G) 2020/KER/12\n4\n\nthat he would arrange any job for such person abroad. No witness has\ngiven any statement to the police that the petitioner had deceived him\nin any manner. Even if it is accepted that, as a staff of the\nestablishment run by the first accused, the petitioner had obtained\nand kept the passports of some persons in the office of the\nestablishment, it is not sufficient to implicate him in an offence\npunishable under Section 420 IPC.\n\n9. Admittedly, the petitioner is not the person who was\nconducting the recruitment agency. Therefore, the offence alleged\nagainst him under the Emigration Act will also not lie against him.\n\n10. In the aforesaid circumstances, continuation of the\nprosecution against the petitioner would be an abuse of process of the\ncourt. The proceedings against him are liable to be quashed",
