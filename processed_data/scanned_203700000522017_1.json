He challenges the\norder in Annexure-A2, which is an application for interim\ncustody of the vehicle owned by him and involved in the\ncase. The application was rejected. The reasons stated\nby the court below is that, the report of the investigating\nofficer revealed that the confiscation proceedings were\ngoing on at the instance of the Deputy Excise\nCommissioner, Kollam. Consequently the court held that\nit had no authority to release the vehicle and the petition\nwas consequently dismissed.\n\n2. Challenging this, the learned counsel contended\nthat the order of the court below is not legally sustainable\nin the light of the clear statutory provision holding that\n\n2017/KER/1227\n\nCri.M.(C).No.52 of 2017 2\n\nthe confiscation proceedings will not be a bar in ordering\nthe release of the vehicle. The learned counsel invited my\nattention to the decision reported in [Abdul Nazer Vs\nState of Kerala (2014 (3) KHC 3125)], wherein the\ncourt considered this legal aspect and ultimately ordered\nthat the vehicle may be released subject to the execution\nof the bond. However the learned counsel fairly invited\nmy attention to the clarification given by the Division\nBench of this court in unreported decision in W.A.No.1408\nof 2016, wherein the Division Bench it confirmed that the\nvehicle can be released on cash security and not on\nexecution of the bond. Necessarily, the value has to be\nfixed by the court below on the basis of a report of the\ncompetent authority as provided under the statute. The\nlearned counsel also fairly submitted that he can produce\nan equivalent cash security as fixed by the court below.\nIn the light of above, the impugned order is set aside and\nCMP.No.4127 of 2016 will stand allowed. The court below\nshall assess the value of vehicle on the basis of materials\nplaced, as provided under the statute and release the\n\n2017/KER/1227\nCrl.M.(C).No.52 of 2017 3\nvehicle on such terms and conditions as it may fix as per\nthe statute as expeditiously as possible.\nCrl.M.C is disposed of accordingly.\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE\n\nR.AV\n\n//{True Copy//\n\nPA to Judge\n\n"
