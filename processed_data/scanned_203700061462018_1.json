The specific contention of the petitioners, who are accused\nNos.1 and 3, is that an earlier crime has been registered at the\nKanyakumari Police Station on the very same allegations and in view\nof the said fact, the second FIR is not maintainable.\n\n3. A statement has been filed by the Asst. Commissioner of\nPolice, District Crime Branch, Thiruvananthapuram. In paragraph\nNo.10, it is stated as follows:\n\n“10. It is learnt that the’ investigation of\nCr.1/2017/EOW II is in progress successfully by the Crime\nBranch wing of Tamilnadu and it is also revealed that the de\nfacto complainant of Cr.1602/2017 of Museum PS had given\nboth oral and documentary evidences as witness before the\ninvestigating agency of Tamilnadu State for the same\ntransactions. Hence action is to be taken to consider and\ntreat the case in Cr.1602/17 of Museum PS as “Further\nAction Dropped” and to that effect a report has to be filed\nbefore the Hon'ble filing court.\n\nape Tal\nops\nCr1.MC.Nos.58 of 2018 2019/KER/93\n& 6146 of 2018 6\n4. It is submitted that steps have been taken to submit a report\nbefore the learned Magistrate, where the matters are pending.\nIn that view of the matter, no separate orders are required\nto be issued. These petitions are closed.\nSd/-\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN V.,\nJUDGE\nIAP\n\nee\nPecan\nBee\nCr1.MC.Nos.58 of 2018 201HKERID3\n& 6146 of 2018 7\nAPPENDIX OF Cr1.MC 58/2018\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE A FIR DATED 15-09-2017 REGISTERED BY\nTAMTLNADU POLICE.\nANNEXURE B TRUE TRANSLATION OF ANNEXURE A IN\nMALAYALAM.\nANNEXURE C TRUE COPY OF FIR IN CRIME NO.1618/2017 OF\nMUSEUM POLICE STATION.\nANNEXURE D CERTIFIED COPY OF FIR IN CRIME 1602/2017 OF\nMUSEUM POLICE STATION.\nRESPONDENTS ' EXHIBITS:\nNIL\nAPPENDIX OF Crl.MC 6146/2018\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE A FIR DATED 15.9.2017 REGISTERED BY TAMILNADU\nPOLICE\nANNEXURE B TRUE TRANSLATION OF ANNEXURE A IN MALAYALAM\nANNEXURE C BAIL ORDER DATED 27.2.2017 PASSED BY\nSPECIAL COURT FOR TRAIL OF TNPID CASES\nMADURAL\nANNEXURE D CERTIFIED COPY OF FIR IN CRIME 1602/2017 OF\nMUSEUM POLICE STATION.\nANNEXURE E COPY OF FIR IN CRIME 1618/2017 OF MUSEUM\nPOLICE STATION\nANNEXURE F COPY OF THE ORDER PASSED BY HON'BLE HIGH\nCOURT OF MADRAS MADURAI BENCH ON 31.7.2018\nRESPONDENTS ' EXHIBITS:\nNIL\n\n"
