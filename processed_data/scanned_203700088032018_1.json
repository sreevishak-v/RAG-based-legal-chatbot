No.794 of 2018\non the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,\nPerinthalmanna. In the aforesaid case, he stands indicted for having\ncommitted offence punishable under Section 509 of the IPC and\nSection 120(0) of the Kerala Police Act, 2011.\n\n3. The prosecution allegation is that the petitioner\ndisseminated false accusations against one Selvakumar, who is his\nsuperior officer, and when the same was questioned by the de facto\ncomplainant, she was abused.\n\n4. I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the\npetitioner, the 2\" respondent and the learned Public Prosecutor. It is\nsubmitted that the entire disputes between the parties have been\namicably resolved. Reliance is placed on the affidavit filed by the 2\"\nrespondent to buttress his submission. It is urged that the dispute is\n\nPleiniaall\nCrl.MC.No. 8803 of 2018 2011KER/T247\n3\npurely personal in nature and would not affect public peace or\ntranquility.\n\n5. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted\nthat the statement of the 2\" respondent has been recorded and she\nhas stated in clear terms that she has no subsisting grievance.\n\n6. I have considered the submissions advanced.\n\n7. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303]\nand in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466], the\nApex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the High Court\ncan take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the\nvictim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings.\n\n8. The offence committed by the petitioner cannot be said to\nbe grave and serious having ingredients of extreme mental depravity.\nIt also does not appear that the offence in this case will have a serious\nimpact on the society.

Even otherwise, persisting with the prosecution would be\nnothing, but a waste of time as the prospects of conviction is bleak.\n\nPleiniaall\nCrl.MC.No. 8803 of 2018 2011KER/T247\n4\nHaving considered all the relevant circumstances, I am of the\nconsidered view that this Court will be well justified in invoking its\nextraordinary powers under Section 482 of the Code to quash the\nproceedings.\n\nIn the result, this petition will stand allowed.
