If the accused is found guilty? What is the order as to sentence?\n\n8. Point Nos. 1 to 3 :-To avoid repetition and for brevity, point nos. 1 to 3 are\nconsidered together. Prosecution case is that accused has committed offences\npunishable under sections 294(b), 341 and 323 of Indian Penal Code, 1860.\n\n9. PW1 Asokan admitted his signature in the Ext P1 statement .He deposed that\nhe has no grievance against the accused person and cannot recollect the\nidentity of the person who assaulted him.

On analysing the evidence of PW1 and PW2,\nthere is nothing to show that the accused had assaulted them.\n\n11. Learned Assistant Public Prosecutor has given up the other witnesses in this\ncase and he is justified in doing so as the material witness failed to support the\n\n5 OF 6\nprosecution case. There is nothing on record to disclose that the accused has\ncommitted the offences as alleged by the prosecution. Having considered the\nevidence on record, this court is of the view that the prosecution has failed to\nprove the guilt of the accused and for the said reasons, point nos. 1 to 3 are\nfound against the prosecution.\n\n12.
