No.8275 of 2019\nORDER\n\nThis is a petition filed under Section 482 of the Code\nof Criminal Procedure for quashing the proceedings pending\nagainst the petitioner in S.C. No. 177 of 2018 on the files of the\nAssistant Sessions Court, Karunagappally.\n\n2. The petitioner is the third accused in Crime No.\n67 of 2012 of Sasthamcotta Police Station registered under\nSections 452 and 511 of 376 read with Section 34 of the\nIndian Penal Code. There were altogether four accused in the\nsaid case. The petitioner was not available at the time of the\ncommittal proceedings. Consequently, the case was committed\nfor trial as against accused Nos.1, 2 and 4. During the\npendency of the proceedings before the trial court, the first\naccused committed suicide. Proceedings in the circumstances,\nwas continued against accused Nos.2 and 4. The trial court\nfound the accused guilty of offences punishable under\nSections 452 and 354 read with Section 34 of Indian Penal\nCode and convicted them. Accused Nos. 2 and 4 challenged\nthe decision of the trial court in Crl.A. No. 20 of 2018.\n\nante\n2020/KER/499\n\nCrl.M.C. No. 8275 of 2019\n\nAnnexure 4 is the judgment in the said case. In terms of the\n\nsaid judgment, the appellate court found that the evidence of\n\nthe prosecutrix who was examined as PW1 was not reliable and\n\nthat therefore, there cannot be any conviction based on the\n\nsaid evidence. Consequently, accused Nos. 2 and 4 were\nacquitted. In the meanwhile, the petitioner appeared before\n\nthe committal court and consequently the case against him\n\nwas also committed for trial as S.C. No. 177 of 2018. The\npetitioner seeks orders to quash the said proceedings on the\nground that in the light of the decision in Crl.A. No.20 of 2018,\n\nthe proceedings now pending against him is an abuse of the\nprocess of the Court as no purpose whatsoever would be\nserved by the said proceedings.\n\n3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as\nalso the learned Public Prosecutor.\n\n4. The essence of the finding, on the basis of which\naccused Nos.2 and 4 were acquitted by the appellate court,\ncontained in paragraph 16 of the judgment reads thus:\n\n“16. On analysing the evidence of PW1, the\nprosecutrix, it is found that her testimony is inconsistent\nwith her earlier version in Ext.P1 on material aspects.\nThe fact that PW1 had not suffered any bodily injury\n\nante\n2020/KER/499\nCrl.M.C. No. 8275 of 2019\nthough she allegedly resisted violent rape attempt by\nfour adult persons is a suspicious circumstance. There\nare material discrepancies and contradictions in the\ntestimony of PW1. Infirmities of this nature would not\nhave occurred in the testimony of PW1 if she was\nspeaking true facts. There is no ring of the truth in the\ntestimony of PW1. The delay of six days is not properly\nexplained. In view of the infirm nature of the evidence of\nPW1, this Court is view that it is not safe to rely on her\ntestimony. In the said circumstances it is held that the\nprosecution has failed to prove that the accused have\ncommitted the offences alleged against them. Point is\nthus held against the prosecution and it is held that the\nconviction and sentence of the court below is not legally\nsustainable.”\nIt is seen that the case against the accused in both cases is\nbuilt on the statement of PW1. Insofar as it is found that the\nsaid statement is not reliable and that there cannot be any\nconviction based on the same, according to me, the\nsubstratum of the case is lost.\n5. If that be so, in the light of the decision of this\nCourt in Moosa v. Sub Inspector of Police (2006 (1) KLT\n552), no purpose whatsoever would be served by directing the\npetitioner to face the trial, and the trial against the petitioner\nwould only be a futile exercise, resulting in wastage of precious\n\neee ean\nEe a\n2020/KER/499\nCrl.M.C. No. 8275 of 2019\njudicial time intended for productive works. The proceedings\nagainst the petitioner, in the circumstances, is liable to be\nquashed",
