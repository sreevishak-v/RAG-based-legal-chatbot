JUSTICE RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN V\nFRIDAY, THE O4TH DAY OF JANUARY 2019 / 14TH POUSHA, 1940\nCr1.MC.No. 6698 of 2018\nMC NO.19/2016 ON THE FILES OF THE JUDICIAL FIRST CLASS MAGISTRATE\nCOURT-I, CHITTUR DATED 06-10-2018\nPETITIONER/RESPONDENT:\nRAJESH, AGED 38 YEARS,\nS/O.SHIVANANDAN, CHITOOR TALUK,\nKODUMBU VILLAGE, CHITOOR.\nBY ADV.

CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 04.01.2019,\nTHE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\n2019/KER/305\nCrl.MC.No. 6698 of 2018 2\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner herein is the respondent in M.C. No.19 of 2016\non the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court No.1, Chitoor.\nThe said case has been initiated by the respondent herein before\nunder the provisions of the Protection of Women from the\nDomestic Violence Act, 2005.\n\n2. The petitioner filed an application to summon a witness\nand by order dated 15.9.2018, the said application was allowed by\nthe learned Magistrate. It is evident from Annexure-A6 that the\ncase was posted to 16.10.2018 and the petitioner was ordered to\ntake steps. On 6.10.2018, as the witness summoned did not\nappear, the learned Magistrate proceeded to close the evidence\nand posted the matter for hearing.\n\n3. Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioner\nand the learned Public Prosecutor.\n\n4. Essentially, the contention advanced by the learned\ncounsel appearing for the petitioner is that the learned Magistrate\n\n2019/KER/305\nCrl.MC.No. 6698 of 2018 3\nwas not justified in not granting the petitioner an opportunity to\nlet in evidence.\n\n5. As to what prompted the learned Magistrate to abruptly\npost the matter for hearing is not discernible from the order.\nWhere a person fails to appear before the Court in spite of the\nservice of summons on him, the Magistrate has to take steps for\nsecuring the presence of the witness under Section 87 of the\nCode.\n\n6. For the aforementioned reason, the order dated\n6.10.2018 closing the evidence is set aside. The learned\nMagistrate is directed to secure the presence of the witness\nsummoned by the petitioner as per law and afford an opportunity\nto the petitioner to let in evidence.\n\nWith the above said direction, this petition is disposed of.\n\nSD/-\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN V.,\nJUDGE\nDSvi-\n\nBes\n2019/KER/305\nCrl.MC.No. 6698 of 2018 4\nAPPENDIX\n\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\n\nANNEXURE Al THE TRUE COPY OF MC.19/2016 FILED BY THE\nRESPONDENT HEREIN.\n\nANNEXURE A2 THE TRUE COPY OF THE COUNTER STATEMENT\nFILED BY THE PETITIONER HEREIN.\n\nANNEXURE A3 THE TRUE COPY OF PROCEEDINGS DATED 4.9.2018\n\nANNEXURE A4 THE TRUE COPY OF THE PROCEEDINGS DATED\n15.9.2018\n\nANNEXURE A5 THE TRUE COPY OF THE PETITION FILED BY THE\nPETITIONER HEREIN BEFORE THE COURT BELOW\nSEEKING SUMMONING OF THE WITNESS AND ALSO\nFOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENT, ALONG WITH THE\nWITNESS SCHEDULE.\n\nANNEXURE A6 THE TRUE COPY OF THE PROCEEDINGS DATED\n25.9.2018.\n\nANNEXURE A7 THE TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER [PROCEEDINGS]\nDATED 6.10.2018.\n\nroe\nope\n2019/KER/305\nCri.MC.No. 6698 of 2018 5\nRESPONDENT'S/S EXHIBITS:\nNIL\n//TRUE COPY//\nP.A.TO JUDGE\n\n"
