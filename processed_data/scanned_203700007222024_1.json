M.C. ASHI (PP)\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n23.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nDeere\nB)eReE et\n2024/KER/5269\nCRL.MC 722/2024\n2\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J\neee i ee\nORDER\nPetitioner seeks for the relief of adjournment of the trial in\nS.C.No.582/2017 on the files of the Additional Sessions Court-\nIll, Mavelikkara by six months.\n\n2. Petitioner is CW2 in the above case. Petitioner is in detention\nunder NDPS Act, and he asserts that he will not be able to\ngive proper guidance for the conduct of the case.\n\n3. The prosecution alleges that on 31.01.2014 the accused had\nattacked the defacto complainant and another person and\nthereby committed the offences under Sections 143, 144, 147,\n\n148, 149, 324 and 326 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 apart\nfrom Section 20 r/w Section 27 of the Arms Act, 1959.\n\n4. Petitioner is an accused in several crimes, including three NDPS\ncases, and is now under detention. He contends that he will\nnot be able to conduct the case properly and give proper\n\nBaas\nB)eReE et\n2024/KER/5269\nCRL.MC 722/2024\n3\nassistance to the prosecutor, and therefore, wants an\nadjournment of the trial by six months. It is also submitted\nthat, if the petitioner is permitted to give evidence in the trial,\nafter he is released from detention, he would be able to\neffectively participate in the trial.\n\n5. Having heard Smt.A.Salini Lal, the learned counsel for the\npetitioner, as well as Sri.Ashi.M.C., the learned Public\nProsecutor, I am of the view that the relief sought for by the\npetitioner has no merit.\n\n6. The prosecution is primarily conducted by the prosecutor. The\ninvestigation has already been completed, and all the materials\nrequired for a proper trial have been collected. Though the\npetitioner is an injured and a witness in the case, he can only\nprovide evidence when called upon to do so. Notwithstanding\nthe fact that petitioner is in detention under the NDPS Act, on\nthe date fixed for evidence, necessary arrangements will be\nmade to enable the court to record his evidence. Petitioner\ncannot, at this stage, go around collecting evidence or provide\nany additional material to the prosecutor or to _ the\n\nDeere\nRea Gets 1\nleer\n2024/KER/5269\nCRL.MC_722/2024\n4\n\ninvestigation. Therefore, the contention that the petitioner will\n\nbe able to assist the prosecutor more effectively if he is\n\nreleased from detention and, on that basis, the trial ought to\n\nbe adjourned is highly untenable. Hence, I do not find any\n\nmerit in those contentions, and this Crl.M.C. is dismissed.\n\n7. Notwithstanding the above dismissal, it will be open to the\nprosecutor, if he feels it necessary to make any application for\nadjournment of the trial, to do so.\n\nsd/-\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\nAMV/23/01/2024\n\nBRD\nme ; ae mt d\nleer\n2024/KER/5269\nCRL.MC 7722/2024\n5\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 7722/2024\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES\nANNEXURE 1 COPY OF THE RELEVANT PAGES OF THE FINAL\nREPORT IN CRIME NO: 276/2017 OF\nKAYAMKULAM POLICE STATION WHICH [IS\nPENDING AS S.C NO: 582/17 OF THE ADDL\nSESSIONS COURT-III, MAVELIKKARA.\nANNEXURE 2 COPY OF THE ORDER OF DETENTION DATED\n31/7/23.\nANNEXURE 3 COPY OF THE PETITION FILED BY THE\nPETITIONER DATED 11/1/24.\nANNEXURE 4 COPY OF THE PROCEEDINGS SHEET TAKEN\nFROM E-COURT SERVICES.\nTRUE COPY\n\n"
