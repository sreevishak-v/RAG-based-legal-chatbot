The crime has been registered for the offences\nunder Sections 4 and 5 of the Explosive Substance Act,\n1908.\n\n2. A huge quantity of explosives were seized in this\ncase. According to the petitioner, he had legally procured the\nsaid items through Annexures A5 and A6. Annexure-A5 is\ndated 30.01.2017 by which four boxes of ‘super power 90'\nand one box of 'safety fuse’ were purchased by the petitioner.\nThrough Annexure-A6 the same quantity of materials as is\ncontained in Annexure-A5 were purchased by the petitioner,\non 01.02.2017. Even though these materials were allegedly\npurchased on 30\" day of January and 1“ day of February, the\nsame were allegedly kept there. The seizure was on\n08.09.2017. At present, in the absence of any evidence it\ncannot be believed that the materials were allegedly\npurchased through Annexures A5 and A6. Allegedly, the\nmaterials were not properly kept also.\n\no marl\n2 EA ba\npie ery\nap\n2017/KER/49776\nCrl.M.C. No.7964 of 2017\n= 2:\n\n3.
