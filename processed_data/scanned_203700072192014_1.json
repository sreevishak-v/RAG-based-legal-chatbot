The 274\nrespondent herein is the first informant on whose complaint the\ncrime was registered by the police, and the first respondent is\nhis son, who sustained injuries in the alleged incident of assault.\nThe petitioners are the three accused in the said crime, which is\nnow pending as C.P No.69/2013 before the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate Court, Nilambur. The respondents 1 and 2 have filed\naffidavit to the effect that the whole dispute stands settled\namicably, and that they have no grievance or complaint now. It\nis in fact really doubtful whether the allegations in the case will\ncome under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code as a case of\nattempted murder. Of course it is true that the first respondent\n\n2015/KER/1277\n\nCrl.M.C No.7219 of 2014 2\nhad sustained fracture of his frontal bone in the alleged incident\nof assault. That by itself, will not attract the offence under\nSection 307 of the Indian Penal Code. For such a prosecution on\nthe allegation of attempted murder something strong and\ndefinite is required, but such strong materials are not there.\nAnyway, the dispute now stands amicably settled, and the parties\nhave come to terms. It is submitted that the parties are now on\nquite cordial terms, and the whole dispute between them which\ngave rise to the alleged incident of assault, stands resolved\nforever.\n\n2. In so many decisions the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt has held that even in cases involving non-compoundable\noffences like 307 IPC, the High Court can quash the prosecution;\nbe it at the crime stage, or at the trial stage, or even at the\nappellate or revisional stage, if the parties have really settled the\nwhole dispute, and continuance of prosecution will not serve any\npurpose, or will otherwise cause harm and hardship to parties.\nHere I find a case of true and genuine settlement between the\nparties, and now they are on quite cordial terms. In such a\nsituation, continuance of the prosecution will not serve any\npurpose, and it may even cause harm and embarrassment to\n\nBLE\n2015/KER/1277\nCrl.M.C No.7219 of 2014 3\nboth the parties. In such a situation, the prosecution can be\nquashed.\nIn the result, this Criminal Miscellaneous Case is\n\nallowed. The prosecution against the petitioners herein in C.C\nNo.892/2012 of the Nilambur Police Station, now pending as\ncommittal proceeding in C.P No.69/2013 before the Judicial First\nClass Magistrate Court, Nilambur, will stand quashed under\nSection 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Accordingly, the\npetitioners will stand released from prosecution, and the bail\nbond, if any, executed by them will stand discharged.\n\nP.UBAID\n\nJUDGE\nab\n\n"
