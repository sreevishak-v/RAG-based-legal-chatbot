CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON\n25.11.2019, THE COURT ON 06.01.2020 PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nEel\nCrl.MC.No.8945 OF 2018 (G) 2020/KER/288\n2\nR. NARAYANA PISHARADTI, J\nCril.M.C No.8945 of 2018\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner is the first accused in the case registered as C.R\nNo. 14/2004 of the Kodungalloor Excise Range.\n\n2. The offences alleged against the petitioner are punishable\nunder Sections 55(a) and 58 of the Abkari Act, 1077.\n\n3. The prosecution case is as follows: On 06.07.2004, the\nExcise Circle Inspector, Vadanappally conducted search of the house\nwhich was taken on rent by the first accused and seized 5206.500\nlitres of Indian Made Foreign Liquor of different brands from there.\nInvestigation of the case revealed that it was the second accused who\nhad brought the liquor to the aforesaid house and that the third\naccused had transported the liquor.\n\n4. After completing the investigation of the case, chargesheet\nwas filed against the three accused for the offences punishable under\nSections 55(a) and 58 of the Abkari Act. The second and the third\naccused faced trial in the case S.C No. 204/2008 before the Additional\nAssistant Sessions Judge, Thirssur. As per Annexure-B judgment, the\n\neee\n\nCrl.MC.No.8945 OF 2018 (G) 2020/KER/288\n3\n\nlearned Additional Assistant Sessions Judge found the second and the\nthird accused not guilty of the offences alleged against them and\nacquitted them. The petitioner, who is the first accused, was\nabsconding and he had not faced trial and the case against him was\nsplit up and refiled as S.C No. 467/2015.\n\n5. This petition is filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C for quashing\nthe proceedings against the petitioner in the case S.C No. 467/2015\non the ground that the entire substratum of the prosecution case has\nbeen lost by virtue of Annexure-B judgment.\n\n6. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned\nPublic Prosecutor.\n\n7. Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the\nsecond and the third accused who faced trial in S.C No. 204/2008\nwere acquitted not merely on the basis of insufficiency of evidence\nagainst them or the infirmities in the evidence adduced by the\nprosecution against them, but also on the ground that the officer who\nconducted the investigation of the case had no authority to do it.\nLearned counsel for the petitioner would contend that, even if the trial\nagainst the petitioner is conducted, the same situation will prevail and\ntherefore, continuation of the prosecution of the petitioner would be a\nfutile exercise.\n\n8. Learned Public Prosecutor has submitted that the State has\n\nerie\n-\nBle Sere\nCr1.MC.No.8945 OF 2018 (G) 2020/KER/288\n4\nnot filed any appeal against Annexure-B judgment.\n\n9. Ona perusal of Annexure-B judgment, it is seen that one of\nthe grounds for acquittal of the second and the third accused, who\nfaced trial in that case, was the incompetency of the officer who\nconducted the investigation of the case. It is stated by the trial court\nin Annexure-B judgment as follows:\n\n“ The learned counsel for the accused argued that PW1\nwho was the circle inspector of excise, Vadanappally has\nno jurisdiction at all for registering this case and to\nconduct investigation as well as in filing the chargesheet.\nIn the circumstances the learned counsel for the accused\nnumber 1 argued that the charge itself is not\nmaintainable. In this case PW1 has no territorial\njurisdiction within the jurisdiction of Kodungalloor range.\nThere is a separate circle inspector of excise for the\nKodungalloor range. The party of the circle inspector,\nKodungalloor was with PW1, but that will not in any way\nhelp the prosecution to overcome this important aspect.\nThe learned counsel for the accused was relying on the\njudgment of Honourable High Court in Rajan A.N v. State\nof Kerala (2014 (2) KLD 468) and also on the judgment\nin Hamsa Koya v. State of Kerala (2015 (2) KLT SN 25\n(case number 35). In these decisions the Honourable\nHigh Court of Kerala made it clear that if the officer\nhaving no jurisdiction over the area conducted\ninvestigation and laid chargesheet then the cognizance\ntaken by the court was against the mandate contained in\nSection 50 of Kerala Abkari Act. It was held that court\nhad no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the offence\n\nerie\n-\nBs ere\nCrl.MC.No.8945 OF 2018 (G) 2020/KER288\n5\nalleged in the complaint filed based on such\ninvestigation. Even the direction of Assistant Excise\nCommissioner will not confer any power on PW1 in\nconducting investigation and filing of chargesheet. Only\nby a notification of government it is possible to\nconfer/powers on circle inspector of Vadanappally to act\nas Abkari Officer with respect to an offence committed\nwithin the jurisdiction of Kodungalloor range office. So\non that ground itself this prosecution will fail.”\n\n10. It is now well settled that investigation of an offence under\nthe Abkari Act can be done only by an Abkari Officer as defined under\nthe Act. An officer who has no jurisdiction over the place where the\noccurrence took place has no authority to conduct the investigation of\nthe case. Authority to conduct the investigation in such a case cannot\nalso be delegated to such an officer by a superior officer (See\nKunhanna Poojari v. State of Kerala: 2019(4) KHC (292)).\n\n11. In the aforesaid circumstances, even if the prosecution\nagainst the petitioner is continued and trial against him is conducted,\nit would only be a futile exercise resulting in waste of judicial time. I\nam of the view that this is a case where the substratum of the\nprosecution case has been lost by virtue of Annexure-B judgment.\nTherefore, the proceedings against the petitioner are liable to be\nquashed",
