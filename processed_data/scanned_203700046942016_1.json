M.C. No.4694 of 2016\nDated this the 3 day of August, 2016\nORDER\n1.The petitioner herein is the 1 accused in S.C.\nNo.180 of 2015 of the Additional Sessions Court,\n(Fast Track) III, Manjeri. He is charged for having\ncommitted offence punishable under Sections 341,\n324 and 307 read with Section 34 of I.P.C.\n2.As directed by this Court by Annexure-A2 order, the\npetitioner had surrendered before the learned\nMagistrate and he was granted bail subject to\nconditions. Among other conditions , the petitioner\nwas also directed to produce his passport before the\ncourt below.\n3.The petitioner is running a grocery business in the\nUnited Arab Emirates and in the said circumstances,\n\n2016/KER/33886\nCrl. M.C. No.4694 of 2016 -2-\nhe filed an application before the learned Sessions\nJudge seeking release of the passport to travel\nabroad for a period of six months. The said\napplication was allowed in part . The conditions\nimposed are extracted below for easy reference.\n\n2. The passport produced by the\npetitioner in the above case is\nreleased to him for a period of 6\nmonths from today, on executing a\nbond for the same with two solvent\nsureties for an amount of\nRs.2,00,000/- (Rupees two lakhs\nonly) each.\n\n3. The passport shall be released to the\npetitioner on executing a bond as\naforementioned and getting a proper\nacknowledge for the same.\n\n4. It is directed that, the accused\nNo.1/petitioner shall not leave the\nterritory of India by using the existing\npassport or with the renewed\npassport, without the consent of this\nCourt.\n\n5. The petitioner is directed to produce\nthe renewed passport before this\nCourt within 10 days from the date of\nreceipt of the same _ from the\ncompetent authorities.\n\nBlick\n2016/KER/33886\n\nCri. M.C. No.4694 of 2016 -3-\n\n4.Heard the learned Counsel appearing for the\npetitioner and learned Public Prosecutor.\n\n5.The petitioner, it appears, is aggrieved by some of\nthe passing references made by the _ learned\nAdditional Sessions Judge in the impugned order. It\nis observed by the court below that the petitioner\ncannot be permitted to go abroad as he did seek to\nmodify the conditions imposed by the Magistrate. It\nis also submitted that the directions that the\npetitioner should execute a bond for two solvent\nsureties for an amount of Rs.2 lakhs surety is\nonerous. The learned counsel prays that the\npetitioner be permitted to travel abroad for a period\nof six months at least in order to enable him to take\ncare of his business abroad. Much reliance is placed\nby the learned Counsel on the order of this Court in\nS.K.Asok Kumar V State of Kerala 2009 (2) KLT\n712 to advance his contentions.\n\nBlick\n2016/KER/33886\n\nCri. M.C. No.4694 of 2016 -4-\n\n6.The learned Public Prosecutor on the other hand,\nsubmitted that the petitioner is involved in a grave\noffence and it was after considering the various\ninputs that the learned Additional Sessions Judge\nhad imposed the aforesaid conditions. It is\nsubmitted that the petitioner can always approach\nthe learned Sessions Judge and seek permission to\ntravel abroad and nothing in the Annexure A5 order\nprevents him from doing the same.\n\n7.1 have considered the rival submissions. The\nlikelihood of the case coming up for trial in the near\nfuture is very remote. The period sought for by the\npetitioner to travel abroad is for 6 months. The\nmere fact that the petitioner had not challenged the\norder passed by the learned Magistrate is not\nsufficient reason to deny him permission to travel\nabroad. However, the bond amount imposed by the\nCourt below cannot be said to be onerous.\n\n2016/KER/33886\nCrl. M.C. No.4694 of 2016 -5-\n8.Having regard to the facts and circumstances, I\ndirect the learned Sessions Judge to_- grant\npermission to the petitioner to travel abroad for a\nperiod of six months. The petitioner shall execute\nthe necessary bond before the Court below for the\namount ordered and the court may also impose\nnecessary conditions to ensure his presence before\nthe court at the stage of trial.\nPetition is allowed as above.\nSd/-\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN V.\nJUDGE\nSKV\n\n"
