The second respondent is the wife of the first\npetitioner and the second petitioner is the mother of\nthe first petitioner. The marital discordancy between\nthe first petitioner and the de facto complainant\nculminated in criminal prosecution for the offence\npunishable under Section 498A of the IPC and\nAnnexure-A final report has been filed before the\ntrial court.

As non-compoundable\noffences are incorporated, even though the parties\nhave settled their dispute amicably, the criminal\nproceedings cannot be put to an end. In such\ncircumstance, the petitioners filed this Crl.M.C.\nseeking an order quashing the entire criminal\nprosecution under Annexure-A final report, invoking\nthe inherent power under Section 482 of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure, in view of the decision laid down\n\nby the Apex Court in Gian Singh V.

The position that emerges from the above\ndiscussion can be summarised thus: the power of the\nHigh Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR.\nor complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is\ndistinct and different from the power given to a criminal\ncourt for compounding the offences under S.320 of the\nCode. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no\nstatutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord\nwith the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to\nsecure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the\nprocess of any Court. In what cases power to quash the\ncriminal proceeding or complaint or FIR. may be\nexercised where the offender and victim have settled\ntheir dispute would depend on the facts and\ncircumstances of each case and no category can be\nprescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the\nHigh Court must have due regard to the nature and\ngravity of the crime.

The position that emerges from the above\ndiscussion can be summarised thus: the power of the\nHigh Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR.\nor complaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is\ndistinct and different from the power given to a criminal\ncourt for compounding the offences under S.320 of the\nCode. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no\nstatutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord\nwith the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to\nsecure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the\nprocess of any Court. In what cases power to quash the\ncriminal proceeding or complaint or FIR. may be\nexercised where the offender and victim have settled\ntheir dispute would depend on the facts and\ncircumstances of each case and no category can be\nprescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the\nHigh Court must have due regard to the nature and\ngravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of\nmental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity,\netc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim\nor victim's family and the offender have settled the\ndispute. Such offences are not private in nature and\nhave serious impact on society. Similarly, any\ncompromise between the victim and offender in relation\nto the offences under special statutes like Prevention of\nCorruption Act or the offences committed by public\nservants while working in that capacity etc; cannot\n\nBae sel\na\n2015/KER/17255\nCrl.M.C.2254/15-B 25:\nprovide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings\ninvolving such offences. But the criminal cases having\noverwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour\nstand on different footing for the purposes of quashing,\nparticularly the offences arising from commercial,\nfinancial, mercantile, civil, partnership or such like\ntransactions or the offences arising out of matrimony\nrelating to dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the\nwrong is basically private or personal in nature and the\nparties have resolved their entire dispute. In this\ncategory of cases, High Court may quash criminal\nproceedings if in its view, because of the compromise\nbetween the offender and victim, the possibility of\nconviction is remote and bleak and continuation of\ncriminal case would put accused to great oppression and\nprejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him\nby not quashing the criminal case despite full and\ncomplete settlement and compromise with the victim. In\nother words, the High Court must consider whether it\nwould be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to\ncontinue with the criminal proceeding or continuation\nof the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse\nof process of law despite settlement and compromise\nbetween the victim and wrongdoer and whether to\nsecure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal\ncase is put fo an end and if the answer to the above\nquestion(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well\nwithin its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding.”\n\n=\nbeer eee\n2015/KER/17255\nCrl.M.C.2254/15-B :6:\n\n6. In view of the proposition laid down above, the\nquestion to be considered, in the instant case, is,\nwhether the non-compoundable offence involved in\nthis case can be compounded, in the exercise of the\ninherent power under Section 482 of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure. Prima facie, I find that the\noffences alleged against the petitioners will not\ncome under the category of non-compoundable\noffences, which are specifically excluded from\ncomposition, in the exercise of inherent power under\nSec.482 of the Cr.P.C. Going by the affidavit filed by\nthe de facto complainant, it is seen that the dispute\nbetween the accused and the victim had been amicably\nsettled and at present the de facto complainant has\nno subsisting grievance at all. The de facto\ncomplainant does not want to proceed with\nprosecution against the accused. Full and final\nsettlement and compromise with the victim are\nevidenced by Annexure-B. In view of the compromise\n\nlee ae\n2015/KER/17255\n\nCrl.M.C.2254/15-B 7:\n\nbetween the petitioners and the victim, I find that the\npossibility of conviction is remote, bleak, and\ncontinuation of the criminal case would put the\nparties to great oppression, prejudice and also\ntantamount to abuse of the process of the court. The\npresent criminal prosecution against the accused\nmust be put to an end to secure the interest of\njustice.\n\n7. In this analysis, the prosecution proceedings\nagainst the petitioners under Annexure-A final\nreport will stand quashed in the exercise of\njurisdiction and power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.\n\nThis petition is allowed.\n\nSd/-\n(K.HARILAL, JUDGE)\nokb.\n\n"
