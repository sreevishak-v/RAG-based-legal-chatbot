Bhargavan\n\nBB Bhvan Near Pakalkuri LPS\n\nPallickal Village Thiruvananthapuram\n\nBy Advocate:- ZareenaR\nCounter Petitioner :-\n\nSub Inspector of Police\nPallickal Police Station\nBy Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumari\nThis Criminal M.C. is coming on for hearing on 03.03.2025 and the court\non 04.03.2025 passed the following ::\nORDER\n\nThis is an application filed by the sole accused in the above crime under\nSection 483 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking regular bail.\n\n2. The petitioner/accused is alleged to have committed the offences\npunishable under Sections 296(b), 118(1), 126(2), 124(1) and 109(1) of the\nBharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.\n\n3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- The accused is\nthe husband of the defacto complainant. On 30.01.2023, the accused attempted\n\n2\n\nto commit murder of the defacto complainant and her daughter by pouring\npetrol over their body and by setting them fire. A case was registered in this\nregard as Crime No. 105/2023 of Pallickal Police Station, registered for the\noffences punishable u/ss. 294(b), 506, 511 of 436 and 308 of Indian Penal\nCode. Due to this animosity, on 10.01.2025 at about 7 p.m., the accused\nentered into the hall room of the house of the victim, situated in Pallickal\nVillage and uttered abusive words against her, caught hold of her hair and\nforcefully poured acid into her mouth. As a result, the acid fell on the face,\nlips, nose and back of the victim, causing grievous burn injuries.\n\n4. Reportedly, the petitioner/ accused was arrested on 11.01.2025 and\nhe is in custody since then.\n\n5. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The\nInvestigating Officer filed report opposing the bail application.\n\n6. Heard. Perused the records.\n\n7. The only point to be considered is, whether regular bail can be\ngranted to the petitioner/ accused.\n\n8. The Point:- The petitioner/accused is the husband of the defacto\ncomplainant. It is alleged that, the petiitoner/accused had attempted to cause\ndeath of his wife by pouring acid. The motive for the alleged incident is the\nanimosity that arose when the defacto complainant filed a complaint before the\npolice when the accused attempted to kill her and her daughter.\n\n3\n\n9. According to the petitioner, he is innocent of the allegations\nlevelled against him. It is submitted by the petitioner that, the injuries are simple\nin nature and it only attracts the offences punishable u/ss. 118(1) and 124(2) of\nBharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, and Section 109(1) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita is not\nattracted in this case.\n\n10. The magnitude of the offence alleged is grave. Allegedly, the\npetitioner/accused had poured acid into the mouth of his wife/defacto\ncomplainant. Reportedly, the defacto complainant/victim had sustained burn\ninjuries in the incident. The certificate of examination by the Medical Officer\nshows that burns are seen on the right upper chest and axilla. It is seen that the\ndying declaration of the victim was also recorded from Medical College\nHospital, Thiruvananthapuram. So the prosecution has made out the prima\nfacie case against the petitioner and the involvement of the petitioner / accused\nin the alleged offence. The learned Public Prosecutor strongly opposed the bail\napplication stating that the petitioner is having great animosity against the\ndefacto complainant and he is following her to do away her, and so releasing\nthe petitioner on bail would be a threat to the defacto complainant. In the\ndying declaration appended along with the report, it is seen that the victim had\ngiven statement to that effect. It is stated in the report that the petitioner is\ninvolved in five other crimes. The investigation in this case is progressing.\nThe petitioner / accused is in judicial custody only for a period of 52 days. If\n\n4\nthe petitioner/ accused is released on bail at this stage, he is likely to influence\nor intimidate the victim and the other witnesses and tamper with the evidence.\nThe chance of absconding also cannot be ruled out. So, the investigation will\nbe adversely affected. Considering all the afore facts, including the gravity of\nthe offence, this court is not inclined to release the petitioner on bail at this\nstage.\nIn the result, this petition is dismissed.\n(Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected\nand pronounced by me in Open Court on this the 4\" day of March 2025)\nNAZEERA S.\nSESSIONS JUDGE\nCopies (4)\nTyped by : Manjusha\nComp by : Rifa\nFCS :\n\n5\nFair Copy of order in\nCrl.M.C.
