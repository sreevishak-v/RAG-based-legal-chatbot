CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON\n08.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\neae\nCr1.MC.No.5259 OF 2015 2021/KER/1231\n3\nORDER\nDated this the 8% day of January 2021\n\nPetitioners are accused numbers 1 to 5 in a\nprivate complaint filed by the 2 respondent\nbefore the Judicial First Class Magistrate court,\nIdukki. Annexure III is the private complaint\nfiled by the 2\" respondent. Annexure IV is the\norder taking cognizance of the offence.\n\n2. The case of the 2™ respondent is that due\nto some previous enmity, on 14.02.2013, the 1**\naccused along with other accused wrongfully\nrestrained the defacto complainant while he was\ntravelling in a Tipper Lorry and assaulted the\nhusband of the complainant. In connection with\nthe above incident Crime No.115/2013 was\nregistered by Idukki Police alleging offences\npunishable under Sections 341, 323, 324, 430\n506(i) read with Section 34 of the IPC. The\noffence under Section 3 (1)(X) of the SC/ST\n(Prevention of Atrocities) Act was also alleged.\n\neae\nCr1.MC.No.5259 OF 2015 2021/KER/1231\n4\n\nAfter conducting a full fledged investigation, the\nPolice referred the case as per Annexure I refer\nreport. Thereafter, Annexure III complaint was\nfiled and the learned Magistrate taken on file the\nsame as C.P.No.12/2015 for the offences interalia\nunder Section 3(1)(X) of the SC/ST (PA) Act.\n\n3. This Cr1.M.C. is filed to quash the entire\nproceedings in C.P.No.12/2015 on the file of the\nJudicial First Class Magistrate court, Idukki.\n\n4. Heard the learned counsel for the\npetitioner and the 2™ respondent. Heard the\nlearned Public Prosecutor also.\n\n5. The learned counsel for the petitioners\nsubmitted that the continuatin of Annexure III\nbased on Annexure IV proceedings is an abuse of\nprocess of court. According to the learned\ncounsel, the husband of the 2° respondent was an\naccused in Crime No.95/2013 of Idukki Police\nStation. That is the main case and the present\ncase is the counter case to that case. The\nhusband of the 2\" respondent faced trial before\n\nBleed\nCr1.MC.No.5259 OF 2015 2021U/KER/231\n5\nthe Second Additional Sessions Judge in\nS.C.No.322/2013. He was convicted by the trial\ncourt as per judgment dated 29.10.2014 in\nS.C.No.322/2013. Annexur II is the judgment. The\nlearned counsel submitted that after the\nacquittal, the present counter case is filed by\nthe 2™° respondent on 12.05.2015. According to\nthe counsel, the place of occurrence and time are\nsame in Crime No.95/2013 and in Annexure III\nprivate complaint. Therefore, it is a case and\ncounter case. The learned counsel submitted that\nAnnexure III private complaint is time barred. It\nis also contended that the principles laid down by\nthe Apex Court in Sudir.v. State of M.P.2001 (1) KLT\n682 is flouted in this case. More over, the\nlearned counsel also submitted that while taking\ncognizance of the offence by the learned\nMagistrate as per Annexure IV order, Annexure I\nrefer report is not considered. The learned\ncounsel relied the judgments of this Court in\nKader _v. State of Kerala 1999(3)KELT 55 and\n\neae\nCr1.MC.No.5259 OF 2015 2021/KER/1231\n6\nParameswaran Nair v. Surendran 2009 (1) KLT 794.\nThe learned counsel also submitted that the\nlearned Magistrate taken on file the case as per\nAnnexure IV order under Section 3(1) (X) SC/ST(PA)\nAct also. The learned counsel submitted that this\nis an offence exclusively triable by the Special\nCourt. Therefore, according to the counsel, the\nlearned Magistrate ought to have examined all the\nwitnesses cited in the complaint as per proviso to\nSection 202 Cr.P.C. The learned counsel submitted\nthat Annexure III and IV proceedings are abuse of\nprocess of court and the continuation of the same\nis unnecessary in the facts and circumstances of\nthe case.\n\n6. The learned counsel for the 2™* respondent\nsubmitted that this is not a case in which this\nCourt has to invoke the powers under Section 482\nCr.P.C. According to the learned counsel, the\nprotest complaint was filed immediately after the\nrefer report was filed before the court. The\nlearned counsel submitted that there is absolutely\n\neae\nCr1.MC.No.5259 OF 2015 2021/KER/1231\n7\nno delay in filing the protest complaint. The\nlearned counsel submitted that he may be given an\nopportunity to adduce evidence before the lower\ncourt.\n\n7. The learned Public Prosecutor submitted\nthat the Police after investigation submitted a\nrefer report.\n\n8. It is an admitted fact that the Crime\nNumber 95/2013 and Crime Number 115/2013 of Idukki\nPolice Station are case and counter case. The\nhusband of the 2° respondent is the accused in\nCrime No.95/2013. The witnesses in Crime\nNo.95/2013 are the close relatives of the\npetitioners. It is a settled position that the\ncase and the counter case should be tried\nsimultaneously one after another. This point is\nconsidered by the Apex Court in _Sudir.v. State of\nM.P.2001(1)KLT 682. The relevant paragraph in the\nabove case is extracted here under:\n\n“9. It is a salutary practice, when two criminal\n\ncases relate to the same incident, they are tried and\n\ndisposed of by the same court by pronouncing\n\njudgments on the same day. Such two different\nversions of the same incident resulting in two\n\nues\nCr1.MC.No.5259 OF 2015 2021/KER/1231\n8\ncriminal cases are compendiously called \"case and\ncounter case\" by some High Courts and \"cross cases\"\nby some other High Courts. Way back in nineteen\nhundred and twenties a Division Bench of the Madras\nHigh Court (Waller, and Cornish, JJ) made a\nsuggestion (In Re Goriparthi Krishtamma - 1929 Madras\nWeekly Notes 881) that \"a case and counter case\narising out of the same affair should always, if\npracticable, be tried by the same court; and each\nparty would represent themseives as having been the\ninnocent victims of the aggression of the other.\"\n10. Close to its heels Jackson, oJ, made an\nexhortation to the then Legislature to provide a\nmechanism as a statutory provision for trial of both\ncases by the same court (vide Krishna Pannadi vs.\nEmperor ATR 1930 Mad.190). The learned judge said\nthus:\n\"There is no clear law as regards the procedure in\ncounter cases, a defect which the Legislature ought\nto remedy. It is a generally recognized rule that\nsuch cases should be tried in quick succession by the\nsame Judge, who should not pronounce judgment tiil\nthe hearing of both cases is finished.\"\n11. We are unable to understand why the Legislature\nis still parrying to incorporate such a salubrious\npractice as a statutory requirement in the Code. The\npractical reasons for adopting a procedure that such\ncross cases shali be tried by the same court, can be\nsummarised thus: (1) It staves off the danger of an\naccused being convicted before his whole case is\nbefore the court. (2) It deters conflicting judgments\nbeing delivered upon similar facts; and (3) [In\nreality the case and the counter case are, to ail\nintents and purposes, different or conflicting\nversions of one incident.\n12. In fact, many High Courts have reiterated the\nneed to foliow the said practice as a necessary legal\nrequirement for preventing conflicting decisions\nregarding one incident. This court has given its\napproval to the said practice in Nathi Lal & ors. vs.\nState of U.P. & anr. [1990 (Supp) SCC 145]. The\nprocedure to be followed in such a situation has been\nsuccinctly delineated in the said decision and it can\nbe extracted here:\n\"We think that the fair procedure to adopt in a\nmatter like the present where there are cross cases,\nis to direct that the same learned Judge must try\nboth cross cases one after the other. After the\nrecording of evidence in one case is completed, he\n\nue\nCr1.MC.No.5259 OF 2015 2021/KER/1231\nS)\nmust hear the arguments but he must reserve the\njudgment. Thereafter he must proceed to hear the\ncross case and after recording all the evidence he\nmust hear the arguments but reserve the judgment in\nthat case. The same learned Judge must thereafter\ndispose of the matters by two separate judgments. In\ndeciding each of the cases, he can rely only on the\nevidence recorded in that particular case. The\nevidence recorded in the cross cannot be looked into.\nNor can the judge be influenced by whatever is argued\nin the cross case. Each case must be decided on the\nbasis of the evidence which has been placed on record\nin that particular case without being influenced in\nany manner by the evidence or arguments urged in the\ncross case. But both the judgments must be pronounced\nby the same learned Judge one after the other.\"\n13. How to implement the said scheme in a situation\nwhere one of the two cases (relating to the same\nincident) is charge-sheeted or complained of,\ninvolves offences or offence exclusively triable by a\nCourt of Sessions, but none of the offences involved\nin the other case is exclusively triable by the\nSessions Court. The magistrate before whom the former\ncase reaches has no escape from committing the case\nto the Sessions Court as provided in Section 209 of\nthe Code. Once the said case is committed to the\nSessions Court, thereafter it is governed by the\nprovisions submitted in Chapter XVIII of the Code.\nThough, the next case cannot be committed in\naccordance with Section 209 of the Code, the\nmagistrate has, nevertheless, power to commit the\ncase to the court of Sessions, albeit none of the\noffences involved therein is exclusively triable by\nthe Sessions Court. Section 323 is incorporated in\nthe Code to meet similar cases also. That section\nreads thus:\n\"Tf, in any inguiry into an offence or a trial\nbefore a Magistrate, it appears to him at any stage\nof the proceedings before signing judgment that the\ncase is one which ought to be tried by the Court of\nSession, he shall commit it to that Court under the\nprovisions hereinbefore contained and thereupon the\nprovisions of chapter XVIII shail apply to the\ncommitment so made.\"\n14. The above section does not make an inroad into\nSection 209 because the former is intended to cover\ncases to which Section 209 does not apply. When a\nmagistrate has committed a case on account of his\nlegislative compulsion by Section 209, its cross\ncase, having no offence exclusively triable by the\nSessions Court, must appear to the magistrate as one\n\nPeel\n\nUe\n\naoe H\n\nCr1.MC.No.5259 OF 2015 2021/KER/1231\n10\n\nwhich ought to be tried by the same Court of\n\nSessions. We have already adverted to the sturdy\n\nreasons as to why it should be so. Hence, the\n\nmagistrate can exercise the special power conferred\n\non him by virtue of Section 323 of the Code when he\n\ncommits the cross case aliso to the Court of\n\nSessions. Commitment under Section 209 and 323 might\n\nbe through two different channels, but once they are\n\ncommitted their subsequent flow could only be\n\nthrough the stream channelised by the provisions\n\ncontained in Chapter XVIII.”\n\n9. Admittedly, the main case which is Crime\nNo.95/2013 concluded as per Annexure II judgment\nin which the husband of the 2nd respondent is\nalready convicted and sentenced. Therefore, there\nis no chance for a simulteneous trial of Annexure\nIII complaint and Crime No.95/2013. Hence the\ncontinuation of Annexure III will definitely\nprejudice the interest of the petitioners/accused.\n\n10. Annexure IV is the order by which learned\nMagistrate taken oon file as C.P.No.12/2015.\nAnnexure IV order is extracted hereunder:\n\n“Heard. Perused the records and statement of\n\nwitness u/s 202, I am of the opinion that this is\n\nsufficient to proceed against the accused. Hence\n\nthe complaint is taken on file as C.P.No.12/15 for\n\nthe offence punishable u/s 323, 324, 308, 506(i)\n\nr/w 34 IPC 3(1) (xX) of SC/ST (Prevention of\n\nAtrocities)Act 1989. Take steps to issue summons.\n\nReturn of summons — 30.6.15.%\n\neae\nCr1.MC.No.5259 OF 2015 2021/KER/1231\n11\n\n11. A perusal of the above order will show\nthat there is nothing to show that the learned\nMagistrate considered Annexure I refer report\nwhile taking cognizance of the above offences.\nThis Court in Kader v. State of Kerala 1999(3)KLT\n55 observed like this:\n\n“7. The Court noted that the scope of enquiry\n\nunder §.202 is the ascertainment of the truth or\n\nfalsity of the allegations made in the complaint on\n\nthe materials placed by the complainant before the\n\nCourt for the limited purpose of finding out\n\nwhether the prima facie case for issue of process\n\nhas been made out and for deciding the question\n\npurely from the point of view of the complainant\n\nwithout at ali adverting to any defence that the\n\naccused may have. Nevertheless, the Court has a\n\nduty to protect the interest of the absent accused\n\nalso because at the particular stage, the accused\n\nhas no say in the matter and the matter is decided\n\nwithout notice to him. Tt is, therefore, open to\n\nthe Magistrate to scrutinise carefully the\n\nallegations made in the complaint with a view to\n\nprevent the accused therein from being called upon\n\nto face obviously frivolous complaint and to find\n\nwhat material there is to support the allegations\n\nmade in the complaint. The Magistrate has a duty\n\nnot only to bring to book a person or persons\n\nagainst whom grave allegations are made in the\n\ncomplaint but also to protect the interest of the\n\nabsent accused in such matters. What all should\n\ntake cognizance of the offence, will depend upon\n\nthe facts and circumstances of each case. He has\n\nnecessarily to consider the allegations made in the\n\ncomplaint and the statement of the complainant\n\nrecorded under S$.200 Cr.P.C as aiso of the\n\nwitnesses examined under S§.202 of the Cr.P.C.\n\nAlong with that, he has also to consider the result\n\nof enguiry or investigation, if any, held by the\n\npolice. It cannot be said that the said data is\n\nnot an essential factor. The consideration of the\n\nmaterials under §.202 of the Cr.P.C. is not an\n\nempty formality and cannot be done in a perfunctory\n\nor mechanical manner or by adopting a superficial\n\napproach.”\n\nfoe\nBint: 42\n2021/KER/1231\nCr1.MC.No.5259 OF 2015 /\n12\n\n12. Similarly in Parameswaran Nair Vv.\nSurendran 2009 (1) KLT 794, this Court observed\nlike this:\n\n“12. If the original complaint stood dismissed by\nthe acceptance of the refer report submitted after\ninvestigation the protest complaint if any filed\ncan only be treated as a second complaint. If so,\nthe protest complaint will lie only if there was a\nmanifest error or manifest miscarriage of justice\nin the earlier order or new facts which the\ncomplainant had no knowledge of or with reasonable\ndiligence could not have brought forward in the\nprevious proceedings is adduced. When this is the\nlegal position, it is not lawful to the Magistrate\nto ignore the final report submitted by the Police\nunder Section 173(2) of the Code. Magistrate is\nbound to consider the final report and decide\nwhich of the options available to him is to be\nexercised.”\n\n13. In the light of the above decisions,\naccording to me Annexure IV order is\nunsustainable. As I said earlier there is nothing\nto show in Annexure IV order to the effect that\nthe learned Magistrate considered Annexure I refer\nreport while passing that order. Therefore,\nAnnexure IV order is unsustainable.\n\n14. Then the next question is what is the\npurpose in remanding this matter to the lower\ncourt. Admittely, the main case is already\ndisposed by the learned Sessions Judge as per\n\nce\nCr1.MC.No.5259 OF 2015 2021U/KER/231\n13\n\nAnnexure II judgment. Therefore, there cannot be\na simultaneous trial as held by the Apex Court in\nSudir's case (Supra). Hence, there is no purpose\nin remanding this matter to the learned\nMagistrate. Moreover, the petitioners will be\nprejudiced if Annexure III is proceeded because\nthe main case is already disposed as evident by\nAnnexure II Judgment. Moreover, proviso to\nSection 202 Cr.P.C. says that if it appears to the\nMagistrate that the offence committed is triable\nexclusively by the court of Sessions, he shall\ncall up on the complainant to produce all his\nwitnesses and examine them. Admittedly, there are\nfive witnesses mentioned in Annexure III\ncomplaint. It is an admitted fact that only four\nwitnesses were examined before the learned\nMagistrate in Section 202 Cr.P.C. enquiry. On\nthat ground also the order is unsustainable.\n\n15. The alleged incident in this case happened\non 14.02.2013. The Police after investigation\nsubmitted Annexure I refer report on 14.05.2015.\n\nfone\neae\nCr1.MC.No.5259 OF 2015 2021U/KER/231\n14\n\nThereafter, the main case was disposed by the\nlearned Sessions Judge on 29.10.2014. Thereafter\nAnnexure III complaint was filed on 12.05.2015.\nAccording to me the continuation of Annexures III\nand IV proceedings is an abuse of process of court\nin the light of the facts and circumstances of\nthis case and also for the reasons mentioned\nabove.\n\nTherefore, this Cr1l.M.C. is allowed and all\nfurther proceedings in C.P.No.12/2015 on the file\nof the Judicial First Class Magistrate court,\nIdukki are quashed",

That is the main case and the present\ncase is the counter case to that case. The\nhusband of the 2\" respondent faced trial before\n\nBleed\nCr1.MC.No.5259 OF 2015 2021U/KER/231\n5\nthe Second Additional Sessions Judge in\nS.C.No.322/2013. He was convicted by the trial\ncourt as per judgment dated 29.10.2014 in\nS.C.No.322/2013. Annexur II is the judgment. The\nlearned counsel submitted that after the\nacquittal, the present counter case is filed by\nthe 2™° respondent on 12.05.2015. According to\nthe counsel, the place of occurrence and time are\nsame in Crime No.95/2013 and in Annexure III\nprivate complaint. Therefore, it is a case and\ncounter case. The learned counsel submitted that\nAnnexure III private complaint is time barred. It\nis also contended that the principles laid down by\nthe Apex Court in Sudir.v. State of M.P.2001 (1) KLT\n682 is flouted in this case. More over, the\nlearned counsel also submitted that while taking\ncognizance of the offence by the learned\nMagistrate as per Annexure IV order, Annexure I\nrefer report is not considered. The learned\ncounsel relied the judgments of this Court in\nKader _v. State of Kerala 1999(3)KELT 55 and\n\neae\nCr1.MC.No.5259 OF 2015 2021/KER/1231\n6\nParameswaran Nair v. Surendran 2009 (1) KLT 794.\nThe learned counsel also submitted that the\nlearned Magistrate taken on file the case as per\nAnnexure IV order under Section 3(1) (X) SC/ST(PA)\nAct also. The learned counsel submitted that this\nis an offence exclusively triable by the Special\nCourt. Therefore, according to the counsel, the\nlearned Magistrate ought to have examined all the\nwitnesses cited in the complaint as per proviso to\nSection 202 Cr.P.C. The learned counsel submitted\nthat Annexure III and IV proceedings are abuse of\nprocess of court and the continuation of the same\nis unnecessary in the facts and circumstances of\nthe case.\n\n6. The learned counsel for the 2™* respondent\nsubmitted that this is not a case in which this\nCourt has to invoke the powers under Section 482\nCr.P.C. According to the learned counsel, the\nprotest complaint was filed immediately after the\nrefer report was filed before the court. The\nlearned counsel submitted that there is absolutely\n\neae\nCr1.MC.No.5259 OF 2015 2021/KER/1231\n7\nno delay in filing the protest complaint. The\nlearned counsel submitted that he may be given an\nopportunity to adduce evidence before the lower\ncourt.\n\n7. The learned Public Prosecutor submitted\nthat the Police after investigation submitted a\nrefer report.\n\n8. It is an admitted fact that the Crime\nNumber 95/2013 and Crime Number 115/2013 of Idukki\nPolice Station are case and counter case. The\nhusband of the 2° respondent is the accused in\nCrime No.95/2013. The witnesses in Crime\nNo.95/2013 are the close relatives of the\npetitioners. It is a settled position that the\ncase and the counter case should be tried\nsimultaneously one after another. This point is\nconsidered by the Apex Court in _Sudir.v. State of\nM.P.2001(1)KLT 682. The relevant paragraph in the\nabove case is extracted here under:\n\n“9. It is a salutary practice, when two criminal\n\ncases relate to the same incident, they are tried and\n\ndisposed of by the same court by pronouncing\n\njudgments on the same day. Such two different\nversions of the same incident resulting in two\n\nues\nCr1.MC.No.5259 OF 2015 2021/KER/1231\n8\ncriminal cases are compendiously called \"case and\ncounter case\" by some High Courts and \"cross cases\"\nby some other High Courts. Way back in nineteen\nhundred and twenties a Division Bench of the Madras\nHigh Court (Waller, and Cornish, JJ) made a\nsuggestion (In Re Goriparthi Krishtamma - 1929 Madras\nWeekly Notes 881) that \"a case and counter case\narising out of the same affair should always, if\npracticable, be tried by the same court; and each\nparty would represent themseives as having been the\ninnocent victims of the aggression of the other.\"\n10. Close to its heels Jackson, oJ, made an\nexhortation to the then Legislature to provide a\nmechanism as a statutory provision for trial of both\ncases by the same court (vide Krishna Pannadi vs.\nEmperor ATR 1930 Mad.190). The learned judge said\nthus:\n\"There is no clear law as regards the procedure in\ncounter cases, a defect which the Legislature ought\nto remedy. It is a generally recognized rule that\nsuch cases should be tried in quick succession by the\nsame Judge, who should not pronounce judgment tiil\nthe hearing of both cases is finished.\"\n11. We are unable to understand why the Legislature\nis still parrying to incorporate such a salubrious\npractice as a statutory requirement in the Code. The\npractical reasons for adopting a procedure that such\ncross cases shali be tried by the same court, can be\nsummarised thus: (1) It staves off the danger of an\naccused being convicted before his whole case is\nbefore the court. (2) It deters conflicting judgments\nbeing delivered upon similar facts; and (3) [In\nreality the case and the counter case are, to ail\nintents and purposes, different or conflicting\nversions of one incident.\n12. In fact, many High Courts have reiterated the\nneed to foliow the said practice as a necessary legal\nrequirement for preventing conflicting decisions\nregarding one incident. This court has given its\napproval to the said practice in Nathi Lal & ors. vs.\nState of U.P. & anr. [1990 (Supp) SCC 145]. The\nprocedure to be followed in such a situation has been\nsuccinctly delineated in the said decision and it can\nbe extracted here:\n\"We think that the fair procedure to adopt in a\nmatter like the present where there are cross cases,\nis to direct that the same learned Judge must try\nboth cross cases one after the other. After the\nrecording of evidence in one case is completed, he\n\nue\nCr1.MC.No.5259 OF 2015 2021/KER/1231\nS)\nmust hear the arguments but he must reserve the\njudgment. Thereafter he must proceed to hear the\ncross case and after recording all the evidence he\nmust hear the arguments but reserve the judgment in\nthat case. The same learned Judge must thereafter\ndispose of the matters by two separate judgments. In\ndeciding each of the cases, he can rely only on the\nevidence recorded in that particular case. The\nevidence recorded in the cross cannot be looked into.\nNor can the judge be influenced by whatever is argued\nin the cross case. Each case must be decided on the\nbasis of the evidence which has been placed on record\nin that particular case without being influenced in\nany manner by the evidence or arguments urged in the\ncross case. But both the judgments must be pronounced\nby the same learned Judge one after the other.\"\n13. How to implement the said scheme in a situation\nwhere one of the two cases (relating to the same\nincident) is charge-sheeted or complained of,\ninvolves offences or offence exclusively triable by a\nCourt of Sessions, but none of the offences involved\nin the other case is exclusively triable by the\nSessions Court. The magistrate before whom the former\ncase reaches has no escape from committing the case\nto the Sessions Court as provided in Section 209 of\nthe Code. Once the said case is committed to the\nSessions Court, thereafter it is governed by the\nprovisions submitted in Chapter XVIII of the Code.\nThough, the next case cannot be committed in\naccordance with Section 209 of the Code, the\nmagistrate has, nevertheless, power to commit the\ncase to the court of Sessions, albeit none of the\noffences involved therein is exclusively triable by\nthe Sessions Court. Section 323 is incorporated in\nthe Code to meet similar cases also. That section\nreads thus:\n\"Tf, in any inguiry into an offence or a trial\nbefore a Magistrate, it appears to him at any stage\nof the proceedings before signing judgment that the\ncase is one which ought to be tried by the Court of\nSession, he shall commit it to that Court under the\nprovisions hereinbefore contained and thereupon the\nprovisions of chapter XVIII shail apply to the\ncommitment so made.\"\n14. The above section does not make an inroad into\nSection 209 because the former is intended to cover\ncases to which Section 209 does not apply. When a\nmagistrate has committed a case on account of his\nlegislative compulsion by Section 209, its cross\ncase, having no offence exclusively triable by the\nSessions Court, must appear to the magistrate as one\n\nPeel\n\nUe\n\naoe H\n\nCr1.MC.No.5259 OF 2015 2021/KER/1231\n10\n\nwhich ought to be tried by the same Court of\n\nSessions. We have already adverted to the sturdy\n\nreasons as to why it should be so. Hence, the\n\nmagistrate can exercise the special power conferred\n\non him by virtue of Section 323 of the Code when he\n\ncommits the cross case aliso to the Court of\n\nSessions. Commitment under Section 209 and 323 might\n\nbe through two different channels, but once they are\n\ncommitted their subsequent flow could only be\n\nthrough the stream channelised by the provisions\n\ncontained in Chapter XVIII.”\n\n9. Admittedly, the main case which is Crime\nNo.95/2013 concluded as per Annexure II judgment\nin which the husband of the 2nd respondent is\nalready convicted and sentenced. Therefore, there\nis no chance for a simulteneous trial of Annexure\nIII complaint and Crime No.95/2013. Hence the\ncontinuation of Annexure III will definitely\nprejudice the interest of the petitioners/accused.\n\n10. Annexure IV is the order by which learned\nMagistrate taken oon file as C.P.No.12/2015.\nAnnexure IV order is extracted hereunder:\n\n“Heard. Perused the records and statement of\n\nwitness u/s 202, I am of the opinion that this is\n\nsufficient to proceed against the accused. Hence\n\nthe complaint is taken on file as C.P.No.12/15 for\n\nthe offence punishable u/s 323, 324, 308, 506(i)\n\nr/w 34 IPC 3(1) (xX) of SC/ST (Prevention of\n\nAtrocities)Act 1989. Take steps to issue summons.\n\nReturn of summons — 30.6.15.%\n\neae\nCr1.MC.No.5259 OF 2015 2021/KER/1231\n11\n\n11. A perusal of the above order will show\nthat there is nothing to show that the learned\nMagistrate considered Annexure I refer report\nwhile taking cognizance of the above offences.\nThis Court in Kader v. State of Kerala 1999(3)KLT\n55 observed like this:\n\n“7. The Court noted that the scope of enquiry\n\nunder §.202 is the ascertainment of the truth or\n\nfalsity of the allegations made in the complaint on\n\nthe materials placed by the complainant before the\n\nCourt for the limited purpose of finding out\n\nwhether the prima facie case for issue of process\n\nhas been made out and for deciding the question\n\npurely from the point of view of the complainant\n\nwithout at ali adverting to any defence that the\n\naccused may have. Nevertheless, the Court has a\n\nduty to protect the interest of the absent accused\n\nalso because at the particular stage, the accused\n\nhas no say in the matter and the matter is decided\n\nwithout notice to him. Tt is, therefore, open to\n\nthe Magistrate to scrutinise carefully the\n\nallegations made in the complaint with a view to\n\nprevent the accused therein from being called upon\n\nto face obviously frivolous complaint and to find\n\nwhat material there is to support the allegations\n\nmade in the complaint. The Magistrate has a duty\n\nnot only to bring to book a person or persons\n\nagainst whom grave allegations are made in the\n\ncomplaint but also to protect the interest of the\n\nabsent accused in such matters. What all should\n\ntake cognizance of the offence, will depend upon\n\nthe facts and circumstances of each case. He has\n\nnecessarily to consider the allegations made in the\n\ncomplaint and the statement of the complainant\n\nrecorded under S$.200 Cr.P.C as aiso of the\n\nwitnesses examined under S§.202 of the Cr.P.C.\n\nAlong with that, he has also to consider the result\n\nof enguiry or investigation, if any, held by the\n\npolice. It cannot be said that the said data is\n\nnot an essential factor. The consideration of the\n\nmaterials under §.202 of the Cr.P.C. is not an\n\nempty formality and cannot be done in a perfunctory\n\nor mechanical manner or by adopting a superficial\n\napproach.”\n\nfoe\nBint: 42\n2021/KER/1231\nCr1.MC.No.5259 OF 2015 /\n12\n\n12. Similarly in Parameswaran Nair Vv.\nSurendran 2009 (1) KLT 794, this Court observed\nlike this:\n\n“12. If the original complaint stood dismissed by\nthe acceptance of the refer report submitted after\ninvestigation the protest complaint if any filed\ncan only be treated as a second complaint. If so,\nthe protest complaint will lie only if there was a\nmanifest error or manifest miscarriage of justice\nin the earlier order or new facts which the\ncomplainant had no knowledge of or with reasonable\ndiligence could not have brought forward in the\nprevious proceedings is adduced. When this is the\nlegal position, it is not lawful to the Magistrate\nto ignore the final report submitted by the Police\nunder Section 173(2) of the Code. Magistrate is\nbound to consider the final report and decide\nwhich of the options available to him is to be\nexercised.”\n\n13. In the light of the above decisions,\naccording to me Annexure IV order is\nunsustainable. As I said earlier there is nothing\nto show in Annexure IV order to the effect that\nthe learned Magistrate considered Annexure I refer\nreport while passing that order. Therefore,\nAnnexure IV order is unsustainable.\n\n14. Then the next question is what is the\npurpose in remanding this matter to the lower\ncourt. Admittely, the main case is already\ndisposed by the learned Sessions Judge as per\n\nce\nCr1.MC.No.5259 OF 2015 2021U/KER/231\n13\n\nAnnexure II judgment. Therefore, there cannot be\na simultaneous trial as held by the Apex Court in\nSudir's case (Supra). Hence, there is no purpose\nin remanding this matter to the learned\nMagistrate. Moreover, the petitioners will be\nprejudiced if Annexure III is proceeded because\nthe main case is already disposed as evident by\nAnnexure II Judgment. Moreover, proviso to\nSection 202 Cr.P.C. says that if it appears to the\nMagistrate that the offence committed is triable\nexclusively by the court of Sessions, he shall\ncall up on the complainant to produce all his\nwitnesses and examine them. Admittedly, there are\nfive witnesses mentioned in Annexure III\ncomplaint. It is an admitted fact that only four\nwitnesses were examined before the learned\nMagistrate in Section 202 Cr.P.C. enquiry. On\nthat ground also the order is unsustainable.\n\n15. The alleged incident in this case happened\non 14.02.2013. The Police after investigation\nsubmitted Annexure I refer report on 14.05.2015.\n\nfone\neae\nCr1.MC.No.5259 OF 2015 2021U/KER/231\n14\n\nThereafter, the main case was disposed by the\nlearned Sessions Judge on 29.10.2014. Thereafter\nAnnexure III complaint was filed on 12.05.2015.\nAccording to me the continuation of Annexures III\nand IV proceedings is an abuse of process of court\nin the light of the facts and circumstances of\nthis case and also for the reasons mentioned\nabove.\n\nTherefore, this Cr1l.M.C. is allowed and all\nfurther proceedings in C.P.No.12/2015 on the file\nof the Judicial First Class Magistrate court,\nIdukki are quashed.\n\nSd/-\nP.V.KUNHIKRISHNAN\nJUDGE\nDM\n\nFaas seta]\nce\nCr1.MC.No.5259 OF 2015 202UKER/1231\n15\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONERS' EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE -I TRUE COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT IN CRIME\nNO. 115/2013 OF IDUKKI POLICE STATION\nANNEXURE -II TRUE COPY OF THE JUDGMENT DTD\n29/10/2014 IN SC NO 322/2013 DISPOSED\nBY THE II ADDL.SESSIONS\nJUDGE , THODUPUZHA\nANNEXURE -III CERTIFIED COPY OF THE PRIVATE COMPLAINT\nFILED BY THE 2ND RESPONDENT ON\n12/5/2015 BEFORE THE JFCM, IDUKKI\nANNEXURE -IV CERTIFIED COPY OF THE ORDER TAKING\nCOGNIZANCE DATED 20.05.2015 AS\nC.P.NO.12/2015 BY JFCM, IDUKKI\nRESPONDENTS' EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE R2 (A) : TRUE COPY OF THE DISCHARGE CARD DATED\n18/02/2013 ISSUED FROM THE MEDICAL\nCOLLEGE HOSPITAL, KOTTAYAM.\nANNEXURE R2 (B) : TRUE COPY OF THE REPLY DATED 19/09/2014\nISSUED BY THE PUBLIC INFORMATION\nOFFICER, JUDICIAL FIRST CLASS\nMAGISTRATE COURT, IDUKKI.\n//TRUE COPY//\nPA TO JUDGE\n\n"
