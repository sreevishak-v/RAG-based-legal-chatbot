PUBLIC PROSECUTOR SRI.AMJAD ALI\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION\nON 10.01.2020, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE\nFOLLOWING:\n\nape\n2020/KER/1238\nCri.M.C.No.189 of 2020\n-2-\nCrl.M.C.No.189 of 2020\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner is the sole accused in S.C.No.910 of\n2018 on the files of the Additional District and Sessions Court\n(POCSO), Kozhikode. The petitioner was arrested during the\ninvestigation of the case and he was released on bail on\n27.05.2018. It is stated that he did not receive the summons\nissued by the trial court thereafter as he was abroad on\nemployment and consequently, he could not appear before the\ntrial court. It is also stated that in the circumstances, the court\nhas issued warrant of arrest against the petitioner. The petitioner\nis prepared to surrender before the court below for facing the\ntrial, but he apprehends that if he surrenders, he will be\nremanded to custody on the premise that he is a person who has\nevaded the summons. The petitioner, therefore, seeks\nappropriate directions to the court below to recall the warrant of\narrest issued against him and enlarge him on bail on his\nappearance.\n\nClearer\nE on\nrene\nape\n2020/KER/1238\nCr1.M.C.No.189 of 2020\n-3-\n\n2. Should the warrant of arrest issued against the\npetitioner be recalled and should he be released on bail are\nmatters for the trial court to consider. There is absolutely no\nreason for me to think that if the petitioner surrenders before the\ncourt below and offers satisfactory explanation for the non-\nappearance, the learned trial judge would mechanically remand\nhim to custody, without considering his application for bail.\nNevertheless, having regard to the submissions made by the\nlearned counsel for the petitioner and having regard to the orders\npassed by this court in similar and identical matters, | am of the\nview that the Crl.M.C. can be disposed of with a direction to the\ncourt below that if the petitioner surrenders before the court and\napplies for recalling the warrant and for bail, the same shall be\nconsidered and disposed of by the court below on the same day\nitself, with notice to the Public Prosecutor. Ordered accordingly.\n\nSd/-\nP.B.SURESH KUMAR, JUDGE.\nds\n\nnoes\ncop ‘ be\n2020/KER/1238\nCr1.M.C.No.189 of 2020\n-A-\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE TRUE COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT IN CRIME\nNO. 212 OF 2018 OF THE PERAMBRA POLICE\nSTATION, KOZHIKODE RURAL.\n\n"
