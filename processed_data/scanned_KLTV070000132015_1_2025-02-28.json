The prosecution’s case in brief is as follows:- That at around\n5.45 p.m., on 22.12.2012, the informant - Shameer by driving the\ngovernment motor car bearing registration No.KL-01-BD-9622 reached\nnear the Cotton Hill School, Vazhuthacaudu, and then the motor cycle\nbearing No. KL-01-BF-4029 somehow fell down touching the motor car\ndriven by the informant. He enquired about this matter and out of this\n\n3\n\nanimosity, the accused wrongfully restrained the informant and the\naccused Nos.1 and 2 voluntarily caused hurt to the informant by hitting\nhim with hand and abused him uttering obscene words to his annoyance\nand the accused Nos. 3 and 4 voluntarily caused hurt to the informant and\ntorn off the shirt that worn by the informant and thereby the accused\nobstructed the informant from discharging his official duty as such public\nservant. The accused, thereby committed the offences punishable under\nsection 294(b), 341, 323 and 332 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code.\n\n3. The Sub Inspector of Police, Museum Police Station,\nregistered the case as Crime No.1291/2012 on the basis of the First\nInformation Statement given by the informant and conducted the\ninvestigation and submitted the charge sheet before this court. On the\nbasis of the charge sheet, cognizance was taken for the offences punishable\nunder section 341, 294(b), 323 and 332 r/w sec.34 of the Indian Penal Code\nand the charge sheet was taken on file as Calendar Case No.1618/2015.\n\n4. Summons was issued to the accused. The accused Nos. 2 to\n4 appeared before the court. The 1st accused absconded. So the case\nagainst him was split up. The accused Nos.2 to 4 were enlarged on bail.\nMy predecessor-in-office framed the charges for the offences punishable\nunder section 341, 323 and 332 r/w sec.34 of the Indian Penal Code and read\nand explained to the accused in Malayalam to which they pleaded not guilty.\n\n5. The prosecution’s evidence consists of the oral evidence of PW1\nto PW5 and the documentary evidence of Ext.P1 to P14. After closing the\nevidence of the prosecution, the accused Nos. 2 to 4 were questioned under\nsection 313 of the CrP.C. They denied all incriminating circumstances\nbrought out in evidence against them. Though they were called upon to enter\ndefence and adduce evidence, they did not adduce any evidence.\n\n4\n\n6. | Heard both parties. Perused the records.\n\n7. The points that arise for consideration are as follows:-\n\n1. Whether the accused in furtherance of their common\nintention, wrongfully restrained PW1 and thereby\ncommitted the offence punishable under section 341 r/w\nsec.34 of the Indian Penal Code?\n\n2. Whether the accused in furtherance of their common\nintention, voluntarily caused hurt to PW1 and thereby\ncommitted the offence punishable under section 323 1/w\nsec.34 of the Indian Penal Code?\n\n3. Whether the accused in furtherance of their common\nintention, voluntarily caused hurt to PW1 with intent to\nprevent PW1 from discharging his official duty and\nthereby committed the offence punishable under section\n332 r/w sec.34 of the Indian Penal Code?\n\n4, What should be the proper punishment to be awarded\nto the accused Nos.2 to 4 if they are found guilty of any\noffence?\n\n8. Point Nos.1 to 3:- For convenience of discussion of evidence,\nthese three points are considered together. Though coercive steps were\nrepeatedly issued and many opportunities were given, the prosecution could\nnot either bring PW1 to the court or get him examined through audio vedio\nelectronic linkage. The prosecution examined PW1 and PW2 stating that\nthey are the eye witnesses. They did not support the prosecution’s case\nstating that they had not seen the transaction resulting injury to the informant.\nThough the prosecution examined the investigating officer, there is nothing\non record to prove the charges as there is no substantive evidence. There is\n\n5\nno evidence to show that the accused Nos.2 to 4 in furtherance of their\ncommon intention, wrongfully restrained the informant or voluntarily caused\nhurt to him. Hence these points are found against the prosecution.\n\n9. Point No.4:- Since the prosecution failed to prove that the\naccused had committed any offence, there does not arise any question of\nimposing punishment on them. Hence this point is also found against the\nprosecution.\n\nIn the result, the accused Nos. 2 to 4 are found not guilty of the\noffences punishable under section 341, 323 and 332 r/w sec.34 of the Indian\nPenal Code. Hence they are acquitted under section 248(1) of the Cr.P.C.\nTheir bail bonds stand cancelled. They are set at liberty. The case against the\n1st accused is re-filed as Calendar Case No.2310/2015.\n\n(Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected and\npronounced by me in open court on 28th day of February, 2025)\nSd/-\nChief Judicial Magistrate\nThiruvananthapuram\nAppendix\nWitnesses for prosecution:-\nPW1  : Udayakumar : Eye witness\nPW2  :  Vijesh : Eye witness\nPW3  :~ Edwin : Mahazar witness\nPW4 :  G.Premakumar : Police witness\nPW5  : Jagadeesh Mahazar witness\nExhibits for prosecution:-\nP1 : First information statement dated 22/12/12 marked\nthrough PW4 on 11/05/23\n\n6\n\nPi(a) :  Bodynote marked through PW4 on 11/05/23\n\nP2 :  ELR dated 22/12/12 marked through PW4 on 11/05/23\n\nP3 : Scene mahazar dated 23/12/12 marked through PW4 on\n11/05/23\n\nP4 : Vehicle mahazar dated 23/12/12 marked through PW4\non 11/05/23\n\nP5 : Vehicle mahazar dated 23/12/12 marked through PW4\non 11/05/23\n\nP6 : Vehicle mahazar dated 23/12/12 marked through PW4 on\n11/05/23\n\nP7 : Report identifying accused dated 11/2/13 marked\nthrough PW4 on 11/05/23\n\nP8 : OP ticket (Rakesh) dated 23/12/12 marked through PW4\non 11/05/23\n\nP9 : OP ticket (Riju) dated 23/12/12 marked through PW4 on\n11/05/23\n\nP10 :  OPticket (Ashim) dated 23/12/12 marked through PW4\non 11/05/23\n\nPil : OP ticket (Arun Kumar) dated 23/12/12 marked through\nPW4 on 11/05/23\n\nP12 : Property list (mobile phones) dated 22/12/12 dated\n23/12/12 marked through PW4 on 11/05/23\n\nP13 : Property list (motor cycles) dated 22/12/12 marked\nthrough PW4 on 11/05/23\n\nP14 : Form 15 dated 21/10/13 dated 23/12/12 marked through\nPW4 on 11/05/23\n\nSd/-\nChief Judicial Magistrate\nThiruvananthapuram\n(True copy)\n\n"
