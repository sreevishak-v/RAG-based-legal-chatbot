The crux of the prosecution\nallegation is that petitioner while working as manager of Vyaya Bank\ncommitted misappropriation of money.\n\n2. In this petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure, petitioner seeks to quash Annexure-4 application filed by\nAssistant Public Prosecutor under Section 173 (8) of the Cr.P.C for\nordering further investigation in the above case.\n\n3. I have heard learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the\nlearned Public Prosecutor.\n\nan\n2016/KER/23873\nCrl.MC.7213/15 â€œ123+\n4. Referring to Annexure-1 order of this Court in Crl.R.P No.\n629 of 2014, it is submitted by learned counsel for the petitioner that\non an earlier occasion, the de facto complainant had approached this\nCourt when the application submitted for further investigation was\nrejected by the learned Magistrate. This Court had passed certain\ndirections, but did not interfere with the findings. It is submitted that\nlater the petitioner submitted an application for expeditious trial of\nthe proceedings and as per Annexure-2 order dated 15.01.2015 this\nCourt had issued directions to the learned Magistrate to try and\ndispose off the case as expeditiously as possible. The learned\ncounsel also submitted that several applications are being filed before\nthe learned Magistrate in order to protract the trial which would\ncause irreparable hardship. It is pointed out that the criminal\nproceedings are pending since 2008 and the intention of the de facto\ncomplainant is to protract the matter on one reason or the other. It is\nfurther submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that Hard\n\nBeier\n2016/KER/23873\nCrl.MC.7213/15 ~:3:-\nDisk of the server of the Vijaya Bank, Cherthala was forwarded to\nthe 2\" respondent , for obtaining expert report in the year 2015 and\nthe same was received by the lab authorities on 18.6.2015. However,\ntill date the report has not been submitted before Court.\n\n5. Learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submits that trial\nwas being proceeded in an expeditious manner pursuant to Annexure-\n2 order of this Court. However, it is submitted that the report from\nthe Forensic Science Laboratory 1s awaited.\n\n6. After having heard the rival submissions, I am of the view\nthat this Court will not be justified in quashing an application filed\nunder Section 173(8) of the CrP.C by the Assistant Public\nProsecutor. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner prays that a\ndirection be issued to the learned Magistrate to consider the\nmaintainability of the application as well , in view of Annexure-1\norder of this Court . I take note of the fact that the learned Magistrate\nhas not even passed an order in the said application . It is for the\n\nBeier\n2016/KER/23873\nCrl.MC.7213/15 -~24:-\nlearned Magistrate to consider the application on its merit and to pass\nappropriate orders. Needless to mention, the contention of the\npetitioner, that no such application is maintainable shall also be\nconsidered.\n\n8. Insofar as the prayer for expeditious trial is concerned, this\nCourt as per Annexure-2 order in Crl.M.C No.269 of 2015 have\nalready issued direction to the learned Magistrate to take earnest\nefforts to try and dispose of the case expeditiously. No further\ndirections are required in view of the above order.\n\n9. The Director of Regional Forensic Laboratory,\nThiruvananthapuram is arrayed as the second respondent herein and\nit is borne out from records that Hard Disk of the Vijaya Bank was\nforwarded for the purpose of obtaining expert report. It is submitted\nby the learned Public Prosecutor that the Hard Disk was received by\nthe Forensic Laboratory on 18.06.2015. More than a year has\nelapsed and as the offence involved is fabrication and manipulation\n\nel\n\npatel\n\napes\n\n2016/KER/23873\nCrl.MC.7213/15 ~5:-\nof electronic records concerning a bank. I am of the view that\nnecessary direction are to be issued to the second respondent to\nexpedite the analysis of the Hard Disk and to submit a report before\nthe jurisdictional Magistrate. Efforts shall be taken to submit the\nreport within a period of two months from the date of receipt of a\ncopy of this order.\nCrl.M.C is disposed off accordingly.\nSd/-\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.V\nJUDGE\n\nkrj.\n\n"
