According to the prosecution, on 01.07.2020 the first petitioner\nthrew a cement block on the leg of the son of the de facto\ncomplainant, while the 2™ petitioner kicked him and thereby\ncommitted the offences alleged.\n\n3. Sri.D.G.Vipin, the learned counsel for the petitioners, submitted\nthat the complaint has been filed with ma/a fides and solely to\nwreak vengeance due to a civil dispute pending between the\nparties. It was further submitted that O.S.No.206/2018 filed by\nthe the 2™ petitioner against the de facto complainant is\n\nch\nSaat\n2024/KER/630\nCRL.MC 70/2024\n3\npending and that the present complaint has been initiated only\nto compel the petitioners to settle the said civil dispute. It was\nfurther submitted that the entire prosecution allegations are\nfalse and that, none of the offences are even made out.\n\n4. Sri.M.C.Ashi, the learned Public Prosecutor, submitted that the\nnature of the allegations in the final report reveals that the\nsame is a matter for trial.\n\n5. On a perusal of the final report as well as the statement\nproduced along with it, this Court notices that there are factual\nallegations, which require appreciation of facts. The remedy\nunder Section 482 of Cr.P.C. cannot be involved in such an\ninstance.\n\n6. Apart from the above, the petitioner has remedies available\nunder the Cr.P.C., to seek discharge from the offences alleged.\nRecourse to the remedy under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. ought to\nbe availed of only in exceptional circumstances where the\nmaterials collected by the investigating officer, even if admitted,\nwould not make out an offence as alleged or when there are\nproved mala fides.\n\naol\nile sans 4\n2024/KER/630\nCRL.MC 70/2024\n4\n\n7. As observed above, a perusal of the allegations in the final\nreport and the records will reveal that such a remedy under\nSection 482 of Cr.P.C. is not available to the petitioners.\nTherefore, I find no merit in the Crl.M.C. and the same is\ndismissed.\n\n8. However, the dismissal of this Crl.M.C. shall not stand in the\nway of the petitioners taking recourse to other remedies\navailable under law.\n\nsd/-\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\nAMV/06/01/2024\n\nPie eral\npierre\nieee\n2024/KER/630\nCRL.MC 70/2024\n5\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 70/2024\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES\nANNEXURE 1 TRUE COPY OF THE FIR IN CRIME NO. 1044\nOF 2020\nANNEXURE A-2 TRUE COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT IN CRIME\nNO. 1044 OF 2020\nTRUE COPY\n\n"
