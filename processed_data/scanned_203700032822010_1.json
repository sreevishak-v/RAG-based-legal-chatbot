Petitioner is\nthe sole accused in a complaint case filed before the Judicial\nFirst Class Magistrate Court-I, Attingal, numbered as\nC.C.No.1092 of 2008. The offence alleged against the\npetitioner herein is one punishable under Section 500 of the\nIndian Penal Code (in short, “IPC’). Annexure A is the\ncomplaint.\n\n2. Allegation is that the Malayalam Daily by name\n‘Malayala Manorama’' published a news item on 12.04.2006 with\na caption “ni1g]aog91@ asim mM wilew eadoMnfl23”. Admittedly, the\npetitioner is the editor of the news paper. The complainant/1*\nrespondent submitted that the statements in the news item are\nfalse and, per se, defamatory to him. Gist of the news item is\nthat the complainant’s mother was locked up in a kennel and she\nwas in an abandoned state. Local people intervened and rescued\n\nPletal\n2014/KER/55\nCr1.M.C.No.3282 of 2010 2\nher. It is also mentioned in the news item that the complainant’s\nmother was labeled as an insane person and illegally confined in\nthe kennel. Complainant would contend that all those\nallegations are false and amounted to defamatory statements.\n\n3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, the\nlearned counsel for the first respondent and the learned Public\nProsecutor.\n\n4. Learned counsel for the first respondent submitted\nthat Annexure A complaint revealed an offence of defamation\ndefined under Section 499 I.PC. It is also submitted by the\nlearned counsel that the fact that his mother was locked up in a\nkennel itself is a disputed fact. It cannot be resolved in a\nproceeding under Section 482 Cr.P.C, he contended.\n\n5. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the\ncontents in the news item squarely fall within the first exception\nto Section 499 LP.C. Not only the petitioner's news paper, but\nalso other leading news papers had published this news item.\n\nPletal\n2014/KER/55\n\nCrl.M.C.No.3282 of 2010 3\nGoing by the first exception to Section 499 IPC, it is clear that if\nanything is imputed which is true concerning any person, if it be\nfor the public good that the imputation should be made or\npublished, then, it is not a defamation. Annexures C and D\nwould show that other leading Malayalam dailies have also\npublished the news. Further, in Annexure F reply notice send to\nAnnexure E lawyer notice, it had been clearly stated that local\ntelevision channels have telecasted the wrongful confinement of\nthe complainant’s mother in a kennel.\n\n6. It is also contended by the learned counsel for the\npetitioner that the petitioner has no role in choosing the local news\nitem. He is the editor of the daily. Since the editor is not involved in\nselecting the news items, he cannot be prosecuted for an offence\nunder Section 500 IPC. To buttress this contention, the decision in\nMammen Mathew v. Radhakrishnan (2007 (4) KLT 833) is\npressed into service. Considering the averments in the petition\nand on perusing the relevant legal provision, I am of the view\n\nBeat\n\n2014/KER/55\nCr1.M.C.No.3282 of 2010 4\nthat the publication herein will squarely fall within the first\nexception to Section 499 I.P.C. Consequently, I find that there is\nno legal basis for prosecuting the petitioner for the alleged\noffence. The prosecution is nothing, but an abuse of the process\nof the court.\n\nIn the result, the Crl.M.C is allowed. Annexure A\ncomplaint pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate\nCourt — I, Attingal is hereby quashed",
