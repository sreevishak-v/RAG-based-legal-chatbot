No.2880 of 2015\nDated this the 5\" day of January, 2018\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner is the accused in C.C.No.18/2014 on\nthe files of the court below. The above case arose out of a\nprivate complaint filed by the first respondent herein\nbefore the court below against the petitioner alleging\noffence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments\nAct.\n\n2. The case was. originally pending = as\nS.T.No.21/2010 before the court below. However,\nthereafter, the case was converted as C.C.No.18/2014 by\nthe court below. The court below also ordered denova\ntrial on the ground that a part of the evidence was\nrecorded by the predecessor of the presiding officer of the\ncourt below.\n\n3. The petitioner filed C.M.P.No.62/2014 before the\ncourt below praying for sending Ext.P1 cheque for expert\nopinion for ascertaining as to whether the signature, date,\n\neo\na\n2018/KER/479\nCri. M.C. No.2880 of 2015\n“i 2t-\nname and amount in Ext.P1 were authorised by a single\nperson or not. The court below as per Annexure-G order\ndated 4.2.2015 dismissed the said C.M.P., against which\nthis Crl.M.C. has been filed.\n\n4. Heard both sides.\n\n5. The petitioner earlier filed C.M.P.No.8/2011,\npraying for sending Ext.Pl cheque’ for _ forensic\nexamination of the handing. Even though the said\napplication was allowed initially, the same was\nsubsequently dismissed on the reason that the petitioner\ndid not produce specimen signature. Thereafter, the\npetitioner filed C.M.P.No.60/2011 for sending Ext.P1\ncheque and Ext.P8 letter for expert opinion. The court\nbelow allowed the’ prayer in respect of Ext.P8 letter.\nHowever, the court below turned down the prayer with\nregard to Ext.P1 cheque. Thereafter, the petitioner filed\nthe present petition.\n\neo\na\n2018/KER/479\nCri. M.C. No.2880 of 2015\n“i 3ue\n6. | have gone through the evidence of PW1. PW1\nstated that Ext.P1 was filled up before bringing the same\nto the complainant and thereafter, the accused put the\nsignature in Ext.P1 cheque in the presence of PW1. The\nevidence of PW1 is clear that PW1 did not see the accused\nor any other person filling up the cheque. What PW1 had\nseen was only affixing the signature in the cheque by the\naccused. In view of the above evidence of PW1, no\npurpose will be served even if the present petition is\nallowed. In the said circumstances, there is no meaning in\nascertaining as to whether the signature, date, name and\namount in Ext.P1 were written by the same person or not.\nFor the said reason, | am not inclined to set aside the\norder impugned. Accordingly, this Crl.M.C. stands\ndismissed.\nHowever, | make it clear that if Ext.P8 is not yet sent\nfor expert opinion as per the order of the court below in\nC.M.P.No.60/2011 in S.T.No.21/2010, the petitioner shall\n\nBare\net :\nBRE;\n2018/KER/479\nCri. M.C. No.2880 of 2015\n-: 435-\nbe at liberty to file fresh application before the court\nbelow for the same.\nSd/-\nB. SUDHEENDRA KUMAR,\nJUDGE\nSTK\n/[TRUE COPY//\n/IP.A. TO JUDGE//\n\n"
