CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON\n06.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nCr. MC.5029/2020 2 202 URERITIB\nV.G.ARUN, J.\nDated this the 6\" day of January, 2020\nORDER\n\nPetitioner is the 2\" accused in Crime No.217 of 2018 of Thrissur\nWest Police Station, registered for the offence punishable under\nSection 22(b)(ii)B of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substance\nAct. The crime was registered pursuant to the seizure of 2.60\nKilograms of dried ganja from the 1* accused. On questioning, the first\naccused stated that the petitioner was his accomplice and had\nescaped on seeing the Police. The petitioner was arrested on\n12.11.2018 and granted bail subject to certain conditions, including\nthe condition that the petitioner should not indulge in any other\noffence while on bail. Later, the prosecution sought cancellation of the\nbail alleging that the petitioner had violated the bail condition by\ngetting involved in three crimes. According to the prosecution, Crime\nNo.1122 of 2018 was registered against the petitioner and four others\nat the Kunnamkulam Police Station on 3.12.2018 for offences\npunishable under Section 143, 147, 148, 341, 308, 506 read with 149\nIPC. Thereafter, Crime No.954 of 2019 was registered on 27.9.2019 for\noffences under Sections 447, 294B, 506 and 427 of IPC. Again, Crime\nNo.997 of 2019 was registered on 12.12.2019 for the offences\n\nCr. MC.5029/2020 3 202 URERITIB\npunishable under Sections 341, 323, 324, 294B and 506 of IPC. The\npetitioner opposed the application and produced some medical records\nto prove that, on all three occasions, he was admitted in hospitals,\neither on the date of occurrence of the alleged crime or on the\nsubsequent days. It was contended that the petitioner was actually the\nvictim and not the aggressor. The learned Sessions Judge repelled the\nobjection and held that, irrespective of whether the petitioner suffered\ninjuries in the incidents or not, the fact of the matter is that he had\nviolated the bail condition by getting involved in the crimes. Based on\nthe said finding, bail granted to the petitioner was cancelled as per\nAnnexure-Al order dated 7.3.2020.\n\n2. The learned counsel for the petitioner reiterated the\ncontentions urged before the Sessions Court, of the petitioner being\nthe victim in the three crimes and having been deliberately made an\naccused in order to make it appear that he had violated the bail\ncondition. Relying on certain medical records, attempt was made to\ncontend that, petitioner was not the aggressor and had been falsely\nimplicated in the crimes.\n\n3. As rightly held by the learned Sessions Judge, the Court need\nbe concerned only about the petitioner's involvement in offences while\nhe was on bail. This fact is amply established by registration of the\ncrimes against him and it is impossible to believe that three different\ncrimes were registered against the petitioner to make it appear that he\n\nCr. MC.5029/2020 4 202 URERITIB\nhad violated the bail condition. Hence, | find no reason to interfere with\nAnnexure A1 order.\n\nIn the result, the Crl.M.C is dismissed.\nSd/-\nV.G.ARUN, JUDGE\nvgs\n\npr eeeeac\nFr Sd\nâ€œ\nPier\n2021/KER/774\nCrl.
