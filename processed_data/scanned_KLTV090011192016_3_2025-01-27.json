This is a case instituted upon the final report filed by Sub Inspector of\nPolice, Karamana Police Station in Crime No. 578/2010 for the offence under\nSection 498A r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred to\nas the ‘IPC’).\n2. The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: The marriage of the\nInformant and the 1* Accused was solemnized on 18.08.2000. Ever since her\nresidence at the matrimonial home, she has been physically and mentally\nharassed in the name of dowry by the Accused persons herein, in\nfurtherance of their common intention. She was coerced to get from her\nmother an amount of Rs. 1,50,000/- (Rupees One Lakhs Fifty Thousand Only)\nand handover the same to the Accused persons. When she refused the\ndemand for more money, allegations were made against her and pursuant to\nhaving taken possession of her gold ornaments, the Accused persons\ndeserted her. Under the instigation of the 2™ and 3% Accused, the 1*\nAccused approached the Court for obtaining divorce and the Informant in\n\n3\nturn, for return of gold and ornaments from them as well as proceeded\nagainst them for having committed domestic violence against her. Through\nintervention of relatives, the issues were sorted out and they started residing\ntogether separately in a rented premise. However, the physical, mental and\nverbal abuse continued. The 1* Accused got her gold ornaments under the\nguise of keeping the same in locker and misapporopriated the same by\nselling it off and deposited the same in financial institution, but withdrew the\nsame. She was coerced to give them an amount of Rupees Four Lakhs only\nfrom her Federal Bank account, which was never returned to her. She was\nmentally, verbally and physically abused by the Accused persons for demand\nof dowry and the same subsequently led to the death of her parents due to\nmental agony. The car gifted by her parents was sold off by the Accused\npersons and they even attempted to forcefully take away their child. Thus,\nthe Accused persons are thereby alleged to have committed the offence\npunishable under Section 498A r/w 34 of the IPC.\n3. On issuance of process, the Accused persons entered appearance.\nThey were enlarged on bail. They were represented by a Counsel of their\nown choice. Copies of all relevant Prosecution records were furnished to\nthem. After hearing both parties and on perusing relevant records, charge\nwas framed for offence u/S. 498A r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. It\nwas read over and explained to them, to which they pleaded not guilty and\nclaimed to be tried.\n4. From the side of Prosecution CWs 9, 10, 5 and 2 were examined as\nPW1 to PW4 respectively and Exhibit P1 to P6 were marked. The Learned\nAPP gave up the remaining witnesses as the Informant never turned up\nbefore this Court and the material witnesses turned hostile to the\nProsecution and the Prosecution evidence was closed. The Accused persons\nwere examined under Section 313(1)(b) of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973\n(hereinafter referred to as the CrPC). They denied all the incriminating\nevidence against them and submitted that they were absolutely innocent of\nall the allegations levelled against them.\n\n4\n\n5. Heard both sides and perused relevant documents. The following\n\npoints arise for consideration.\n\na. Have the Accused persons in furtherance of their common intention\nsubjected the Informant to cruelty and thereby committed offence\npunishable under Section 498A r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged?\n\nb. If so, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded?\n\n6. Point (a): PW1, is the Investigating Officer in the above case. He\n\ndeposed that he had registered Exhibit P1 FIR in this case on the basis of\n\nExhibit P2 Complaint forwarded from this Court. He had recorded the\n\nstatements of the witnesses, visited the place of occurrence and prepared\n\nExhibit P3 Scene Mahazar. He prepared Exhibit P4 Mahazar pertaining to\n\nthe marriage of the Informant and 1* Accused from the marriage register.\n\nHe deposed that the alleged commission of the offences took place during\n\nthe period between 18.08.2000 and 19.08.2010.\n\nPW2, deposed that he took over the investigation from PW1, verified\nthe records, prepared Exhibit P5 Address Report pertaining to the details of\nthe Accused persons, completed the investigation and filed Charge Sheet\nagainst them.\n\nPW3, the occurrence witness, deposed that she knew the Informant\nsince her mother was alive and that the Informant and the 1* Accused were\nnot in terms and had disagreements between them, on account of which the\npresent case was filed. She deposed that she gave statement to the police\nofficials about the incident and further that the statement she gave to the\nPolice that the Informant was harassed on account of demand for dowry is\ncorrect, however the same is only hearsay.\n\nThe Learned Counsel for the Accused would argue that the\ningredients of Section 498A of the IPC has not been established by the\nProsecution. The Informant herself has not turned up before this Court. The\nonly occurrence witness who has been examined herein is not a credible\nwitness. She has no consistent case. Her testimony cannot be believed.\n\n5\nThere is nothing on record so as to implicate the Accused persons in the\nabove case.\n\nIt is settled that in order to constitute cruelty, the willful conduct of\nthe husband should be of such a nature that it is likely to drive the woman to\nCommit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to her life. There is no\ncase that the complainant attempted to commit suicide or that there was any\ngrave injury caused posing danger to her life. Under explanation (b)\nharassment, so as to amount to cruelty, has to be with a view to coerce the\nwife or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for any\nproperty or valuable security or on account of failure to meet such demands.\nAppreciating the evidence of PWs 1 to 3 together what is evident is that the\nallegation that there was demand for more dowry is not supported by any\nreliable evidence. As regards the version of assault is concerned, the same is\nunsupported by oral and medical evidence.\n\nAs rightly pointed out by the Learned Counsel for the Accused, the\nInformant has not turned up before this Court to prove her case. Steps under\nSection 82 CrPC already effected against her. Same is the case of CW4,\nanother occurrence witness. The only occurrence witness is PW3. A perusal\nof her testimony would reveal that she has no consistent version. On the one\nhand she deposes that she has only hearsay knowledge about the alleged\ncruely and on the other hand during the cross-examination she deposes to\nhave witness the quarrel between the Informant and her husband.\nInterestingly, when question was put to her as to why the same does not find\na place in the statement given by her to the Police, she would say that she\ncannot state something which she doesn’t know. Furthermore, it has come\nout in evidence through her cross-examination that she has acquaintance\nwith the Informant who used to take her to the temple and further that she\ngot acquainted with the mother of the Informant who had travelled with her\nin a bus. The most that could be gathered from her version is that there were\nsome discords between the Informant and the 1* Accused.\n\n6\n\nIn wake of the said circumstances, this Court is not satisfied therefore\nthat the Prosecution has succeeded in proving the ingredients of S.498 (A) of\nthe IPC beyond reasonable doubt. This point is therefore answered in favour\nof the Accused Persons.\n7. Point b: In the light of the finding in Point (a), this Point therefore\ndoes not arise for consideration.\n8. In the result, the Accused 1 to 3 are found not guilty of having\ncommitted the offence punishable under Section 498A r/w 34 of the IPC.\nThey are acquitted u/s. 248(1) of the CrPC of the said offence. Their bail\nbonds stand cancelled and they are set at liberty.\n\n(Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her,\ncorrected by me and pronounced in open Court, on this the 27\" day of\nJanuary, 2025.)\n\nJudicial First Class Magistrate-I,\nThiruvananthapuram.\nAPPENDIX\nA:Prosecution witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nPW1 Muhammed Rajan(CW9) Police Officials\nexamined on 04.05.2024\nPW2 Mohanan K G(CW10) Police Officials\nexamined on 04.05.2024\nPW3 Nirmala (CW2)examined on  |Eye witness\n23.07.2024\n\n7\nB: Defence witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nC: Court witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA.
