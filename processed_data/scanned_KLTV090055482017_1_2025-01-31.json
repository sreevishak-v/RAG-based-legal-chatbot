The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: The Accused was the rider of\nAutorickshaw bearing Registration No. Kl 01 BL 6120 . He drove the vehicle from\nManvila to Arasumoodu rashly, negligently and in such a manner as to endanger\nhuman life through Manvila—Arasumoodu road about 7.30 am on 24.06.2017 and hit\nthe since deceased who was riding bicycle bearing Registration Number KL 02 T 2743,\nnear the road turning to the Government Relief L.P. School Kulathoor, while suddenly\nturning the auto to enter into the said road. CW3 was the pillion rider. Due to its\nimpact, the since Deceased fell on the road and sustained grievous injuries on his head\nand body. CW3 also sustained severe injury. Thereafter, on 24.06.2017, at 12.50 AM,\nthe since deceased succumbed to his injuries at the Govt. Medical College Hospital,\nwhile undergoing treatment. Thus, the Accused is alleged to have committed the\nabove stated offences.\n\n3\n\n3. On the basis of the Final Report, the cognizance was taken for the offences\nunder Section 279, 337 and 304A of the IPC and summons was issued to the Accused\nherein. On issuance of process, the Accused entered appearance and he was enlarged\non bail. He was represented by a Counsel of his own choice. Copies of all the\nProsecution records were furnished to him. The particulars of offences under Sections\n279,337 and 304A of the IPC were read over and explained to the Accused and he\nunderstood the same, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.\n4. From the side of Prosecution, CWs 1, 2,5 and 19 were examined as PW1 to PW4\nrespectively and Exhibits P1 to P18 were marked. The Prosecution further failed to\nprocure the presence of CW3 and CW4, despite granting sufficient opportunities and\nthe Prosecution evidence was closed. Since no incriminating circumstances arose from.\nthe deposition of the witnesses, the examination of the Accused under Section 313(1)\n(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter referred to as the “‘CrPC’) was\ndispensed with. No evidence adduced on behalf of the Accused.\n5. Heard both sides and perused relevant documents. The following points arise\nfor consideration.\n\n(a) Has the Accused driven his vehicle rashly, negligently and in a manner\n\nlikely to endanger human life and thereby committed the offence punishable\n\nunder Section 279 of the IPC as alleged?\n\n4\n\n(b) Has the Accused by his act of having driven the vehicle in the said\n\nmanner caused hurt to since deceased and CW3 and thereby committed the\n\noffence punishable u/S. 337 IPC as alleged?\n\nc. Has the Accused driven his vehicle in the said manner resulting the\n\nsince deceased to succumb to his injuries and thereby committed the offence\n\npunishable under Section 304A of the IPC as alleged?\n\nd. If so, what shall be the proper sentence?\n\n6. Points (a) to (c): These points are considered together for the sake of brevity\nand to avoid repetition.\n\nPW1 deposed that the since deceased is his nephew and that the incident\noccurred at 2017, around 7.30. AM at Manvila. He deposed that he was informed of\nthe same by the mother of since deceased. When he reached the hospital, the since\ndeceased was under treatment at casuality. The accident occurred when the bike\ndriven by the since deceased got hit by a autorickshaw and that his death occurred on\nthe same day then, at the hospital. He further deposed that based on the information,\nhe gave Exhibit P1 statement to the police.\n\nPW2 deposed that since deceased is his son. The deceased died in the incident\nin this case at 2012 June 23. He was aged nearly 18 years on the said date. He came to\nknow about the incident when he was informed of the same by his wife. He had not\n\n5\ngone in the bike from the house, rather he had walked and later got into his friend’s\nbike. He deposed that he never used to give bike to the since deceased, although he\nused to ride motorcycles.\n\nPWS deposed that he lives in Arasumoodu. He is a trade Union employee. He\ndoes not have any previous acquaintance with the since deceased. He was coming on\nthe said route after unloading and found an auto and bike lying therein having\ncollided with each other. He heard that the injured were taken to the hospital. The\nincident occurred in 2017, but he doesn’t remember its number and denied having\ngiven statement to the police. He further denied having given statement to the police\nto the effect that he saw the auto driven by the Accused hitting the bike of the since\ndeceased and that the injured were thrown away from the bike due to its impact. This\nwas so when his attention was drawn to his previous statement by the Learned APP.\n\nThe Officer who had registered the crime was examined as PW4. He deposed\nthat he was the Assistant Sub Inspector of Police, City Traffic Police Station during the\nrelevant period of time and that he recorded the statement of PW1. On the basis of the\nExhibit P1 statement, he registered Exhibit P3 First Information Report for the offences\npunishable under Sections.279, 337 and 304 A of the IPC. He identified the records\nprepared by the Investigating Officer, CW20 who is laid up. He is acquainted with the\nsignature and handwriting of the Investigating Officer. Exhibit P6 is the Scene\nMahazar prepared by CW20 after visiting the place of occurrence. Exhibit P7 is the\n\n6\n\nInquest Report of deceased. Exhibit P9 is the Mahazar pertaining to the licence of the\nAccused. Exhibits P9, P10 and P11 are the Mahazars of the records of the vehicle\nrespectively. Exhibits P14 is the Wound certificate. Exhibit P1 is the postmortem\ncertificate. Exhibit P16 is the scene plan prepared by village officer. The Accused was\nreleased on bail upon Exhibit P17 Bail Bond. Exhibit P18 is the report reflecting the\ncorrect name and address of the Accused and after completing the investigation, PW4\nfiled Final Report.\n\nOn going through the evidence on the record, it can be seen that PW1 does not\nhave any direct knowledge as to the commission of the offence. Further, the witnesses\nwho claimed to have seen the incident deposed against the version of the Prosecution.\nThe contradiction in the statement of the occurrence witness is not proved. The other\noccurrence witnesses did not turn before this Court despite effecting steps under\nSection 82 of the CrPC. The remaining witnesses were given up by the Learned\nAssistant Public Prosecutor. In absence of any other corroborating circumstances,\nexcept for the documents put forth by PW1 and his oral testimony, there is nothing on\nrecord so as to implicate the Accused in this crime. There are no independent\nwitnesses examined before this Court. There is nothing on record as revealed from the\ndeposition of the witnesses so as to implicate the Accused to the alleged incident that\nthe Accused had driven his car in a rash and negligent manner, causing the injured to\nsuccumb to his injuries. The Prosecution has failed to substantiate its case by adducing\n\n7\nproper evidence and thereby failed to prove the guilt of the Accused beyond\nreasonable doubt. Hence Points (a) to (c) are found in favour of the Accused.\n7. Point d: In light of the above, since those points are found in favour of the\nAccused, question of sentencing the Accused does not arise.\n8. In the result, the Accused is found not guilty of having committed the offence\npunishable under Sections 279, 337 and 304 A of the IPC. Hence, the Accused is\nacquitted of the said offences under section 255(1) of the CrPC. His bail bond stands\ncancelled and he is set at liberty.\n(Dictated to my Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected by me\nand pronounced in open court on this the 31* day of January, 2025)\nJudicial Magistrate of First Class-I\nThiruvananthapuram\nAPPENDIX\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical witness,\nOther witness\nPWI1 Sinu K(CW1) examined Occurrence Witness\non12-09-2023\nPW2 G Suresh Kumar (CW2) Occurrence witness\nexamined on 20-11-2024\nPWS —S*iBareahs Kamar (CW)\n\n8\nexamined on 20.11.2024 Po\nPW4 S Jayakumar R(CW19) Police Officials\nexamined on 19.12.2024\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical witness,\nOther witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical witness,\nOther witness\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA.
