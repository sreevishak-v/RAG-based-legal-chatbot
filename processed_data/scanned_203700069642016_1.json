The defacto complainant alleged that, on 24/2/2015 at\np.m., the accused trespassed into his house and caused bodily\ninjuries on him using a knife.

Though the conduct of the petitioner and the allegations\nmay prima facie appear to be serious of having trespassed into the\nhouse of the defacto complainant and attacked both sides of his\nbody with knife, it was pointed out by the learned counsel for the\npetitioner that the only a small knife attached to the nail cutter was\nused.
