This case arose on the Final Report filed by Sub Inspector of Police, City\nTraffic Police Station in Crime No. 4699/2016 for the offences punsihable under\nSections 279 and 304 A of the Indian Penal Code (hereinafter referred to as the\n‘TPC’).\n2. The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: The Accused was the rider\nof Motor Cycle bearing Registration No. KL 01-BH-1045. He drove the vehicle from\nPoojappura to Thirumala via Poojappura-Thirumala road rashly, negligently, at\nhigh speed and in such a manner as to endanger human life, at 8.00 PM on\n27.10.2016 and hit the since deceased, who is the brother-in-law of CW1 near\nHindustan Latex who was crossing the road. Due to its impact, the since Deceased\nfell on the road and sustained grievous injuries on his head and body. Thereafter,\non 28.10.16 the since Deceased succumbed to the injuries at the KIMS Hospital,\nwhile undergoing treatment. Thus, the Accused is alleged to have committed the\nabove stated offences.\n3. On the basis of the Final Report, the cognizance was taken of the offences\nunder Section 279 and 304 A of the IPC and summons was issued to the Accused\nherein. On issuance of the process, the Accused herein entered appearance and he\nwas enlarged on bail. He was represented by a Counsel of his own choice. Copies\nof all the Prosecution records were furnished to him. The particulars of offences\n\nunder Sections 279 and 304A of the IPC were read over and explained to him. He\nunderstood the same, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.\n\n4. From the side of Prosecution, CWs1 and 14 were examined as PW1 and PW2\nrespectively and Exhibits P1 to P12 were marked. The presence of CWs 4 and 5\ncould not be procured by the Prosecution, despite steps having been executed\nagainst them. The remaining witnesses, were given up by the Prosecution and the\nProsecution evidence was closed. Since no incriminating circumstances arose from\nthe deposition of the witnesses against the Accused, his examination under Section\n313(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter referred to as the ‘CrPC’)\nwas dispensed with. No evidence was adduced on behalf of the Accused.\n\n5. Heard both sides and perused relevant documents. The following points\narise for consideration.\n\na. Has the Accused driven his vehicle rashly, negligently, at high speed\n\nand in a manner likely to endanger human life and thereby committed the\n\noffence punishable under Section 279 of the IPC as alleged?\n\nb. Has the Accused driven his vehicle rashly, negligently, at high speed\n\nand in a manner likely to endanger human life, resulting in the since\n\ndeceased to succumb to his injuries and thereby committed the offence\npunishable under Section 304A of the IPC as alleged?\n\nCc. If so, what shall be the proper sentence?\n\n6. Points a and b: These points are considered together for the sake of\nbrevity and to avoid repetition.\n\nCW1 was examined as PW1. He deposed that he is a doctor. The deceased\nwas his brother-in-law. He further deposed that he had given Exhibit P1 statement\nto the police regarding the incident. He deposed that he doesn’t have direct\nknowledge of the incident and got information over phone that his brother-in-law\nwas hit by a motorcycle.\n\nPW2 deposed that he was the Sub Inspector of Police, City Traffic Police\nStation during the relevant period of time and that he recorded the statement of\nPW1. On the basis of FIS, he prepared Exhibit P9 FIR for the offence punishable\nunder sections. 279 and 304 A of the IPC. Exhibit P3 is the Scene Mahazar\nprepared by him after visiting the place of occurrence. Exhibit P4 is the Inquest\nReport of since deceased prepared by him in presence of the witnesses. Exhibit\nP5 (marked subject to proof) is the Postmortem Report, which reflected that the\ndeath was due to the head injury. Ext P6 is the Vehicle Mahazar of the offending\nvehicle prepared by him. Exhibit P7 is the report of the MVI pursuant to\ninspection of the offending vehicle and Exhibit P8 is the third-party bail bond\ntowards release of the said vehicle. Exhibit P11 is the report reflecting the correct\nname and address of the Accused. Exhibit P12 is the Scene plan prepared by\nVillage Officer. He deposed that after completing the investigation, he filed Final\nReport.\n\nOn going through the evidence on the record, it can be seen that none of the\noccurrence witnesses have been examined. CWs 2 and 3, the occurrence witnesses\nwere given up by the Prosecution as early as in the year 2019. The presence of\nCWs 4 and 5 could not be procured by the Prosecution, despite steps having been\nissued against them. Thus, the Prosecution has miserably failed to procure\npresence of the remaining witnesses in this case. The only witness examined is the\nInvestigating Officer, i.e, PW2. There are no independent witnesses examined\nbefore this Court. In fact, there are no materials to infer and conclude that the\nAccused had driven his vehicle rashly, negligently, in high speed and in a manner\nas to endanger human life, thereby causing the injured to succumb to his injuries.\nThe Prosecution has failed to substantiate its case by adducing proper evidence\nand thereby failed to prove the guilt of the Accused beyond reasonable doubt.\nHence Points (a) and (b) are found against the Prosecution.\n\n7. Point (c): In light of analysis of the points hereinabove, since those are\nfound in favour of the Accuse, question of sentencing the Accused does not arise.\n\n8. In the result, the Accused is found not guilty of having committed the\n\noffence punishable under Sections 279 and 304 A of the IPC. Hence, the Accused is\n\nacquitted of the said offences under Section 255(1) of the CrPC. His bail bond\n\nstands canceled and he is set at liberty.\n\n(Dictated to my Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected by\n\nme and pronounced in open court on this the 15\" day of January, 2025)\n\nJudicial Magistrate of First Class-I\nThiruvananthapuram\nAPPENDIX\n\nA: Prosecution Witness\n\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\n\n1 Dr. Bindhulal(CW1)examined on Occurrence witness\n\n01.10.2019\n2 Asoka N T (CW14) examined on Police Witness\n15.10.2024\n\nB: Defence witness\n\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\n\nC: Court witness\n\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\n\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA.
