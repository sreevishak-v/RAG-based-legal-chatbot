CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n10.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE\nFOLLOWING:\n\nPSR et\n2024/KER/1595\nCRL.M.C.No.208/2024 ;\nSOPHY THOMAS, J\n—CrL.M.C.Mo.208 of 2024\nDated this the 10\" day of January, 2024\nORDER\n\nThis is a petition under Section 482 of CrPC filed by the\nsole accused in SC 183/2020 on the file of the Fast Track\nSpecial Court, Thalassery, for quashing Annexure-3 order dated\n24.11.2023.\n\n2. The petitioner filed Section 311 CrPC petition as\nCrl.M.P.No.532/2023 before the Fast Track Special Court,\nThalassery, for recalling the victim boy, who was examined as\nPW1 on 04.10.2023. According to learned counsel for the\npetitioner, some material questions were omitted to be asked\nduring cross-examination. He filed an application under\nSection 311 CrPC earlier also, but it was dismissed for default.\nSubsequently, he filed Crl.M.P.No.532/2023, for the very same\npurpose.\n\n3. The learned trial Judge in paragraph 7 of Annexure-\n3 order has stated that, on which aspect the witness has to be\nquestioned further, was not clear from the petition filed by\nhim. More over, the victim was cross-examined in detail on\n\nPSR et\n2024/KER/1595\nCRL.M.C.No.208/2024 3\n04.10.2023. The victim boy was aged only 13 years, at the\ntime of the alleged incident in the year 2018. So the Court\nfound that there is no need for a further cross-examination of\nPW1.\n\nLearned counsel for the petitioner would contend that the\nmatter is settled and the parents of the victim boy turned\nhostile to the prosecution. Hostility of witnesses cannot be\ntermed as settlement always. Since PW1 was cross-examined\nin detail on 04.10.2023 and the questions omitted to be asked\nduring his cross-examination will not find a place in the\npetition, this Court finds no illegality and impropriety in\nAnnexure-3 order. So this Crl.M.C. stands dismissed.\n\nThe petitioner is at liberty to file a fresh application,\nbefore the trial court stating the factum of settlement and the\nlearned Sessions Judge on ascertaining the factual situation\nfrom the parents of the victim, is at liberty to entertain such\napplication, and to pass orders in accordance with law.\n\nSd/-\nSOPHY THOMAS\nJUDGE\nACR\n\nEre\na ere\n2024/KER/1595\nCRL.M.C.No.208/2024\nwA..\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 208/2024\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES\nAnnexure-1 TRUE COPY OF THE DEPOSITION DATED\n04.10.2023 MADE BY PW1i IN SC\nNO.183/2020 BEFORE THE FAST TRACK\nSPECIAL COURT, THALASSERY.\nAnnexure-2 TRUE COPY OF THE PETITION DATED\n23.011.2023 FILED BY THE PETITIONER\nUNDER SEC.311 CR.P.C\nAnnexure-3 TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER DATED\n24.11.2023 IN CRL.M.P.NO.532/2023 IN\nSC NO.183/2020 OF THE FAST TRACK\nSPECIAL COURT, THALASSERY\n\n"
