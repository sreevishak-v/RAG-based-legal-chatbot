This is a case charge sheeted by the Sub Inspector of Police, Pettah Police Station in\n\n2\ncrime No. 981/2016 alleging commission of offences u/s 323, 324, 294(b),\n506(i) r/w 34 of IPC. Cognizance is not taken for the offence punishable u/s\n294(b) of IPC.\n\n2. The prosecution case in brief is that the accused due to enmity towards CW1\nand in furtherance of their common intention, on 07/08/2016 at 11 am, at the\nbyroad from Attuvarambu Road near Chackai YMA Hall, the accused came in\na bike, shouted abusive terms at CW1 and criminally intimidated by\nthreatening to kill him. The 1* accused also hit CW1 with a helmet which was\na dangerous weapon when used as a weapon of offence, the 2\"! accused also\nfisted CW1 on his chest and face. The accused thereby committed the\noffences as alleged against them.\n\n3. Accused Nos. 1 and 2 appeared on summons and they were furnished with\ncopies of all relevant prosecution records. After hearing, charge for the\noffences u/s 323, 324, 506(i) r/w 34 of IPC was framed and it was read over\nand explained to them and they pleaded not guilty.\n\n4. To prove their case, the prosecution examined CW1 to CW3 as PW1 to PW3\nand marked a document as Ext.P1. Since the witnesses examined did not\nsupport the prosecution, CW4 to CW14 were given up by the learned APP.\nHence, the prosecution evidence was closed. As there were no incriminating\ncircumstances brought out in evidence against accused, examination u/s 313\nof Cr.P.C was not necessary. The accused did not adduce any evidence.\n\n5. Heard both the sides.\n\n6. The points that arise for consideration are:-\n\n1. Whether the accused had committed the offences punishable u/s 323,\n324, 506(i) r/w 34 of IPC, as alleged?\n\n3\n2. What shall be the sentence or order?\n\n7. Point No.1 :- The evidence in this case consists of depositions of 3 witnesses\nand 1 document from the side of the prosecution. PW1 is the sole injured in\nthis case. He affirmed the occurrence and admitted Ext.P1 FI Statement given\nto police. He deposed that he could identify the assailants, but they were not\nthe accused herein. As per PW1, the names of the accused were stated upon\nhearsay. PW2 and PW3 cited as occurrence witnesses denied having\nwitnessed the alleged incident. Thus, all the material witnesses turned hostile\nto prosecution. Therefore, the learned Assistant Public Prosecutor gave up the\nremaining witnesses. From the above evidence, there is nothing to prove the\noccurrence as alleged or to connect the accused with the offences. Thus, the\nprosecution failed to prove that the accused committed the offences u/s 323,\n324, 506(i) r/w 34 of IPC. Point No.1 is found against the prosecution.\n\n8. Point No.2 :- In view of my finding on point no.1, the accused Nos. 1 and 2\nare found not guilty of the offences punishable u/s 323, 324, 506(i) r/w 34 of\nIPC they are acquitted u/s 248(1) of Cr.PC and set at liberty, cancelling their\nbail bonds.\n\nProperty produced in this case as T 473/2016 helmet, being valueless, shall be\ndestroyed. Property produced as T 448/2016 Motor Cycle bearing registration\nNo. KL-01-BD-5135 released on kychit is hereby made absolute.\n\nDictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected\n\nand pronounced by me in open Court on this the 28\" day of February 2025.\n\ne\noe) Elsa Catherine George\nCams Additional Chief J udicial Magistrate\nEES 2 Thiruvananthapuram\n\n4\nAPPENDIX\nWitnesses for Prosecution\nPW1 Jose\nPWw2 Manikutty\nPW3 Sunitha\nExhibits for Prosecution\nP1 FI Statement dated 07/08/2016 by PW1\nWitnesses and Exhibits for the defence\nNIL\nMaterial Objects\nNIL\nÂ¢\n32\nElsa Catherine George,\nAdditional Chief Judicial Magistrate,\nThiruvananthapuram.\nSree a\n\n"
