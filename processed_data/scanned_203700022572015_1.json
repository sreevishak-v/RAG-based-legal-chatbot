No.3385/2012 on the files of the Judicial First\nClass Magistrate's Court, Alathur registered for the\noffences punishable under Section 498A read with\nSection 34 of the Indian Penal Code. The prosecution\nallegation is that the accused, in furtherance of their\ncommon intention to get more money and gold from\nthe de facto complainant, subjected her to physical\nand mental cruelty demanding more money and gold\nornaments. Therefore the prosecution alleges that\nthe accused is guilty of the aforesaid offences. After\ninvestigation, Annexure—-A final report has been filed\nbefore the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court,\nAlathur.\n\n2. In this petition, it is stated that the dispute\nbetween the petitioners and the de facto complainant\n\nesr\n\nCrl.M.C.2257/15-B :2: 2015/KER/17256\nhas been settled amicably and now the first\nrespondent does not want to continue the present\nprosecution any further. It is further stated that the\nfirst petitioner and the first respondent are now\nliving together as husband and wife. Under the above\ncircumstances, the petitioners filed this Cr1.M.C. for\nquashing the entire prosecution proceedings against\nthe petitioners under Annexure-A final report,\ninvoking the jurisdiction and power under Section 482\n\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure. The first\nrespondent has filed Annexure-B affidavit stating\nthat they have settled the entire dispute and now the\nfirst respondent does not want to proceed with the\nprosecution.\n\n3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners,\nthe learned Public Prosecutor and the learned counsel\nfor the first respondent.\n\n4. The learned counsel for the petitioners cited\nGian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)] and\nsubmitted that even though the offence under Section\n\nae\nCrl.M.C.2257/15-B 23: 2015/KER/17256\n498A is a non-compoundable offence, the same can be\ncompounded in exercise of jurisdiction under Section\n482 of the Cr.P.C., if the parties have settled the\ndispute out of court.\n\n5. I have meticulously considered the decision\nlaid down in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT\n108 (SC)]. In the above case, three Judge Bench of the\nApex Court, on a reference, considered the question\nwhether the High Court has power to quash criminal\nproceedings involving non-compoundable offences on\nthe basis of the compromise reached between the\noffender and the victim and answered as given below:\n\n“57. The position that emerges from the above\ndiscussion can be summarised thus: the power\nof the High Court in quashing a criminal\nproceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise\nof its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and\ndifferent from the power given to a criminal\ncourt for compounding the offences under\n$.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide\nplenitude with no statutory limitation but it\nhas to be exercised in accord with the\nguideline engrafted in such power viz:(i) to\nsecure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent\nabuse of the process of any Court. In what\ncases power to quash the criminal proceeding\nor complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where\nthe offender and victim have settled their\ndispute would depend on the facts and\ncircumstances of each case and no category\n\nrapes oa\nCrl.M.C.2257/15-B 24: 2015/KER/17256\ncan be prescribed. However, before exercise\nof such power, the High Court must have due\nregard to the nature and gravity of the crime.\nHeinous and serious offences of mental\ndepravity or offences like murder, rape,\ndacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed",

I have meticulously considered the decision\nlaid down in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT\n108 (SC)]. In the above case, three Judge Bench of the\nApex Court, on a reference, considered the question\nwhether the High Court has power to quash criminal\nproceedings involving non-compoundable offences on\nthe basis of the compromise reached between the\noffender and the victim and answered as given below:\n\n“57. The position that emerges from the above\ndiscussion can be summarised thus: the power\nof the High Court in quashing a criminal\nproceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in exercise\nof its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and\ndifferent from the power given to a criminal\ncourt for compounding the offences under\n$.320 of the Code. Inherent power is of wide\nplenitude with no statutory limitation but it\nhas to be exercised in accord with the\nguideline engrafted in such power viz:(i) to\nsecure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent\nabuse of the process of any Court. In what\ncases power to quash the criminal proceeding\nor complaint or F.I.R. may be exercised where\nthe offender and victim have settled their\ndispute would depend on the facts and\ncircumstances of each case and no category\n\nrapes oa\nCrl.M.C.2257/15-B 24: 2015/KER/17256\ncan be prescribed. However, before exercise\nof such power, the High Court must have due\nregard to the nature and gravity of the crime.\nHeinous and serious offences of mental\ndepravity or offences like murder, rape,\ndacoity, etc., cannot be fittingly quashed even\nthough the victim or victim's family and the\noffender have settled the dispute. Such\noffences are not private in nature and have\nserious impact on society. Similarly, any\ncompromise between the victim and offender\nin relation to the offences under special\nstatutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or\nthe offences committed by public servants\nwhile working in that capacity etc: cannot\nprovide for any basis for quashing criminal\nproceedings involving such offences. But the\ncriminal cases having overwhelmingly and\npre-dominatingly civil flavour stand on\ndifferent footing for the purposes of\nquashing, particularly the offences arising\nfrom commercial, financial, mercantile, civil,\npartnership or such like transactions or the\noffences arising out of matrimony relating to\ndowry, etc., or the family disputes where the\nwrong is basically private or personal in\nnature and the parties have resolved their\nentire dispute. In this category of cases, High\nCourt may quash criminal proceedings if in\nits view, because of the compromise between\nthe offender and victim, the possibility of\nconviction is remote and bleak = and\ncontinuation of criminal case would put\naccused to great oppression and prejudice and\nextreme injustice would be caused to him by\nnot quashing the criminal case despite full\nand complete settlement and compromise with\nthe victim. In other words, the High Court\nmust consider whether it would be unfair or\ncontrary to the interest of justice to\ncontinue with the criminal proceeding or\ncontinuation of the criminal proceeding\nwould tantamount to abuse of process of law\ndespite settlement and compromise between\n\nBERRI\neae\nraphe a\nCrl.M.C.2257/15-B 5: 2015/KER/17256\nthe victim and wrongdoer and whether to\nsecure the ends of justice, it is appropriate\nthat criminal case is put to an end and if the\nanswer to the above question(s) is in\naffirmative, the High Court shall be well\nwithin its jurisdiction to quash the criminal\nproceeding.”\n\n6. In view of the proposition laid down above, the\nquestion to be considered, in the instant case, is,\nwhether the non-compoundable offence involved in\nthis case can be compounded, in the exercise of the\ninherent power under Section 482 of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure. Prima facie, I find that the\noffences alleged against the petitioners will not\ncome under the category of non-compoundable\noffences, which are specifically excluded from\ncomposition, in the exercise of inherent power under\nSec.482 of the Cr.P.C. Going by the affidavit filed by\nthe de facto complainant, it is seen that the dispute\nbetween the accused and the victim had been amicably\nsettled and at present the de facto complainant has\nno subsisting grievance at all. The de facto\ncomplainant does not want to proceed with the\nprosecution against the accused. Full and final\n\nBeier\n\nCrl.M.C.2257/15-B :6: 2015/KER/17256\nsettlement and compromise with the victim are\nevidenced by Annexure-B. In view of the compromise\nbetween the petitioners and the victim, I find that the\npossibility of conviction is remote, bleak, and\ncontinuation of the criminal case would put the\nparties to great oppression, prejudice and also\ntantamount to abuse of the process of the court. The\npresent criminal prosecution against the accused\nmust be put to an end to secure the interest of\njustice.\n\n7. In this analysis, the prosecution proceedings\nagainst the petitioners under Annexure-A _ final\nreport will stand quashed.\n\nThis petition is allowed.\n\nSd/-\n(K.HARILAL, JUDGE)\nokb.\n\n"
