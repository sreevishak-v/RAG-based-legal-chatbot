This is a case instituted upon the Final report filed by Sub Inspector of\nPolice, City Traffic Police Station in Crime No. 3687/2013 for the offences\npunishable under Sections 279, 337 and 338 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860\n(hereinafter referred to as ‘the IPC’).\n2. The Prosecution allegations in brief are as follows: The Accused was the\ndriver of the KSRTC bus bearing registration No. RRC 803. He drove it rashly,\nnegligently and in a manner so as to endanger human life, or to be likely to cause\nhurt or injury at about 6.30 pm on 12.06.2013 from Vellayambalam to\nAmbalamukku on Vellayambalam -Ambalamukku road. It hit the motorcycle\nbearing Registration No. KL 21 D3194 which was driven by the Informant. Due to\nits impact, the Informant fell down on the road and sustained serious injury to his\nright knee and left palm causing contusion and swelling. Further he also sustained\nfracture in his finger. Thus, the Accused is thereby alleged to have committed the\nabove stated offences.\n3. This Court took cognizance upon the Final Report in respect of offences\nunder Sections 279, 337 and 338 of the IPC. On issuance of process, the Accused\nentered appearance. He was enlarged on bail. He was represented by a Counsel of\nhis own choice. Copies of all relevant prosecution records were furnished to him.\nAfter preliminary hearing, the particulars of offences under Sections 279, 337, 338\nof the IPC were read over and explained to the Accused, to which he pleaded not\nguilty and claimed to be tried.\n\n3\n4. From the side of Prosecution, CWs1 and 3 were examined as PWs 1 and 2\nrespectively and Exhibit P1 marked. The presence of CWs2, 4, 5 and 11 could not\nbe procured by the Prosecution. Report also filed to the effect that the presence of\nCWs 2 and 11 cannot be procured in near future and that CW11 is a cancer\npatient, who is laid up. Further steps under Section 82 of the CrPC were effected\nagainst CWs 4 and 5. The remaining witnesses were given up by the Learned APP\nas the material witnesses had turned hostile to the case of Prosecution. Since no\nincriminating circumstances arose from the depositions of the witnesses, the\nexamination of the Accused under Section 313(1)(b) of the CrPC was dispensed\nwith. No Defence evidence was adduced.\n5. Heard both sides and perused relevant documents. The following points\narise for consideration.\na. Has the Accused driven the aforesaid vehicle rashly, negligently, in a\nmanner endangering the life of PW1, causing injury to him and thereby\ncommitted the offence punishable under Section 279 of the IPC as alleged?\nb. Has the Accused driven the aforesaid vehicle and rashly, negligently\nin a manner endangering the life and personal safety to PW1, caused hurt to\nher and thereby committed the offence punishable under Section 337 IPC as\nalleged?\nCc. Has the Accused by so driving the aforesaid vehicle in the manner\naforesaid caused grievous hurt to PW1 and thereby committed the offence\npunishable under Section 338 of the IPC as alleged?\nd. If so, the proper sentence to be awarded?\n6. Points (a) to (c): These points are considered together for the sake of\nbrevity and to avoid repetition.\nPWI1 deposed that he sustained injury in the incident occurred on 12.06.138\nat Ambalamukku at 6.30 pm, while he was on his way back home to Venkode after\n\n4\n\nhis work. According to him, KSRTC Bus had hit on the backside of his motor cycle\nduring the display of the green traffic signal. He sustained injury on his left hand\nand right knee. He went to Govt. Medical College Hospital for treatment. He\ndeposed that he gave Exhibit P1 Statement to the police. However, he denied\nidentification of the bus, the depo, the reason for the incident and further that he\nhad not seen the person who allegedly drove the vehicle. PW2 also denied having\nwitnessed the incident and having given statement to that effect.\n\nOn going through the evidence and the materials on record, it is pertinent to\nnote that though PW1 admits of having sustained injuries in the incident, he has no\ncase that it was on account of rash or negligent driving of the Accused himself. In\nfact, PW1 categorically deposed that he had not seen the driver of the KSRTC Bus\nthat had hot on the back of his motor cycle and has no case that it was the Accused\nwho had so driven the vehicle as alleged by the Prosecution so as to implicate him.\nPW2, one of the occurrence witnesses also denied having witnessed the incident\nand turned hostile to the Prosecution. The presence of CWs2, 4, 5 and 11 could\nnot be procured by the Prosecution. The remaining witnesses were given up by the\nProsecution as the material witnesses, the injured himself, had turned hostile to\nthe Prosecution and also no purpose would be served in examining the remaining\nwitnesses in the said circumstance. Thus, there is nothing on record as revealed\nfrom the deposition of the witnesses so as to implicate the Accused to the alleged\nincident that the Accused by the aforesaid acts committed the above offences,\nhaving caused PW1 to sustain injuries. The Prosecution has thus failed to\nsubstantiate its case by adducing proper evidence and thereby failed to prove the\nguilt of the Accused beyond reasonable doubt. Hence these points are found in\nfavour of the Accused.\n\n7. Point d: In light of analysis of the points hereinabove, since those are found\nin favour of the Accused, no sentence is to be awarded to the Accused.\n\n8. In the result, the Accused is found not guilty of having committed the\noffence punishable under Sections 279, 337 and 338 of the IPC. Hence, the\n\n5\nAccused is acquitted of the said offence under section 255(1) of CrPC. His bail\nbond stands canceled and he is set at liberty.\n(Dictated to my Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected by\nme and pronounced in open court on this the 4\" day of December, 2024)\nJudicial Magistrate of First Class-I\nThiruvananthapuram\nAPPENDIX\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA: Prosecution witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nPW1 Ajikumar(CW1) examined |Occurrence witness\non 21-11-2016\nPW2 Venkitachalam(CW3) Other witness\nexamined on 06.03.19\nB: Defence witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\n\n6\n\nwitness, Medical\n=\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\n\nPolice witness, Expert\n\nwitness, Medical\n0 Er\n\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA.
