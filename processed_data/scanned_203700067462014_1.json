He is\ndirected by the learned Magistrate to execute a bond for 2\n1,50,000/- with two solvent sureties, to make deposit of 2\n45,000/- in court, and also to produce bank guarantee for the\nbalance amount of 1,05,000/-. He is aggrieved by the\nconditions directing production of bank guarantee and cash\ndeposit. It appears that the latest decision of this Court on the\npoint has not come to the notice of the learned Magistrate. This\nCourt has settled that in such cases the conditions imposed\nunder Section 451 Cr.P.C shall not be irrational.\n\n2. On a√© consideration of the facts and\ncircumstances, I feel that the third condition directing\nproduction of bank guarantee can be set aside, because the other\n\npare ta]\nie\n2015/KER/1273\nCrL.M.C No.6746 of 2014 2\nconditions will serve the purpose. As regards the other\nconditions, I do not find any scope for interference.\nIn the result, this Criminal Miscellaneous Case is\nallowed in part. The third condition imposed by the court below\nas per order dated 11.11.2014 in C.M.P No.9557/2014 directing\nthe petitioner to produce bank guarantee will stand set aside.\nP.UBAID\nJUDGE\nab\n\n"
