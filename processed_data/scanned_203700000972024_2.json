NOUSHAD K.A. (PP)\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n22.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nBape as ral\nahoh\n2024/KER/7383\nCRL.MC NO. 97 OF 2024\n2\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.\nCrl.M.C.No.97 of 2024\nDated this the 22\" day of January 2024\nORDER\n\nPetitioner is the accused in Crime No.731/2022 of Kannur Police\nStation, Kannur alleging offences under various provisions of the\nNarcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Stances Act, 1985. By Annexure Al\norder in B.A.No.5207/2022, this Court while granting bail to the\npetitioner in the aforementioned crime directed that he shall not involve\nin any other crime while on bail. In the meanwhile, petitioner is alleged\nto have involved in a serious offence, and is arrayed as 2™ accused in\nCrime No.236/2023 of Valapttanam Police Station for the offences under\nSections 392, 323, 364A and 365 r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal\nCode, 1860.\n\n2. In the latter case, which was allegedly committed while the\npetitioner was on bail, the prosecution alleged that the accused came in\na motor car and after abducting the defacto complainant and his friends\nrobbed their mobile phone and demanded ransom for its release.\nImmediately after commission of the second offence the Investigating\n\nBape as ral\nahoh\n2024/KER/7383\nCRL.MC NO. 97 OF 2024\n3\n\nOfficer in Crime No.731/2022 filed Crl.M.P. No.537/2022 seeking\ncancellation of bail granted to the accused for violation of the conditions.\nBy a detailed order dated 13.10.2023 produced as Annexure A Ill the\nlearned Sessions Judge cancelled the bail after noticing that the\nallegations do not indicate any false implication and also that the nature\nof offence alleged against the accused includes abduction, robbery and\ndemand of ransom, all of which are serious offences.\n\n3. Sri.Aswanth.P.T., learned Counsel for the petitioner\ncontended that the impugned order is not legally tenable, since the\ncourt had not considered various parameters for cancelling the bail. It is\nalso submitted that the learned Sessions Judge while cancelling the bail\nfailed to bear in mind the settled legal preposition that unless the liberty\ngranted to the accused would prejudice the conduct of trial, bail ought\nnot to be cancelled. The learned Counsel referring to the decision in\nGodson vs. State of Kerala 2022 ICO 1505 contended that the mere\nimplication of the accused in the subsequent offence by itself ought not\nto be a ground for cancellation of bail.\n\n4. Sri.K.A.Noushad, learned Public Prosecutor on the other hand\ncontended that petitioner committed a serious offence, which has a\ntendency to interfere with the trial. as the accused had abducted the\ndefacto complainant and demanded ramson, which can indirectly create\nfear and terror in the mind of the witnesses in the earlier case and\nthereby prejudice the trial and, if on that basis the bail is not cancelled\n\n2024/KER/7383\nCRL.MC NO. 97 OF 2024\n4\nthe witnesses in the NDPS case may not come forward to give evidence.\n\n5. Petitioner, though a young person of 24 years, is alleged to\nhave involved in NDPS offence in Crime No.731/2022 of Kannur Town\nPolice Station. He was released on bail by order dated 10.08.2022.\nWithin five months thereafter, he is alleged to have involved himself in\nCrime No.226/2023 of Valapattanam Police Station by committing a\nserious offence of abduction and demand of ransom.\n\n6. As rightly pointed out by the learned Public Prosecutor, the\ncondition imposed in Annexure AI bail order is that, he shall not involve\nin any other crime while on bail. Despite such conditions having been\nimposed by this Court, petitioner involved in a crime of a serious nature\nlike abduction and demand of ransom, certainly, it can spell out terror\nand fear in the mind of the witnesses, who are to be examined in Crime\nNo.731/2022 of Kannur Town police Station. If in total disregard of the\nconditions, petitioner has committed the offence and if the bail is not\ncancelled, the trial in the said crime can be prejudiced. Therefore, the\ncontention raised by the learned Counsel for the petitioner relying upon\nGodson’s case (supra) is not legally tenable.\n\n7. On a perusal of the impugned order and on considering the\ndecision in P vs. State of M.P. [2022 (7) SCALE 411], it is noticed\nthat the learned Sessions Judge has mentioned detailed reasons for\ncancelling the bail granted to the petitioner. It has also been specifically\nobserved that there is no reason to assume that petitioner has been\n\nBear\ni rte\nISR a\n2024/KER/7383\nCRL.MC NO. 97 OF 2024\n5\nfalsly implicated in the subsequent crime.\n\n8. Having regard to the above circumstances, | do not find any\nperversity with the impugned order and it is hence liable to be interfered\nwith.\n\nAccordingly, this Crl.M.C. is dismissed.\n\nsd/\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\njm/\n\nBee\nPEE ena\n|\nCapes te\n2024/KER/7383\nCRL.MC NO. 97 OF 2024\n6\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 97/2024\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES\nAnnexure AI TRUE COPY OF THE HON'BLE HIGH COURT OF KERALA\nIN B.A.NO 5207/2022 DATED 10.08.2022\nAnnexure AIT THE TRUE COPY OF THE HON'BLE SESSIONS COURT,\nTHALASSERY IN CRL.
