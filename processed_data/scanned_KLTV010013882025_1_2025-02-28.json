The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable\nunder Sections 296(b), 126(2), 351(3), 118(1) and 110 of the Bharatiya Nyaya\nSanhita, and Crime No. 166/2025 of Balaramapuram Police Station is registered\nagainst the petitioner arraying him as the accused.\n\nCriminal M.C.No.571/2025 1/5\n\n3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- On 04.02.2025 at\nabout 7.40 a.m., while the defacto complainant was driving his autorickshaw\nalong the Thembamuttom-Villikulam Road, and when the vehicle reached near\nKarathala Temple, the accused, who was riding a scooter along the said road,\nwrongfully restrained the defacto complainant, uttered abusive words against him,\nand thereafter, hacked him, using a knife, on his forehead, nose and right knee,\ncausing injuries.\n\n4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The\nInvestigating Officer filed report opposing the anticipatory bail application.\n\n5. Heard. Perused the records.\n\n6. | The only point to be considered is, whether an order of anticipatory\nbail can be granted to the petitioner/ accused.\n\n7. The Point:- The petitioner/accused was running a stationery store,\nand the defacto complainant was a regular customer in that store. It is alleged that,\nin view of some dispute between the two, in relation to the accounts maintained in\nthe stationery store regarding the purchase of provisions made by the defacto\ncomplainant, the petitioner/accused had assaulted the defacto complainant, using a\nknife.\n\n8. According to the petitioner, he is absolutely innocent of the\n\nCriminal M.C.No.571/2025 2/5\n\nallegations levelled against him and he has been falsely implicated in this case. It\nis submitted that, the petitioner is conducting a stationery store business, and the\ndefacto complainant, who is a regular customer in his shop, used to purchase\nstationary items, on credit basis, and while so, on 03.02.2025, the defacto\ncomplainant misbehaved with the lady staff of the shop and abused her and when\nthe petitioner questioned the same, on 04.02.2025, the defacto complainant, under\nthe influence of alcohol, chased and attacked the petitioner while he was returning\nhome, and he sustained injuries in the said incident and he took treatment from\nFamily Health Centre, Balaramapuram.\n\n9. There is serious allegation as against the petitioner. Going by the\nFirst Information Statement given by the defacto complainant, it is seen that, the\ndefacto complainant had purchased some stationery goods from the shop of the\naccused and some amount was due from the defacto complainant, and later, he had\npaid some amount, and there was a dispute between the two in not entering the\nsame, and thereafter, due to that animosity, the petitioner had attacked the defacto\ncomplainant while the defacto complainant was going in his autorickshaw. In the\nbody note appended to the First Information Statement, it is stated that, the wound\nof the defacto complainant over his forehead, nose and right leg were seen\ndressed. The case of the petitioner is that, when the petitioner questioned the\n\nCriminal M.C.No.571/2025 3/5\n\nmisbehavior of the defacto complainant with the lady staff of his shop, the defacto\ncomplainant had, in fact, attacked the petitioner, and that the petitioner sustained\ninjuries, and he was treated at Family Health Centre, Balaramapuram. Along with\nthe bail application, he had produced a prescription slip from Family Health\nCentre, Balaramapuram. Apparently, there is some dispute between the two in\nview of the purchase of stationery from the shop of the petitioner. In view of the\ndisparity between the two, an exaggeration of the case cannot be ruled out. No\nmaterial is produced by the prosecution, apart from the First Information Report,\nto show that, the allegation against the petitioner carries some weight. It would be\na travesty of justice, if the petitioner is put behind the bars, if actually he has not\ncommitted the offence. No criminal antecedents of the petitioner is brought to the\nnotice of this court.\n\n10. In view of my discussion above, it appears that there is no\nimpediment in granting a pre-arrest bail to the petitioner. Considering all these\naspects, it is found that this is a fit case where a pre-arrest bail can be granted to\nthe petitioner.\n\nIn the result, the petition is allowed",
