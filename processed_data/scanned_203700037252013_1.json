As per the report, out of the 7 accused\npersons, Al and A2 are facing trial now. A3 is no more and A4 to A7 are\nabsconding. It is reported that prosecution has cited 8 witnesses, of whom\nCws 1 to 7 were examined as PWi to PW7. The only remaining witness,\nthat is CW8, is a police officer who has failed to appear, in spite of summons\nbeing repeated and even after issuance of non bailable warrant. This court is\noften coming across instances where trial of criminal cases are being\ndelayed endlessly due to the deliberate absence of Investigating Officers.\nThis is an issue which should engage the attention of the Director General of\nProsecution. Such officers are ridiculing the justice delivery system and\nshould therefore be brought to book.\n\nIn view of the fact that only one more witness is to be examined, the\nJudicial Magistrate of First Class-II, Kannur is directed to take earnest efforts\nto dispose C.C.No.366 of 2006 within an outer limit of three months from\nthe date of receipt of a copy of this order.\n\nSd/-\nV.G.ARUN\nJUDGE\nIgk\n\nBuse\nLi ete]\nEle aS vs\n2021/KER/8\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S ANNEXURES:-\nANNEXURE Atl TRUE COPY OF FIR IN CRIME NO.87/2005 OF KANNUR\nTOWN POLICE STATION\nANNEXURE A2 TRUE COPY OF TRANSFER ORDER IN CRIMINAL MP\nNO.3604/2006 OF SESSIONS COURT, THALASSERY.\n\n"
