The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- The accused,\nwho was the staff of D.V.Finance, an institution run by the defacto complainant,\nwith an intention to obtain wrongful gain and to cause wrongful loss to the\ndefacto complainant, during the period from 12.09.2022 to 01.02.2025, made\nforged entries showing that 71 customers pledged their gold ornaments and\navailed a total sum of Rs.31,77,976/- towards gold loans, and obtained the\nbalance amount of Rs.1,96,722/- kept in the institution, and thus obtained a total\nsum of Rs.33,74,698/- from the institution.\n\n4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor.\nThe Investigating Officer filed report opposing the anticipatory bail application.\n\n5. Heard. Perused the records.\n\n6. The only point to be considered is, whether an order of\nanticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioner/ accused.\n\n7. The Point:- The defacto complainant is the Proprietor of an\ninstitution by name “D.V.Finance”, situated at Charottukonam. The petitioner/\naccused was the staff of the said institution. It is alleged that, the\npetitioner/accused, during the period from 12.09.2022 to 01.02.2025, made\nforged entries in the register showing that they allotted a total sum of\nRs.31,77,976/- towards gold loans to 71 persons, and _ she obtained\nRs.1,96,722/-, which was kept in the institution, and thus obtained a total sum of\n\nCriminal M.C.No.611/2025 2/6\n\nRs.33,74,698/- from the institution, and thereby cheated the defacto\ncomplainant.\n\n8. The petitioner submits that, she was working as a Clerk in the\nDevaram Kurries Private Limited, Plamoottukada, since 22.11.2006, and on\n14.09.2022, she had joined in the Charottukonam Branch, and one Vijayan D.,\nthe Managing Director of the said firm had filed a petition to the Station House\nOfficer, Pozhiyoor Police Station alleging that the petitioner had committed\nfinancial misappropriation while she was working in the said institution. It is\nsubmitted that, the actual fact is that, in December 2024, the petitioner\ninformed the Managing Director of Devaram Kurries that, she is going to\nresign from her job because of some illness and she had made a claim of\nRs.4,32,000/- towards her provident fund benefits. It is also submitted that, the\npetitioner resigned from D.V.Finance on 01.02.2025, and thereafter, in order to\nevade from the payment of the provident fund benefits, the said Vijayan had\nfabricated a story against the petitioner, and by influencing the Pozhiyoor\nPolice, he is trying to implicate the petitioner in this case. The defacto\ncomplainant also filed a complaint against one Tharakumari, who was the staff\nof the institution, for the above said reasons. The petitioner is suffering from\nvarious diseases. The petitioner produced the copies of the medical records and\ncopy of screen shot of text message from South Indian Bank, to substantiate her\ncontentions.\n\nCriminal M.C.No.611/2025 3/6\n\n9. There is serious allegation as against the petitioner. Going by the\nFirst Information Statement given by the defacto complainant, it is seen that,\nwhile working with D.V.Finance Company, the petitioner had cheated the\ndefacto complainant by fraudulently entering in the register that the customers\nhad pledged the gold ornaments and appropriating the money given by the\nCompany for her own purpose. It is also stated in the First Information\nStatement that the Day Book Register and Gold Pledging Register were\nmaintained and the misappropriation was traced out when the petitioner asked\nfor advance amount to be paid to the customer and on verification of the Gold\nPledge Register, the defacto complainant came to know of the\nmisappropriation. The contention of the petitioner is that she was only a Clerk\nin that institution and that the Managing Director was the custodian of the\nlocker, and the cash and gold locker were not handled by the petitioner. It is\nalso stated by the petitioner that regular audits were conducted by the officials\nof the company and if at all any financial misappropriation is noticed, it would\nhave been revealed in audit reports. Apparently, the prosecution has not\nbrought out any materials to show the commission of the offence by the\npetitioner. In the report submitted by the Investigating Officer, nothing is\nstated relating to the seizure of any documents, at least the so called Gold\nPledge Register or Day Book Register. Even in the First Information Statement\ngiven by the defacto complainant, there is no clarity as to the functioning of the\n\nCriminal M.C.No.611/2025 4/6\n\ninstitution and how the petitioner had cheated the defacto complainant. It is not\nclear whether without verification of the pledged gold, any amount was\nadvanced by the company. Significantly, the petitioner is only the Clerk of the\ninstitution and nothing is stated in the First Information Statement why the\nactivities of the petitioner is not managed by the superior officers or by way of\naudit for such a long period. The prosecution has not made out a prima facie\ncase as against the petitioner. It would be a travesty of justice, if the petitioner\nis put behind the bars, if she has not committed any offence. No criminal\nantecedents of the petitioner is brought to the notice of this court.\n\n10. In view of my discussion above, it appears that there is no\nimpediment in granting a pre-arrest bail to the petitioner. Considering all these\naspects, it is found that this is a fit case where a pre-arrest bail can be granted to\nthe petitioner.\n\nIn the result, the petition is allowed",
