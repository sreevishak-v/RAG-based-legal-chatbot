JUSTICE RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN V\nTUESDAY ,THE O8TH DAY OF JANUARY 2019 / 18TH POUSHA, 1940\nCri.MC.No. 8752 of 2018\nSC NO.530/2009 OF COURT OF ADDITIONAL DISTRICT & SESSIONS FOR THE\nTRIAL OF CASHES RELATING TO ATROCITIES AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE TOWARDS\nWOMEN AND CHILDREN AT KOZHIKODE\nCRIME NO.452/2008 OF MUKKOM POLICE STATION, KOZHIKODE\nPETITIONER/ACCUSED :\nKOLAKKODAN JAMALLUDHIN @ JAMAL,\nAGED 52 YEARS, S/O ABDHUL RAZAK,\nKOTTUPURATH (HOUSE), CHERUVADI, KODIYATHUR,\nKOZHIKODE DISTRICT.\nBY ADV. SRI.MOHANAN V.T.K.\nRESPONDENT/STATE:\nSTATE OF KERALA,\nREPRESENTED BY THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR,\nHIGH COURT OF KERALA,ERNAKULAM-682 031.\nBY SMT AMBIKA DEVI SPECIAL GOVERNMENT PLEADER\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n08.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nBe aeea!\nCr1.MC.No. 8752 of 2018 2 201/KERI962\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner herein is the 4 accused in S.C No.530 of 2009 on\nthe file of the Additional Sessions Judge, Kozhikode, in which case, he\nalong with others are being proceeded against for having committed\noffence punishable, inter alia, under Sections 366A, 372, 373 and\n376(g) of the IPC. He challenges Annexure-G order passed by the\nlearned Sessions Judge in C.M.P. No.481 of 2018, on an application\nfiled by the 6\" accused.\n\n2. TO appreciate the contentions advanced by the petitioner, a\nbrief narration of the events, which led to the filing of C.M.P.No.481 of\n2018, would be apposite.\n\n3. The above case relates to multiple acts of gross sexual\nabuse of a minor girl by a group of persons. As per the charge laid\nbefore the Court below, the accused Nos.i and 2 are the mother and\nstep-father respectively of the minor victim, who was aged about 13\nyears when the incident had taken place. In essence, the allegation\nagainst the accused as per the charge is that the 2™ accused, being\n\nBe aeea!\n\nCrl.MC.No. 8752 of 2018 3 2019/KERII62\nthe step-father, subjected the minor child to rape on numerous\noccasions during the summer vacation in the year 2007, with the\nknowledge and consent of the 1* accused. While the minor child was\nresiding with accused Nos. 1 and 2, the child was handed over by\nthem to the 5\" accused, after receiving money. The child was allegedly\ntaken by the 2™ accused in a car to Wayanad and she was subjected\nto penetrative sexual abuse by both the accused Nos.2 and 5.\nThereafter, the accused Nos. 1 and 2 are alleged to have handed over\nthe minor child to the 4\" accused, the petitioner herein, after receiving\nmoney. The accused Nos.1, 2 and 4 took the child to Ooty in the\nmonth of June, 2008, and after confining her in a resort, subjected her\nto rape. It is also alleged that the petitioner subjected the minor child\nto rape in the home of the 1* accused at Vallathayippara. Thereafter,\nthe accused Nos.1 and 2 are alleged to have entrusted the child to\naccused Nos.3, 5 to 7 and 9. They subjected her to rape in the houses\nbelonging to the 1* accused and also in a lodge by name Arora Tower\nat Kozhikkode, and various other places, including the house of the 6\"\nand the 9\" accused, and in vehicles.\n\n4. The court charge was framed against all the accused except\n\nBe aeea!\nCr1.MC.No. 8752 of 2018 4 201/KERI962\nthe petitioner herein. However, for some obscure reason, the same\nwent unnoticed.\n\n5. While the trial proceedings were pending, a petition was\nfiled by the 6\" accused before the learned Sessions Judge challenging\nthe legality of the charge framed against him. He contended that\ndistinct and separate incidents were clubbed together and as there is\nno commonality of purpose or continuity in action, the charge framed\nagainst him was illegal. The said petition was dismissed by the learned\nSessions Judge by order dated 2.3.2016 in C.M.P. No 486 of 2016.\n\n6. The above order was challenged by the 6\" accused before\nthis Court and by order dated 25.07.2018 in Crl.M.C.No.1616 of 2016,\nhis contentions were repelled and the petition was dismissed. Certain\nobservations were made concerning the incorporation of certain details\ninsofar as the accusation against the 6\" accused was concerned. This\nCourt left the matter to the discretion of the trial court to consider\nwhether the charge needs to be modified by adding those details.\nEven at this point of time, the inadvertent omission to frame the\ncharge was not noticed by anyone except may be by the 6\" accused.\n\nBe aeea!\nCr1.MC.No. 8752 of 2018 5 201/KERI962\n\n7. Promptly thereafter, the 6\" accused filed C.M.P. No 494 of\n2018 pointing out that though specific allegations are leveled against\nthe petitioner, who is the 4\" accused in the charge, the learned\nSessions Judge had omitted to frame a charge against him. He also\nraised various other contentions touching the merits of his case.\n\n8. The learned Sessions Judge by order dated 5.12.2018\nallowed the petition holding that due to an inadvertent error, charge\nwas omitted to be framed against the petitioner. In tune with the\nobservation made by this Court with regard to incorporation of certain\ndetails concerning the 6\" accused, the learned Sessions Judge\nproceeded to initiate steps to cure the error.\n\n9. The above order is challenged by the petitioner through this\npetition filed under Section 482 of the CrP.C.\n\n10. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner contended\nthat the learned Sessions Judge had erred in acting upon a petition\nfiled by a co-accused to proceed to frame a charge against the\npetitioner. According to the learned counsel, the only alternative\nbefore the learned Sessions Judge was to discharge the petitioner.\n\nBe aeea!\nCr1.MC.No. 8752 of 2018 6 201/KERI962\n\n11. The learned Special Public Prosecutor contended that there\nis no merit in the submissions advanced. She would refer to the final\nreport and it is contended that serious allegations are leveled against\nthe petitioner herein by the victim and it was due to an inadvertent\nerror that the Court below had omitted to frame a charge against him.\nIt is submitted that the trial has not commenced till date and the court\nis armed with powers to correct any error in stating the offence or the\nparticulars required to be stated in the charge. The omission to state\nthe offence or those particulars cannot be regarded at any stage of the\ncase as material, more so when the accused has no case that any\nfailure of justice has occasioned.\n\n12. I have considered the submissions advanced and have\nperused the final report.\n\n13. It appears that the investigation in the instant case was\ncompleted and final report was initially laid against accused Nos.1, 2,\n3,6, 7,8 &9 on 8.1.2019. When the same was laid, the investigation\nagainst the petitioner and two others was being proceeded with. Later,\na final report was laid before the jurisdictional Court as against the\n\nBesse fal\n\nPaley bese\nCr1.MC.No. 8752 of 2018 7 201/KERI962\npetitioner. The first report was returned with a direction to submit it\nalong with the final report against the 4\" accused. As such, final report\nagainst accused Nos. 1 to 9, except the 5 accused was submitted\nbefore court on 19.2.2009. The final report against the 5 accused\nwas thereafter submitted before the learned Magistrate on 6.4.2009.\nThe accused were committed to the Court of Session by a common\ncommittal order dated 14.8.2009. However, when charge was framed\non 15.10.2009, though in the cause title the name of the petitioner is\nalso mentioned, the court below omitted to state the particulars as to\ntime, place and person insofar as the petitioner is concerned. This\nomission was noted only when the 6™ accused brought this fact to the\nnotice of the trial court.\n\n14. The object of framing a charge is to enable the accused to\nhave a clear idea of what he is being tried and for the essential facts\nthat he has to meet. The charge must contain the particulars of date,\ntime, place and person against whom the offence was committed as\nare reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter with\nwhich he is charged. In the instant case, it is evident that it was due\nto an inadvertent error that the charge was omitted to be framed\n\nPastel\n\nBe aeea!\nCr1.MC.No. 8752 of 2018 8 201/KERI962\nagainst the petitioner It is not an error which is not susceptible to\ncorrection. Section 216 of the Code gives ample power to the Courts\nto alter or amend the charge at any time before the Judgment is\npronounced. Even during trial, if the trial court on a broad probabilities\nof the case based upon total effect of the evidence and documents\nproduced is satisfied that any addition or alteration of the charge is\nnecessary, it is free to do so and there cannot be any legal bar to\nappropriately act as the exigencies of the case warrant or necessitate.\nIn the instant case, the trial has not even commenced.\n\n15. In that view of the matter, I find no illegality or irregularity\nin the order passed by the learned Sessions Judge. However, as the\nspecific contention of the petitioner is that he was not granted an\nopportunity to advance his submissions, the learned Sessions Judge\nshall afford the petitioner a pre-charge hearing as provided under\nChapter XVIII of the CrP.C. so that any question of prejudice being\ncaused can be averted.\n\n16. The petitioner shall appear before the court below on\n10.01.2019 and the court shall proceed with the trial in accordance\n\noan\nCr1.MC.No. 8752 of 2018 9 201/KERI962\nwith law. The learned Sessions Judge shall also endeavor to expedite\nthe trial proceedings and take the matter to its logical conclusion as\nmore than a decade has elapsed after registration of the crime.\nThis petition will stand disposed of with the above directions.\nSD/-\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN V.,\n\nJUDGE\n\nIAP //TRUE COPY// P.A.
