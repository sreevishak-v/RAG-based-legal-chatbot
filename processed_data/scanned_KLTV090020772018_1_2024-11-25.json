The Prosecution allegations in brief are as follows: Due to animosity\ntowards the Informant, the Accused persons in furtherance of their common\nintention, on 23.06.2017 at 5.30 PM at Chavadimukku, Sreekaryam ward, uttered\nobscene words to him and punched on his right cheek causing abrasion below his\neyes and further slapped and punched him on various part of his body. Thus, the\nAccused persons are alleged to have committed the above offences.\n3. The cognizance was taken on the basis of Final Report in respect of the\noffences under Sections 294(b), 323 r/w 34 of the IPC. On issuance of process, the\nAccused persons entered appearance. They were enlarged on bail. They were\nrepresented by a Counsel of their own choice. Copies of all relevant Prosecution\nrecords were furnished to them. Particulars of offences under Sections 294(b), 323\nr/w 34 of the IPC were read over and explained to them, to which they pleaded not\nguilty and claimed to be tried.\n\n3\n\n4. From the side of Prosecution CW1 was examined as PW1. Exhibit P1 was\nmarked. The Learned Assistant Public Prosecutor gave up the remaining witnesses\nas the Injured himself had turned hostile to the Prosecution and Prosecution\nevidence was closed. Since no incriminating circumstances arose against the\nAccused persons from the deposition of the witness, their examination under\nSection 313 (1)(b) of the CrPC was dispensed with. No evidence was adduced from\nthe side of the Defence.\n\n5. Heard both sides and perused the documents. The following points arise for\nconsideration.\n\n(a) Have the Accused Persons in furtherance of their common intention\n\nuttered obscene words against PW1 and thereby committed the offence\n\npunishable under section 294(b) r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged\n\n(b) Have the Accused Persons in furtherance of their common intention\n\nvoluntarily caused hurt to PW1 and thereby committed the offence\n\npunishable under section 323 r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged\n\n(c) If so, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded?\n\n6. Points (a) and (b): These points are considered together for the sake of\nbrevity and for avoiding repetition.\n\nPW1 deposed that he resides near Sreekaryam and he is a plumber. He\ndoesn’t remember the exact date of the incident and that the same was in the year\n2018. The incident occurred by around 3.00 pm near Chavadimukku. He further\ndeposed that he had given Exhibit Pl statement to the police regarding the\nincident. There occurred some exachange of words between him and other two\npersons. They uttered obscene words against him. He doesn’t remember whether\nhe went for treatment or otherwise. He would not be able to identify the persons\nwho had allegedly assaulted him. When leading question was put forth by the\nLearned APP under Section 154 of Indian Evidence Act read with Section 162 of\n\n4\nthe CrPC, he admitted that matter has been settled between the parties and there\nis a case pending before this Court in which he is arrayed as the Accused and in\nboth these cases matter has been settled between the parties and Compounding\nPetition filed.\n\nI have carefully considered the evidence adduced by the Prosecution and the\nmaterials on record. It is pertinent to note that PW1, the injured himself is having\nno complaint or allegations that the Accused persons have assaulted him or\nuttered obscene words against him. The remaining witnesses were given up by the\nProsecution as no purpose would be served in examining the remaining witness,\nwhen the Injured herself has no case supporting the Prosecution.\n\nOn perusal of the evidence led by the Prosecution and the materials on\nrecord, it is clear from the testimony of PW1 that there is no evidence to support\nthe Prosecution case. None of the ingredients of the alleged offences are made out\nfrom the evidence led. There is nothing available on record to implicate the\nAccused persons to the above incident. Further, the parties have already settled\nthe matter and filed a Compounding Petition, which however was rejected since\nthe offences alleged involved non-compoundable offence. Hence, on a total\nconsideration of facts and circumstances of the above case and on appreciation of\nthe evidence adduced, this Court finds that the Prosecution has failed to prove the\ncase against the Accused persons and therefore, Points (a) and (b) are found in\nfavour of the Accused persons.\n\n7. In the result, the 1% and 2\"? Accused are found not guilty of having\ncommitted the offences punishable under Sections 294(b), 323 r/w 34 of the Indian\nPenal Code, 1860. They are acquitted of the aforesaid offences under Section\n255(1) of the CrPC. Their bail bonds stand cancelled and they are set at liberty.\n\n(Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her,\ncorrected by me and pronounced in open Court on this, the 25\" day of November,\n2024.)\n\n5\nJudicial Magistrate of First Class -I,\nThiruvananthapuram\nAPPENDIX\nA: Prosecution witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nPW1 Sreekumar(CW1) Eye witness\nexamined on 13-11-2024\nB:Defence witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nC: Court witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA.
