This is a case charge sheeted by the Sub Inspector of Police, Poojappura Police\n\n2\nStation in crime No. 299/2008 against the accused alleging offences\npunishable u/s 323, 324, 354 r/w 34 of IPC.\n\n2. The prosecution case in brief is that the accused due to enmity towards CW1\nwho questioned the act of the accused passing comments on CW2 and in\nfurtherance of their common intention on 28/10/2008 at 9.30 pm, at the public\nroad from Thirumala Junction towards Poojappura, the 1* accused hit CW1\nabove the right eye with an iron pipe which was a dangerous weapon and the\n2™4 accused kicked him down thereby causing injury and hurt to him. When\nCW2 intervened, the 1* accused slapped on her left cheek and on her left arm\nand thereby outraged her modesty. The accused thereby committed the\noffences as alleged against him.\n\n3. Originally the case was taken on file as CC: 116/2009 against the present\naccused. The 2\" accused involved was a Juvenile in conflict with law and the\ncase against him is split up and filed before the Juvenile Justice Board. Since\nthe accused was absconding, the case was entered in LPR as LP: 10/2010.\nWhen the accused was arrested and produced before the court his case was\ntaken out from LPR and refiled as CC: 112/2010. Accused was granted bail in\nthis case. Accused was furnished with copies of all relevant prosecution\nrecords. After hearing, charge for the offences u/s 323, 324, 354 r/w 34 of\nIPC was framed, read over and it was explained to the accused, he pleaded not\nguilty. Thereafter, the case was posted for examination of witnesses. At that\ntime, the accused was again absconded and the case was again entered in LPR\nas LP: 171/2018. When the accused was arrested and produced before the\ncourt his case was taken out from LPR and refiled as CC: 1161/2018. Accused\n\n3\nwas enlarged on bail.\n\n4. To prove their case, the prosecution examined CW1 and CW2 as PW1 and\nPW2 and marked a document as Ext.P1. Since the witnesses examined did\nnot support the prosecution, CW3 to CW9 were given up by the learned APP.\nHence, the prosecution evidence was closed. As there were no incriminating\ncircumstances brought out in evidence against accused, examination u/s 313\nof Cr.P.C was not necessary. The accused did not adduce any evidence.\n\n5. Heard both the sides.\n\n6. The points that arise for consideration are:-\n\n1. Whether the accused had committed the offences punishable u/s 323,\n324, 354 r/w 34 of IPC, as alleged?\n2. What shall be the sentence or order?\n\n7. Point No.1 :- The evidence in this case consists of depositions of 2 witnesses\nand 1 document from the side of the prosecution. PW1 is the defacto\ncomplainant. He affirmed the occurrence on 28/10/2008 in which he was\nattacked by three persons when he questioned them for abusing his wife\n(PW2). He admitted Ext.P1 FI Statement given to police. However, he\ncategorically stated that he could not identify the assailants. PW2 also\ndeposed in similar lines and failed to identify the accused. Both the witness\nstated that the matters were settled and that they had no further grievances.\nThus, all the material witnesses turned hostile to prosecution. Therefore, the\nlearned Assistant Public Prosecutor gave up the remaining witnesses. From\nthe above evidence, there is nothing to prove the occurrence as alleged or to\nconnect the accused with the offences. Thus, the prosecution failed to prove\n\n4\nthat the accused committed the offences u/s 323, 324, 354 r/w 34 of IPC\nPoint No.1 is found against the prosecution.\n\n8. Point No.2 :- In view of my finding on point no.1, the accused is found not\nguilty of the offences punishable u/s 323, 324, 354 r/w 34 of IPC he is\nacquitted u/s 248(1) of Cr.PC and set at liberty, cancelling his bail bond.\nProperty produced in this case as T 533/2008, iron pipe, shall be confiscated.\nDictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected\nand pronounced by me in open Court on this the 28\" day of February 2025.\n\n¢\nElsa Catherine George\nAdditional Chief Judicial Magistrate\n| Kore : / Thiruvananthapuram\n\n3 er \\Z\nBN. vA Sy a\n- 2\n\nSey ;\n\n5\nAPPENDIX\nWitnesses for Prosecution\nPW1 Biju C.S\nPW2 Bindhu C.K\nExhibits for Prosecution\nP1 FI Statement dated 29/10/2008 by PW1\nWitnesses and Exhibits for the defence\nNIL\nMaterial Objects\nNIL\n¢\n32\nElsa Catherine George,\nAdditional Chief Judicial Magistrate,\nThiruvananthapuram.\n| Fessler ON .\nO/ GR NNS\\\nCy a\n\n"
