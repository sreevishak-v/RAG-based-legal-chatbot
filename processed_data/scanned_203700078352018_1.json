CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n07.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nBIR hal\nCrl.MC.No. 7835 of 2018 2 201S1KER/622\nORDER\nUnder challenge in this petition filed under Section 482 of\nthe Cr.P.C. is the order dated 22.03.2018 of the Assistant\nSessions Judge, Neyyattinkara. The learned Sessions Judge by the\nimpugned order, dismissed the petition filed by the petitioners\nherein seeking to arraign one Bhadran as an accused in the course\nof trial under Section 319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (the\n“Code” for short).\n\n2. The petitioners are relatives. The 1* petitioner is the de\nfacto complainant in Crime No.18 of 2003 of the Vellarada Police\nStation. The said crime was registered in connection with an\nincident, which took place on 5.3.2003 at about 4 p.m. The\nprosecution allegation is that accused Nos.1 to 4 in the FIR, in\nfurtherance of their common intention, wrongfully restrained the\nelder brother of the de facto complainant and attacked him with\nweapons. On hearing his cries, the de facto complainant, his wife\nGirija and his brother's wife, Geetha, reached the spot. The\naccused then targeted the de facto complainant and attacked him.\nSome specific overt act is attributed to the aforesaid Bhadran as\n\nsree\nCrl.MC.No. 7835 of 2018 3 201S1KER/622\nwell. When the women intervened, they were attacked and their\nclothes were torn. Based on the information furnished by the i1*\npetitioner, the subject Crime was registered under Sections 341,\n323, 324 and 354 r/w Section 34 of the IPC arraying as many as\nfour persons. Bhadran was the 4\" accused in the crime.\n\n3. On the same day itself, Crime No.17 of 2003 was\nregistered at the instance of one Anil Kumar, arraying the\npetitioners herein as accused, wherein the accusations are under\nSections 341, 323, 324, 308 r/w Section 34 of the IPC.\n\n4. Investigation of both cases was initially conducted by the\nSub Inspector of Police, Vellarada. The 4 accused in Crime No.18\nof 2003 filed a petition before the Superior Police Officer stating\nthat he was innocent and was roped in on frivolous accusations.\nThe District Police Chief entrusted both crimes to the Deputy\nSuperintendent of Police for investigation. Later, the investigation\nwas made over to another officer of the same rank. He conducted\na detailed probe and concluded that the 4\" accused in Crime No.\n18 of 2003 was not involved in the crime. He was removed from\n\nsree\nCrl.MC.No. 7835 of 2018 4 201S1KER/622\nthe array of the accused and final report was laid before the Court\nbelow on 21.10.2005.\n\n5. |The case took more than 12 years to come up for trial.\nThe petitioners were cited as CWs 1 to 4 and on receipt of\nsummons, they appeared before Court and tendered their\nevidence. They spoke about the involvement of the aforesaid\nBhadran as well. After their evidence was over, they filed a\npetition under Section 319 with a prayer to arraign the aforesaid\nBhadran as the 4\" accused.\n\n6. The learned Sessions Judge by a well considered order\ncame to the conclusion that the evidence tendered by the\nwitnesses concerning Bhadran did not inspire confidence and it\nwas further held that the attempt of the petitioners was to ensure\nthat he is arraigned as an accused and nothing else. Their\nevidence was at variance from their earlier statement and were\ncontradictory inter se. Holding so, their application was dismissed.\n\n7. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner\n\nsree\nCrl.MC.No. 7835 of 2018 5 201S1KER/622\ncontended that the aforesaid Bhadran was initially named in the\nFIR and since he is a Government Servant holding a high post, he\nhad wielded his influence and managed to get himself extricated\nfrom the final report. He would further contend that all the\nprosecution witnesses, who were examined, had clearly detailed\nhis role in the incident. He would further point out that though the\nlearned Sessions Judge had left open their right to approach the\ncourt at a later stage, to prevent the same from happening, the\nprosecution has mischievously given up the remaining witnesses.\nThis is a ploy adopted by the prosecution to save the aforesaid\nBhadran, contends the learned counsel.\n\n8. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor, who refuted the\nsubmissions. He contended that a meticulous probe was carried\nout by a superior officer of the Police and he had concluded that\nthe Bhadran was not involved. It is further submitted that the\naforesaid Bhadran is a responsible public servant and the attempt\nof the petitioners is to rope him in. No interference is warranted,\ncontends the learned Public Prosecutor.\n\nsree\nCrl.MC.No. 7835 of 2018 6 201S1KER/622\n\n9. I have considered the submissions advanced and have\nperused the impugned order as well as the materials made\navailable.\n\n10. Power under Section 319 of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure is a discretionary and an extra-ordinary power. It is to\nbe exercised sparingly and only in those cases where the\ncircumstances of the case so warrant. It is not to be exercised\nbecause the Magistrate or the Sessions Judge is of the opinion\nthat some other person may also be guilty of committing that\noffence. Only where strong and cogent evidence occurs against a\nperson from the evidence led before the court that such power\nshould be exercised and not in a casual and cavalier manner. It is\nalso settled that though only a prima facie case is to be\nestablished from the evidence led before the court not necessarily\ntested on the anvil of Cross-Examination, it requires much\nstronger evidence than mere probability of his complicity. The test\nthat has to be applied is one which is more than prima facie case\nas exercised at the time of framing of charge, but short of\nsatisfaction to an extent that the evidence, if goes unrebutted,\n\nsree\nCrl.MC.No. 7835 of 2018 7 201S1KER/622\nwould lead to conviction. In the absence of such satisfaction, the\ncourt should refrain from exercising power under Section 319\nCode of Criminal Procedure (See Hardeep Singh and Ors. v.\nState of Punjab and Ors. 2014 (3) SCC 92).\n\n11. In the case on hand, the learned Assistant Sessions\nJudge had meticulously considered the evidence let in by PWs 1 to\n4 and came to the conclusion that they had gone out of their way\nto prop up their statement to show the involvement of the\naforesaid Bhadran. Their evidence was discrepant in material\nparticulars and was against their earlier version. It was held by\nthe court below that their evidence cannot be relied on to proceed\nagainst the proposed accused. It was also held that the witnesses\nhave given a go by to the earlier statements given before the\ninvestigating officer in order to implicate the proposed accused,\nwho had worked as an Additional Law Secretary. After going\nthrough the evidence of PWs 1 to 4, I am unable to accept the\nsubmission of the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners\nthat the same is cogent and convincing insofar as the person\nsought to be arrayed as the accused is concerned.\n\nPier\npecoreey\neae\na\nCrl.MC.No. 7835 of 2018 8 2019/KERI622\n12. Testing the order passed by the learned Sessions Judge\nin the light of the Constitution Bench judgment of the Apex Court,\nI find that the learned Sessions Judge was well justified in\nrejecting the prayer of the petitioners.\nThis petition will stand dismissed.\nSD/-\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN V.,\nJUDGE\nDSV/-\nTRUE COPY// P.A.
