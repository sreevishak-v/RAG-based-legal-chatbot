    "outcome": "ORDER\nThis is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik\nSuraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail.\n2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable\nunder Sections 409 and 420, r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, and Crime\nCriminal M.C.No.627/2025 1/5\n\nNo. 150/2025 of Aruvikkara Police Station is registered against the petitioner/ 7\"\naccused.\n\n3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- The accused Nos. 1\nto 7, who were the staff of Rajiv Gandhi Residents’ Welfare Co-operative Society\nsituated in Nedumangadu Taluk, along with accused Nos. 8 to 16, in furtherance of\ntheir common intention to obtain wrongful gain and to cause wrongful loss to the\ndepositors in the Society, during the period from 01.04.2021 to 31.05.2024,\ncommitted misappropriation in the deposits, and obtained a total sum of\nRs.24,74,21,480/- from them.\n\n4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The\nInvestigating Officer filed report opposing the anticipatory bail application.\n\n5. Heard. Perused the records.\n\n6. The only point to be considered is, whether an order of anticipatory\nbail can be granted to the petitioner/ 7\" accused.\n\n7. The Point:- The petitioner / 7” accused was an employee of Rajiv\nGandhi Residents’ Welfare Co-operative Society, Mundela. The defacto\ncomplainant was the Part-Time Administrator of Rajiv Gandhi Residents’ Welfare\nCo-operative Society. The prosecution allegation is that, the accused persons have\n\nCriminal M.C.No.627/2025 2/5\n\ncommitted misappropriation of around Rs.24,74,21,480/- by taking loan in benami\nnames and by way of advance MDS. The specific allegation against petitioner / 7\"\naccused is that, she had pledged the property in her name as security for obtaining\ndifferent loans and MDS.\n\n8. The petitioner submits that, she is working as a temporary attender in\nthe Rajiv Gandhi Residents’ Welfare Co-operative Society. It is also submitted\nthat, the 1* accused M.Mohankumar, who was the President of the said Society,\ncommitted suicide, after being falsely accused of misappropriating funds from the\nsaid Society. It is also submitted that, as a temporary attender, the petitioner\ncannot canvass and receive any money from the depositors and she is not a\nsignatory authority in the institution and she has not attained any illegal gain or\nhas not committed any misappropriation of money. She also submitted that, in the\nF.1.S. and in the F.LR., there is no specific allegation against the petitioner / 7\"\naccused.\n\n9. The allegation against the petitioner is not grave. It is seen from the\nreport filed by the Investigating Officer that, when a search was conducted in the\nRajiv Gandhi Residents’ Welfare Co-operative Society, it was found that, using\nthe same property and sureties, the petitioner had availed various loans and chitties\nand obtained more than Rs.50 Lakhs in the names of the husband, mother and\n\nCriminal M.C.No.627/2025 3/5\n\nother relatives of the petitioner/7™ accused. Even if some documents were found\nin the name of the relatives of the petitioner, the relevance of the same in the\nimplication of the crime and the dishonest intention of the petitioner is a matter of\nevidence. The exact role of the petitioner is not brought out by the prosecution. It\nappears that there is no prima facie case against the petitioner. It would be a\ntravesty of justice, if the petitioner is put behind the bars, if she has not committed\nany offence. No criminal antecedents of the petitioner is brought to the notice of\nthis court.\n\n10. In view of my discussion above, it appears that there is no\nimpediment in granting a pre-arrest bail to the petitioner. Considering all these\naspects, it is found that this is a fit case where a pre-arrest bail can be granted to\nthe petitioner.\n\nIn the result, the petition is allowed",
