They are charged for\nhaving committed offence punishable under sections 143,\n147, 148, 341, 324, 326 read with 149 of the IPC.\nRespondents 3 to 5 are the victims.\n\n2.The prosecution allegation is that on 2.8.2012 at 12.15\na.m., the petitioners formed themselves into an unlawful\nassembly and assaulted respondents 2 to 5 with sticks and\nother weapons and caused injuries.\n\n3.Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners,\nrespondents as well as the learned Public Prosecutor.\n\n4.It is submitted that the parties have reached an out of\n\nDsl\n2016/KER/33658\n\nCrl.M.C.3731/2016 2\ncourt settlement and there is no acrimony between them\nat present. All the disputes have been amicably resolved\nand they desire to live in peace and _ harmony.\nRespondents 2, 3, 4 and 5 have sworn to separate\naffidavits wherein they assert that they have no objection\nin terminating the proceedings.\n\n5.The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submits\nthat the petitioners are not persons with criminal\nantecedents.\n\n6.It is thus borne out from the submissions made at the bar\nthat the parties have amicably settled their disputes by\ntheir own free will and without any kind of pressure,\ninfluence or coercion. The compromise, it is felt, is\nvoluntarily and genuine and can be acted upon.\n\n7.In_Gian Singh v. State of Punjab (2012) 10 SCC\n303), Apex Court has held that in appropriate cases, the\nHigh Court can take note of the amicable resolution of\ndisputes between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an\n\nDsl\n2016/KER/33658\n\nCrl.M.C.3731/2016 3\nend to the criminal proceedings. This view was reiterated\nin Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab (2014) 6 SCC\n466) and Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State of\nJharkhand and Another (2014 (9) SCC 653).\n\n8.After having heard the submissions of the learned Counsel\nand on perusing the records, it appears that the offences\nare entirely personal in nature and do not affect public\npeace or tranquility. It is also felt that quashing of\nproceedings on account of compromise would bring about\npeace. In a case such as the instant one, even if the\nprosecution is allowed to continue, it would not serve any\npurpose as the possibility of conviction is remote and\nbleak. It can only result in putting the de _ facto\ncomplainant and the accused to unwanted oppression and\nprejudice. Settlement will augur well for the interest of\nthe community and will enable the parties to live in peace\nand harmony.\nIn the result, this petition is allowed. All further\n\nBGS\n2016/KER/33658\nCrl.M.C.3731/2016 4\nproceedings against the petitioners, who are accused\nNos.1 to 6 in C.C.No.819 of 2013 on the files of the\nJudicial Magistrate of First Class Court-I, Hosdurg shall\nstand quashed",
