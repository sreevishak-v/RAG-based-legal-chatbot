This case arises out of Complaint filed under Section 190(1)(c) of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure (hereinafter referred to as ‘the CrPC’) alleging commission of\noffence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\n(hereinafter referred to as the ‘NI Act’).\n2. The Complainant’s case is as follows: The Complaint and Accused are known to\neach other. The Complainant was a CITU union labourer in Sreekaryam and the\n\n3\n\nAccused was a worker in the Government Ayurveda Panchakarma Hospital. The\nAccused had requested money from the Complainant for his personal affairs, during\nDecember 2015 and accordingly, the Complainant gave him an amount of Rs. 2,00,000/-\n(Rupees Two Lakhs Only) at the Complainant’s home, with an assurance that the same\nwould be repaid to him within three months. The amount when demanded back, the\nAccused, on 01.04.2016, issued a Cheque bearing No. 290511 drawn on his Account No.\n20121023432 maintained with the SBI, Vanchiyoor, at the home of the Complainant. The\ncheque was signed in his presence and other entries were already filled. The\nComplainant presented this Cheque for encashment through his drawee bank, SBT\nSreekaryam and the said Cheque was dishonoured for the reason ‘exceeds\narrangement’ on 30.06.2016. Notice was issued to the Accused on 12.07.2016 and the\nAccused on 15.07.2016 had sent a reply notice denying the knowledge of the\nComplainant as well as the entire transaction. Hence this case.\n\n3. On service of summons, the Accused entered appearance and was enlarged on\nbail. Copies of all relevant documents were furnished to the Accused. Particulars of the\noffence under Section 138 of the NI Act was read over and explained to the Accused and\nhe understood the same. He pleaded not guilty to the offence alleged against him and\nclaimed to be tried.\n\n4. The Complainant examined himself as PW1 and Exhibits P1 to P5 were marked\nfrom his side. A witness was also examined from his side as PW2. Pursuant to closure\nof evidence of the Complainant, the Accused was examined under Section 313(1)(b) of\n\n4\nthe CrPC wherein he denied all the incriminating evidence adduced against him by the\nComplainant. The Accused examined himself as DW1 and Exhibits D1 to D3 were\nmarked from his end.\n5. Heard both sides. The following points arise for consideration: -\n(a) Has the Complainant complied with the statutory requirements under\nSection 138 of the NI Act?\n(b) Has the Accused drawn and issued Exhibit P1 Cheque in favour of the\nComplainant for consideration and in discharge of legally enforceable debt?\n(c) Is the Complainant entitled for the benefit of presumptions under Section\n118 and 139 of the NI Act?\n(d) Has the Accused rebutted the presumptions by adducing probable\nrebuttal evidence?\n(e) Has the Accused committed the offence punishable under Section 138 of\nthe NI Act?\n(f)  Ifso, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded?\n6. Point (a): Exhibit P1 is the Cheque dated 01.04.2016 and the same is seen\npresented for encashment and dishonoured on 30.06.2016 as evident from Exhibit P2\nCheque Dishonour Memo for the reason ‘Exceeds Arrangement.’ Exhibit P3 is the\nLawyer Notice issued on behalf of the Complainant dated 11.07.2016 and Exhibit P4 is\n\n5\n\nthe Postal Receipt in the said regard. Acceptance of notice by the Accused is also noted\nfrom Exhibit P> Acknowledgement Cards. This complaint is seen filed on 12.08.2016\nwhich is within the prescribed statutory period. Hence, this Court finds that the\nComplainant has complied with the statutory requirements as prescribed under the NI\nAct and this point is thus found in favour of the Complainant.\n\n7. Points (b) to (d): These points are considered together for the sake of brevity and\nfor avoidance of repetition.\n\n7.1. The Learned Counsel for the Complainant submits that there is categoric\nadmission of signature in Exhibit P1 Cheque by the Accused and that his only dispute is\nthat the Complainant is a total stranger to the Accused and that he has never had any\ntransaction with the said Complainant. According to him, the Complainant is hand in\nglove with one Viswambharan, the colleague of the Accused, who is alleged to be a\nrelative of the Complainant and to whom the Accused had in fact issued the said blank\nsigned cheque, on account of prior transaction between them; which was misused by\nthe said Viswambharan and the Complaianant by filing up the entries therein. The\nLearned Counsel for the Complainant submits that the Complainant has through her\ncomplaint, affidavit, deposition and documents have categorically established the case\nof Complainant. The signature in Exhibit P1 Cheque is admitted by the Accused, his\nsource of income when challenged by the Accused during his cross-examination, has\nbeen clearly deposed to. The evidence of PW2 also corroborates his case. Despite mere\nsuggestions in the cross-examination of the PWsl and 2, the Accused has neither\n\n6\n\nrebutted the presumption in his favour, nor has adduced any evidence to prove the\nnon-existence of the legally enforceable debt or liability. The Learned Counsel for the\nAccused relies on Priyamavada K v. M Rahufina, 2024(1) KHC 245; Aaramskey Sports\nand Fitness and Another v. Sadanandam P.A. and Another, I.L.R. 2024 (1) Kerala 889;\nRohitbhai Jivanlal Patel v. State of Gujarat & Anr., AIR 2019 SC 1876; _Vijayan R v.\nBaby & Anr; Bir Singh v. Mukesh Kumar, AIR 2019 SC 2446; to buttress his\ncontentions.\n\nPer contra, the Learned Counsel for the Accused submits that the Complainant is\na total stranger to him and that he has never had any transaction between this\nComplainant, much less the present transaction. According to him, he had borrowed an\namount of Rs. 25,000 (Rupees Twenty-Five Thousand Only) from his colleague, a lab\nattender, by name Viswambharan. As a security he had issued the said Exhibit P1\nCheque, which was a blank one signed by him. Similarly, he had also signed on blank\nstamp papers to said Viswambharan. Once he settled the amount by repayment, he\nrequested return of the said Cheque and papers and it was informed that the cheque\nand the papers were missing and Viswambharan assured that under no circumstances\nwould the same be misused by him and the Accused bonafide believed him. The\nComplainant is believed to be a close associate of the said Viswambharan, both of\nwhom colluded and made false entries in the said Cheque and presented the same for\nencashment. The Learned Counsel for the Accused assails the case of the Complainant\non the ground that the transaction and execution of the cheque itself is not proved for\n\n7\n\nthe reasons that (i) the date of alleged lending of money as well as the date of alleged\nissuance of cheque is not seen categorically reflected either in the Complaint or in the\nAffidavit or deposed to by the Complainant; (ii) variation as regards the alleged\nacquaintance of the Complainant with the Accused in his Affidavit and deposition; (iii)\nonus of the Complainant as regards the source of income is not properly discharged,\nespecially with reference to his own deposition as regards his financial condition when\nread in conjunction with deposition of PW2; wherein discrepancies seen reflected as\nregards the amount which PW2 had allegedly owed to PW1 and PW2 had allegedly\nmobilised through chitty transaction as well as the time at which it has been given,\nleading an inference that PW2 is not a credible witness; (iv) there is no vehement and\nspecific denial on part of the Complainant as regards his association with said\nViswambharan, as regards the entries in the Exhibit P1 Cheque. The Learned Counsel\nfor the Accused submits that the Accused has also mounted the box as DW1 and\ndeposed in tune with his case. Thus, the Accused has categorically established his\nprobable defence through the cross-examination of PWs 1 and 2, Exhibits P1 to P3,\nstatement under Section 313(1)(b) of the CrPC and through his own deposition, thereby\nsufficiently discharging the initial onus of proof. To prove his case, he relies on Yahiya P\nv. State of Kerala, 2024 (1) KHC 339; Rahiya v. Jasna 2024 (2) KHC 545; Parameswaran\nv. Sumitha Suresh, 2024 (6) KHC 27.\n\n7.2. The position of law is clear that once the statutory requirements under Section\n138 of the NI Act have been complied with, it is obligatory for the Court to raise the\n\n8\npresumption under Section 139 of the NI Act. Further there is also a presumption under\nSection 118 of the NI Act that the cheque is drawn for a valid consideration. Hence the\nquestion for consideration is whether the Accused has been able to rebut the said\npresumption.\n\nAs regards the alleged transaction between PW1 and the Accused, it is the\nspecific case of the Accused that PWs1 and 2 are total strangers to the Accused, was not\nissued in favour of PW1 towards the alleged transaction between them, rather the same\nwas signed and issued in favour of Viswambharan as security for repayment of Rs.\n25,000/- borrowed by him from the said Viswambharan, who is hand in glove with the\nPW1. PW1 deposed that during 2015, the Accused had requested him amount for his\npersonal affairs and that during January 2016 he had so given the amount of Rs.\n2,00,000/- to the Accused and the same was handed over to him at PW1’s home in the\npresence of his wife, children and PW2 and further that it was under the promise to\nrepay the same within three months that the same was lent to the Accused; and that it is\ntowards repayment of the said amount, that the Accused issued Exhibit P1 Cheque in\nfavour of PW1 at PW1’s home and the entries were already filled except for the\nsignature of the Accused, which according to PW1 was put in his presence. PW1\ndeposed that he doesn’t remember the exact date of issuance of the cheque and further\nthat the amount was given during the beginning of January 2016. According to PW1 it\nis the money that PW2 had owed him on account of prior transactions between them,\nwhich the latter had repaid in instalments to the former during the beginning of\n\n9\n\nJanuary 2016 and he witnessed PW1 giving the amount of Rs. 2,00,000/- to the Accused.\nTo substantiate his case, PW1 examined PW2. PW2, when examined deposed that he\nknew both the parties as they used to visit his shop and that he used to borrow money\nform PW1 at times. According to PW2, when PW1 demanded repayment, an amount of\nRs. 1,50,000/- (Rupees One Lakh Fifty Thousand Only) was repaid by him during the\nbeginning of January, 2016 at the home of PW1 and that the said amount was mobilised\nby him from the Chitty he had subscribed, pursuant to the first year of subscription.\nAccording to PW1, the day on which he had so repaid the said amount, he found the\nAccused at the home of PW1 and PW1 handing over to him the said amount of Rs.\n1,50,000/- and further an amount of Rs. 50,000/- from his possession in cash to the\nAccused.\n\nThe Accused points out that the exact dates as to alleged lending of the said\namount is conspicuously not stated in the Complaint, Affidavit or in the deposition of\nPW1. It is also argued that there is a glaring difference in the Proof Affidavit of PW1\nand his deposition during the cross-examination as to his acquaintance with the\nAccused. In the Proof Affidavit, it is stated that PW1 is having acquaintance with the\nAccused before five years prior to the alleged transaction and in the box, he deposed.\nthat he is having acquaintance with the Accused for about twenty years. Further, during\nhis cross-examination, PW1 deposed of not having bank account at present and used to\nhave the same prior to ten years at Sreekaryam and that ever since he retired from\nservice at the age of 60, he is not having any source of income and his siblings would\n\n10\n\nhelp him financially and that his daughter’s marriage was conducted with the help\nfrom others as well about thirty years back. When specifically put as to how much\namount was given by PW2, PW1 deposed that he does not remember the same exactly\nat present. To the specific question as to the commencement and closure of the alleged\nchit transaction, PW2 deposed that it was completed in the year 2015 and the period of\nchit transaction was for three years. The Accused would contend that, if that be the case,\nthen the same would reveal that the amount was mobilized by PW2 during the year\n2013 and that would go against the version of PWs 1 and 2 that the said amount was\npaid during the beginning of January 2016. PW2 denied the suggestion of the Accused\nthat he had not even seen the Accused and when questioned, he deposed to the\nidentifying features of the Accused as a short person, with dark complexion and\nmedium weight with no baldness and thereafter stated to be person with complexion\nneither dark nor fair. The Learned Counsel would point that the Accused person is\nhaving dark complexion and baldness, and the same itself would reveal the falsity in\ncase of PW2 and that he is not a credible and believable witness.\n\nPertaining to the execution of the Exhibit P1 Cheque, the signature in Exhibit P1\nCheque, though admitted, the same according to the Accused is that which he had\nissued in favour of said Viswambharan. PW1 deposed that the Exhibit P1 Cheque was\nissued in his presence at his home, and the entries except the signature were filled. The\nAccused contends that specific date of alleged issuance of Cheque is not seen reflected\neither in the Complaint or the Proof Affidavit and that specific question were put to\n\n11\nPW1 as regards the same, he deposed that he doesn’t remember the exact date of\nissuance of the Exhibit P1 Cheque and barely denied his association, acquaintance as\nbenami and close relative with the said Viswambaran and also as to who had allegedly\nfilled the entries in Exhibit P1 Cheque. The Accused as DW1 mounted the box and gave\nevidence in tune with his defence and said details were already intimated to the PW1\nvide Exhibit D1 Reply Notice.\n\nThe Learned Counsel for the Accused strongly argued in light of decisions that\nhe relied on stated supra that as regards the standard of proof in rebutting the\npresumption is only preponderance of the probability and that the discrepancies\ninferred and pointed put as elicited through the cross-examination of PWs 1 and 2, his\nstatement given in examination under Section 313(1)(b) CrPC, Exhibits D1 to D3 and his\ndeposition would make his defence so probable that he had discharged his onus as to\nrebuttal of the presumption that has arisen in favour of PW1 by pointing out existence\nof suspicious circumstances as elucidated above. Thus, according to the Accused, the\ntransaction itself is not proved for the said reasons and there is no legally enforceable\ndebt that exist in favour of the PW1. So is the case with Exhibit P1 Cheque. He further\nargues that the decisions relied on by PW1 cannot come to his aid in the present case, as\nalthough the signature in Exhibit P1 Cheque is admitted, the specific case is that it has\nnot been issued in favour of PW1, but in favour of another person and PW1 is not the\npayee in the present case.\n\n12\n\nThe Learned Counsel for the Complainant at this juncture drew the attention of\nthis Court to the deposition of DW1. In the examination-in-Chief, DW1 deposes in tune\nwith his defence. He deposed that he had given blank signed Cheque drawn in favour\nof said Viswambharan on his account maintained with SBT and the said Cheque on\nrepayment was not given back to him and it was only when Exhibit P1 notice was\nreceived by him that he was aware of the same that Exhibit Pl Cheque had been\nmisused by said Viswambharan in collusion with the PW1. He was shown Exhibit P1\nCheque and he identified his signature and denied the entries made therein. During his\ncross-examination, he denied knowledge of PW1 and admitted to have bank account in\nSBI Vanchiyoor Branch, which is the only existing account in his name. He even\ndeposed the address of said Viswambharan and stated that he had borrowed the\namount only from him and admitted his sign in Exhibit P1 Cheque. He further deposed\nthat he had issued said Exhibit P1 Cheque and also stamp papers filled with his address\nand amount borrowed to the said Viswambharan. He deposed that he does not exactly\nremember the date of repayment to said Viswambharan and that it was repaid in cash\nat his home and that Exhibit P1 is the evidence for the said transaction according to him.\nOn specific questions as to demanding the Cheque back from said person, DW1\ndeposed that though he asked, the same was not returned and that they both went to\neach other’s house even thereafter; however, he never went to Viswambaran’s house\ndemanding return of the Cheque and the same was demanded through phone alone as\nthe said Viswambharan was laid up pursuant to surgery related to heart. Further,\nspecific question was put to DW1 as to whether he demanded the Cheque back from\n\n13\n\nViswambharan when pursuant to receipt of Exhibit P1 Lawyer notice, to which he\nanswered in the affirmative with addition that the latter’s wife had requested not to\ndisturb her husband since he is laid up. Further DW1 categorically denied having\npreferred any complaint to the authorities concerned as regards the said Cheques\nhaving been so misappropriated by PW1 and the said Viswambharan as alleged. The\nLearned Counsel for the Complaiant points out that the Accused has not been able to\nproperly discharge his burden to rebut the presumption for the reasons that (i) he\nadmits the signature in Exhibit P1 Cheque, (ii) he has not deposed as to either the year\nduring which the alleged transaction and repayment made to the said Viswabharan,\nexcept the amount (iii) he knows the details of said Viswambharan as seen reflected\nfrom Exhibit D1 Reply Notice, yet refrained from examining him to prove his case and\n(iv) he has not even approached the concerned authorities by raising grievance as to the\nalleged misappropriation of his Cheque. All these would point to the boanfides of the\ncase put forth by the Petitioner and cuts to the root of the same, especially when the\nPW1 has denied acquaintance with said Viswambharan or that he is his relative. The\nLearned Counsel for PW1 submits that the Accused has not been able to raise a\nprobable defence as to rebut the presumption in his favour in light of principles laid\ndown in the rulings relied on by him cited supra.\n\n7.3. Ihave carefully considered the materials on record and the submissions put forth\nby the Learned Counsel for the Complainant and the Accused. It is well settled that lack\nof averments regarding the details of the transaction is not fatal to the case of the\n\n14\nComplainant. In fact, there is specific averment as to the alleged amount having been\ngiven to the Accused in the Complaint, Affidavit as well as in the deposition.\nAdmittedly, the exact dates of payment of Rs. 2,00,000/- and the issuance of the Cheque\nthough not stated the month and the year during which the same has occurred is\ncategorically deposed to by PW1 and the same is substantiated by the evidence of PW2.\nThe contention of Learned Counsel for the Accused that the alleged dates have not been\nstated is therefore not fatal to the case of the Complainant and hence the same is\ndispelled. The same goes with the contention of the Accused as regards the discrepancy\nin the acquaintance of the PW1 with DW1. It is true that there is a difference in the\nnumber of years of acquaintance stated by PW1, however, the same cannot be held to be\nso material in the present circumstance of the case so as to shake the evidence of the\nComplaint. Furthermore, PW1 was aged 73 years as on the date of his examination. As\nregards the proof of the transaction, issuance of the Exhibit P1 Cheque and the source of\nfunds; it is true that PW1 deposed to the effect that he is not having any source of\nincome since his retirement, but the fact that the amount which he had given to DW1 is\nthat which PW2 allegedly owed to him and which according to PW2, he had repaid by\nmobilising funds from his chit transaction and having seen the remaining amount to\nhave been paid by PW1 from his possession leaves the question of source of PW1 to\nhave been answered categorically. The discrepancy pointed out by the Accused in the\nalleged amount repaid by PW2 to PW1 in instalments and PW1 not remembering the\nexact amount repaid by PW1 to him and that the deposition of PW2 that he came to\nknow that the remaining amount paid by PW1 from his possession was Rs. 50,000/- as\n\n15\n\ninformed by PW1 are also not so material so as to affect the essence of the case of PW1,\non consideration of the totality of the evidence. Further the contention that if the\ndeposition of PW2 to the effect that the chit transaction was completed in the year 2015\nand the period of chit transaction was for three years was taken to be true, then the\nsame would reveal that the amount was mobilized by PW2 during the year 2013 and\nthat would go against the version of PWs 1 and 2 that the said amount was paid during\nthe beginning of January 2016, cannot also be accepted. The reason being that, there is\nno case either for PW1 or PW2 that the said amount was repaid on the same day or at\nthe same time when he got the same after one year pursuant to his subscribing to the\nsame. This Court does not find force in the contention of the Accused that there is no\ncategoric denial by PW1 as regards his acquaintance and association with said\nViswambharan, them colluding to have made false entries in the Exhibit P1 Cheque and.\nas regards the person who has filled the details therein. This is so, for the reason that, at\nthe first instance itself when a specific question was put as regards his acquaintance\nwith said Viswambharan, PW1 had categorically denied the same stating that he neither\nknow the said person, nor is the said person his relative or associate. The questions\nwere repeatedly put to him to which he denied with answers he doesn’t know. This\nCourt is of the view that those denials cannot be read in isolation and the same has to be\nconsidered in toto and when so considered, this Court does not find any inconsistency\nin the subsequent answers of the PW1 as there is no reason why a person would answer\notherwise pertaining to question regarding a person whom he already categorically\ndenied to have known or had any acquaintance thereto.\n\n16\n\nThis Court finds force in the contention of the Learned Counsel for the\nComplainant that the Accused has not been able to properly discharge his burden of\nrebutting the presumption in favour of the Complainant. Although in the present case,\nthe Accused raised a plea of probable defence that the Exhibit P1 Cheque has been\nissued by him in favour of Viswambharan on account of the transaction he had with\nhim, the Accused has failed to substantiate the same by leading cogent evidence in\nsupport of the said plea. It is settled that it is not only sufficient that the Accused has to\nraise plea of probable defence. He shall also lead cogent, reliable and trustworthy\nevidence in support of the said plea. This can, of course be either directly or through\ncross-examination of the Complainant, materials relied on by him as well and the\nstandard of proof is only preponderance of probability. However, in the present case,\nthe evidence led by the Accused would reveal that there is no whisper as to the period\nof alleged transaction between the said Viswambharan, the period of repayment, that\nthe Complainant was in fact a close confidante, associate, relative or benami of the said\nperson especially taking into account that PW1 categorically denied any acquaintance\nwith the said person. The sign in Exhibit P1 Cheque is admitted by the Accused. It is\npertinent to note that despite having known that the said Cheque is so allegedly\nmisused by the PW1 and Viswambharan, no steps taken by the Accused to prosecute\nthem as regards the alleged misuse before any authorities concerned.\n\nIt is true that the rebuttal need not be conclusively established, but such evidence\nmust be adduced before the Court in support of the defence that the Court must either\n\n17\n\nbelieve it to exist or consider its existence to be reasonably probable, the standard of\nreasonability being that of a prudent man. (See Rahiya v. Jasna 2024 (2) KHC 545). The\nonly reason stated herein is that Viswambharan’s wife had in fact intimated the\nAccused not to disturb him as he was laid up, which in fact is beyond prudence and\nreasonableness. The Court has to consider and appreciate the totality of evidence to\narrive at a conclusion that the case of the Complainant is shaken for the reason of\nAccused having established a probable defence. (See Tedhi Singh v. Narayan Dass\nMahant, 2022 (6) SCC 735). The points raised by the Learned Counsel for the Accused\nas to have been elicited from the Cross-Examination of PWs 1 and 2 has to be read in\nconjunction with the evidence led by him in support of his plea and when so read, the\nsame, in view of this Court, would only lead to the inevitable conclusion that the\nAccused has not been able to properly substantiate his plea of probable defence.\n\nThus, on an overall consideration of the materials placed on record and\nsubmissions of the Learned Counsel for the Complainant and the Accused, this Court is\nof the view that the Accused has not rebutted the presumption in favour of the\nComplainant by raising probable defence. There is no cogent evidence to show that the\nExhibit P1 Cheque was not issued in discharge of legally enforceable debt. The Accused\nhas failed to discharge his onus to rebut the presumption under 5.139 that the cheque\nhas been issued in discharge of a debt or liability. Hence, these points are found in\nfavour of the Complainant.\n\n18\n\n8. Points (e) & (f): —_—‘In light of the above, the Accused is found guilty of having\ncommitted the offence punishable under Section 138 of the NI Act and is therefore\nconvicted for the said offence under Section 255(1) of the CrPC.\n\nThe Convict is sentenced to pay fine of Rs. 3,53,000/- (Rupees Three Lakhs Fifty\nThree Thousand Only), that is; Rs. 2,00,000 (Rupees Two Lakhs Only) being the amount\nof Exhibit P1 Cheque, together with an amount of Rs. 1,53,000 (Rupees One Lakh Fifty-\nThree Thousand Only), being the interest for the Cheque Amount at the rate of 9% p.a.\nfrom the date of dishonour, i.e., 30.06.2016 till this day, i.e.; 30.12.2024.
