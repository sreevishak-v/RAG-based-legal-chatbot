It is submitted\nthat final report has already been filed.\n\n4. The proceedings are sought to be quashed on\ndifferent grounds. The first is that no offence is made out.\nThough the trial court has already framed the charge it is\n\nDy\noe\nets ‘a\n2015/KER/1050\nCrl.M.C.No.3485 of 2013\n-2-\nnot challenged in this proceedings.\n\n5. It is stated in the petition that the matter has\nbeen settled between the parties. This is opposed by the\nsecond respondent, who is the victim in the case. More\nover, the offence is non-compoundable. The court cannot\ntake notice of the agreement between the parties.\n\n6. Thus, in any view of the matter, this is not a fit\ncase to favour the petitioner with an order under Section\n482 Cr.P.C.\n\nIn the result, this Crl.M.C. is dismissed.\n\nSd/-\nK.
