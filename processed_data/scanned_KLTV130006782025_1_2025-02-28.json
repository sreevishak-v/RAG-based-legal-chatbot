Hence filed this petition.\n\n4. A report was called for from Station House Officer, Thumba Police Station. The\nStation House Officer filed a report stating objection that the vehicle was used by\n\n2\nthe third accused to travel to the place of occurrence.\n\n5. Heard both sides .The following question has arisen for consideration:-\n\nIs the petitioner entitled to the interim custody of motorcycle bearing\nregistration No. KL-22-Q-1268 which is produced as T No. 63/2025 ?\n\n6. The point :- Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that petitioner is the original\nregistered owner. Now the vehicle was recovered by the police and is kept in the\npremises of the Police Station. If the vehicle is kept in the premises of police station for\na long period which will result in the deterioration of the value of vehicle and thereby\ncause irreparable injury to the petitioner. Petitioner is ready to abide by any condition\nimposed by the court for the release of the said vehicle to the interim custody of him.\n\n7. The learned Assistant Publice Prosecutor objected the application and submitted, that\nthe vehicle is required for investigation.\n\n8. On perusal of records of prosecution and original documents of the vehicle produced by\nthe petitioner it can be seen that, the petitioner is the registered owner of the vehicle.\n\n9. In Sunderbhai Ambalal Desai v.State of Gujarat AIR 2003 SC638 it was held that, In\nour view, the powers under S.451, Cr.P.C. should be exercised expeditiously and\njudiciously. It would serve various purposes, namely: -\n\n1. Owner of the article would not suffer because of its remaining unused or\n\nby its misappropriation;\n\n2. Court or the police would not be required to keep the article in safe\n\ncustody;\n\n3. If the proper punchnama before handing over possession of an article is\n\nprepared, that can be used in evidence instead of its production before the Court\n\nduring the trial. If necessary, evidence could also be recorded describing the\n\nnature of the property in detail; and\n\n4, This jurisdiction of the Court to record evidence should be exercised\n\npromptly so that there may not be further chance of tampering with the articles.\n10. Ihave heard the contentions of both parties and perused the materials placed\n\n3\n\nbefore me by the prosecution. As per the report the vehicle was used by the third\naccused to reach at the place of occurence. There is no investigation pertaining to the\nvehicle is going on. No investigation has to be done in connection with the vehicle . In\nthe light of judgment of the Honourable Apex Court this court is of the view that,\ninterim custody of the motorcycle bearing registration number KL-22-Q-1268 can be\ngranted to the petitioner on conditions. Hence this court is inclined to allow this\npetition.\n\nAs a result, petition is allowed on following conditions:-\n\n1.
