He deposed against the case of\nthe Prosecution.\n\nPW2 deposed that he sustained injuries in the incident and that the since\ndeceased is his friend. The incident occurred to him at Sasthamangalam in front of\nKPCC office. Though he deposed that he doesn’t remember having given the\nstatement to the police; he identified his signature in Exhibit P1.

The incident occurred during 2013-14 and he doesn’t remember the exact\ndate. It was around 10:00 PM in between Vellayambalam and Sasthamangalam. He\ndeposed that he was on his two-wheeler and found people gathered there and saw\na bike involved in an accident; but not the person who sustained injury. He denied\nhaving given statement to the police and deposed that his address was given to the\npolice. He categorically denied having given statements to the police with respect\nto having witnessed the incident; the identity of the car, injured and the driver; the\nreason for the incident; when the Learned APP drew his attention to those\nstatements by putting specific questions. He further deposed to have seen a car as\n\n5\nwell. During the cross-examination, he deposed that he did not witness the alleged\nincident and he reached only pursuant to fifteen minutes of the alleged accident.\n\nPW6 deposed that on the basis of the intimation received from Medical\nCollege, he went there on 05.06.2013 and recorded Exhibit P1 FIS and registered\nExhibit P8 FIR thereafter.

He had visited the place of occurrence, inspected the same and\nprepared Exhibit P12 Scene Mahazar.\n\nThis Court has carefully gone through the materials on record and\nconsidered the submissions of the respective parties. On going through the\nevidence on the record, it can be seen that PW1, the occurrence witness deposed\nagainst the version of the Prosecution. PW5, the other occurrence witness has no\nconsistent case and he also deposed against the version of the Prosecution.\nFurther, the contradictions in the deposition of the PW5 is not proved as and the\nsame have not been put to the Investigating Officer. Though PW2, admits of\nhaving sustained injury, he has no case that it was the Accused who had allegedly\nhit his vehicle on theirs. The remaining witnesses were given up by the Learned\nAssistant Public Prosecutor. There is nothing on record as revealed from the\ndeposition of the witnesses so as to implicate the Accused to the alleged incident\nthat the Accused had driven his car in a rash and negligent manner, at high-speed\ncausing the injured to succumb to his injuries. Nothing has been brought out in\nevidence to the effect to prove the ingredients of the offences alleged. The\nProsecution has failed to substantiate its case by adducing proper evidence and\nthereby failed to prove the guilt of the Accused beyond reasonable doubt. Hence\nPoints (a) to (c) are found in favour of the Accused.\n\n7. Point d: In light of analysis of the points hereinabove, since those are found\nin favour of the Accused, no sentence is to be awarded to the Accused.\n\n8. In the result, the Accused is found not guilty of having committed the\noffence punishable under Sections 279, 337, 304 A of the IPC. Hence, the Accused\n\n6\nis acquitted of the said offences under section 255(1) of CrPC. His bail bond stands\ncanceled and he is set at liberty.\n(Dictated to my Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected by\nme and pronounced in open court on this the 10* day of February, 2025)\nJudicial Magistrate of First Class-I\nThiruvananthapuram\nAPPENDIX\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA: Prosecution witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nPW1 Vinod(CW3) examined on | Occurrence witness\n30.08.2019\nPW2 Amal (CW1) examined on | Occurrence witness\n24.12.2019\nPW3 G Madhavadas(CW5) Occurrence witness\nexamined on 16.12.2021\nPW4 C Sreekumaran Police Witness\nNair(CW17) examined on\n03.07.2024\nPW5 Santhosh Kumar.
