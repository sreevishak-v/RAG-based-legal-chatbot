M.C No. 6266 of 2013\nDated this the 01* day of January, 2014.\nORDER\n\nPetitioners are the accused Nos. 1 and 3 in O.R. No.\n9/98 of Nelliampathy Forest Range. The offences alleged are\npunishable under Sections 27(1)(e)(iii) and (iv) of Kerala\nForest Act. The Crl.M.C is filed seeking to quash charge sheet\nand all further proceedings in C.C No. 852/2005 now pending\nas LPR No. 1/2010 on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate\nCourt, Alathur.\n\n2. There are 8 accused in the crime. All accused\nexcept accused Nos. 1, 3 & 8 faced trial and they were\nacquitted by the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Alathur.\nAnnexure-B is the copy of the judgment dated 08/12/2005 in\nC.C No. 695/01.\n\n3. The accused No. 5 confessed in P3 statement that\nfour persons along with him had committed the offence of\ntress-pass and felling of trees along with accused Nos. 2 and 3.\nAfter referring to Annexure-P2 mahazar and P3 confession\nstatement, the learned Magistrate found that the\ndiscrepancies in the extract of confession contained in P3 and\nP4 confession given by A5 are not explained by PW2. It was\n\npe ee\n\n2014/KER/59\nCri. M.C No. 6266 of 2013 ;\nalso observed that there are no independent attestors to the\nstatement purportedly recorded by PW2. The learned\nMagistrate concluded that P3 statement cannot be relied\nupon without corroboration from other sources and that the\ndiscrepancies discussed above appearing in P3 and P4 remains\nunexplained. In the circumstances, the court found that\ncomplainant has not succeeded in proving the offences against\nthe accused. The learned Magistrate found that accused\nNos.A2, A4 to A7 are not guilty of having committed the\noffence.\n\n4. The case against the remaining accused was split\nup and refiled as C.C No. 852/05 and is now pending as LPR\nNo. 01/2010. It is submitted that in the light of the acquittal\nof the co-accused there is no scope for proceeding against the\nremaining accused since the prosecution has mainly relied\nupon the confession statement of the fifth accused and that\nthe court below has disbelieved the confession made by the\nfifth accused. Since the other accused were acquitted, for the\nvery same set of reasons, this Court is of the view that no\npurpose would be served by continuing the prosecution\nagainst the petitioner.\n\n2014/KER/59\n\nCrl. M.C No. 6266 of 2013 3\n\nAccordingly, Crl.M.C is disposed of quashing\nAnnexure-A charge sheet and all further proceedings in C.C\nNo. 852/2005 now pending as LPR No. 1/2010 on the file of\nJudicial First Class Magistrate Court, Alathur.\n\nHARUN-UL-RASHID, JUDGE.\n\nIsn\n\n"
