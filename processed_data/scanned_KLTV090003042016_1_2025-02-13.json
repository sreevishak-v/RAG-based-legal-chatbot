This is a case instituted upon the Final report filed by Sub Inspector of\nPolice, Sreekaryam Police Station in Crime No. 1367 of 2013 for the offences\npunishable under Section 394 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred\nto as the ‘IPC’).\n2. The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: : On 19.11.2013 at 9.30 PM\nat Cheruvakkal village, Chithravila Road, the Accused persons in furtherance of\ntheir common intention, wrongfully restrained the Informant and CW2. The 2™\nAccused pushed CW2 by having caught hold of his neck and the 3™ Accused\nslapped on his left cheek. The 4\" Accused kicked on the abdomen of CW2 who had\nfallen down and the 1* Accused forcibly took away an amount of Rs. 500/- and\nNokia Mobile from CW2’s pockets. The Informant who attempted to resist them\nwas physically assaulted by the Accused persons and criminally intimidated by\nthem with an injury to his person, if he attempts to lodge a complaint with the\n\n3\n\npolice. Thereby the Accused persons are alleged to have committed the above-\nmentioned offence.\n3. This Court took cognizance in respect of offences under Sections 394 of the\nIPC, on the basis of the Final Report. On issuance of process, the Accused Persons\nentered appearance. They were enlarged on bail and were represented by a\nCounsel of their own choice. Copies of all relevant Prosecution records were\nfurnished to them. Pursuant to hearing both the sides on question of framing\ncharge, the charge was framed for the aforesaid offence. The charge was read over\nand explained to them, to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.\n4. From the side of Prosecution, CWs6 and 7 were examined as PW 1 and PW2\nrespectively. Exhibits P1 to P7 and MO1 were also marked. The presence of CW1\nto 4 could not be procured by the Prosecution and report filed to that effect by the\nProsecution that their presence cannot be procured in the near future. CW5 was\nreported to be in abroad. Accused was examined under Section 313(1)(b) of the\nCrPC wherein he denied all the incriminating circumstance adduced against him\nby the Prosecution. No Defence evidence was adduced by the Accused.\n5. Heard both sides and perused relevant documents. The following points\narise for consideration.\n\na. Have the Accused Persons voluntarily caused hurt to CWs 1 and 2 in\n\ncommitting robbery as alleged and thereby committed offence punishable\n\nunder section 394 of IPC?\n\nb. If so, the proper sentence to be awarded?\n6. Point (a): PW1 deposed that he was the Station House Officer,\nSreekaryam at the relevant period of time. He deposed that Exhibit P1 FIS was\nrecorded by him on the basis of information given by the Informant to the effect\nthat the latter was a foreman in charge of construction work near Sreekaryam and\nthat while he was on his way back along with CW2, they were wrongfully\nrestrained by around four persons, assaulted them and robbed the mobile phone\n\nA\nand Rs. 500/- from the pocket of CW2. On the basis of the same, he registered\nExhibit P2 FIR.\n\nPW2, the Investigating Officer deposed that he prepared Exhibit P3 Scene\nMahazar after visiting the place of occurrence. He deposed that he had effected\nthe arrest of the Accused persons and Exhibit P4 series and Exhibit P5 Series, that\nis, the Arrest and Inspection Memos respectively were prepared by him. Exhibit P6\nis the Address Report and he deposed that the Nokia Mobile Phone and Rs. 500/-\nwas recovered from the Accused person and the same was produced before this\nCourt by incorporating the same in Exhibit P7 KPF 151A Form. He further deposed\nthat he can very well identify the said phone so recovered and identified M.O. 1\nbefore the Court. He also deposed that he is able to identify the Accused persons\nwho have committed the aforesaid offences and identified them.\n\nThe Learned Counsel for the Accused submits that neither the alleged\ninjured witnesses nor the occurrence witnesses have turned up before this Court to\nprove the case of the Prosecution. Despite the deposition of PW2 that MO1 and the\ncurrency note was allegedly recovered from the 1* Accused, there is no evidence\nput forth to the effect that it was in fact the same phone or cash alleged to have\nbeen robbed by them from CW2. Nor has the same been identified by the witness\neither before the Court or otherwise.\n\nThis Court has carefully gone through the materials on record and also the\nsubmissions of the Learned Counsel for the Accused and the Learned APP. On\ngoing through the evidence and the materials on record, it is pertinent to note that\nneither the injured nor the occurrence witnesses have mounted the box to prove\nthe Prosecution case. The Prosecution failed to secure their presence. Merely upon\nthe deposition of PW2 that MO1 was recovered from the 1* Accused and the same\nwere identified by the witnesses, there cannot be conviction of the Accused\npersons for the aforesaid offence. There is no identification of MO.1 by the injured\nwitnesses before the Court. The fact of alleged assaults, restraint, intimidation\nhave not been brought forth in evidence. In fact, there is nothing before this Court\nto implicate the Accused persons to the alleged incident. The alleged incident itself\n\n5\nis not proved. There is no proof at all of the Prosecution case, much less a proof\nbeyond reasonable doubt. The Prosecution has failed to establish the ingredients\nof the alleged offence and the involvement of the Accused persons in the same.\nHence these points are found in favour of the Accused.\n7. Point (a): In light of the finding above, question of sentencing the Accused\ndoes not arise.\n8. In the result, the Accused persons are found not guilty of having committed\nthe offence punishable under Sections 394 of the IPC and are acquitted thereof\nunder Section 248(1) of CrPC. Their bail bonds stand canceled and they are set at\nliberty.\n\nThe M.O.1 and the currency Note entered in Property Register of this Court\nas T. No. 264/2013 shall be disposed of subject to the Rules, pursuant to the lapse\nof period of Appeal. In case any Appeal is preferred, the disposal shall be pursuant\nto the finality of the Appeal thereof.\n\n(Dictated to my Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected by\n\nme and pronounced in open court on this the 13\" day of February, 2025)\n\nJudicial Magistrate of First Class-I\nThiruvananthapuram\nAPPENDIX\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\n\nA: Prosecution witness\n\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\n\n6\n1 Jayakumar(CW6) examined|Official Witness\non 04.01.2025\n2 Rajesh Kumar V(CW7) Official Witness\nexamined on 28.01.2025\n\nB: Defence witness\n\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\n\nNil Nil Nil\n\nC: Court witness\n\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\n\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA.
