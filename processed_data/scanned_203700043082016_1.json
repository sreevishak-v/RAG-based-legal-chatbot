TO JUDGE\n\n2017/KER/49546\nP.UBAID, J.\nDated this the 7\" day of December 2017\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner seeks orders quashing the proceedings in\nCR 72/2016 of the Excise Range, Thiruvananthapuram. Due to\nthe stay granted by this Court, investigation stands stalled. The\npetitioner's grievance is that the respondent has unnecessarily\nregistered a crime under Section 55(i) of the Kerala Abkari Act\n(for short, ‘the Act'), and if at all the facts are admitted, it is at\nthe best only a violation of the licence conditions, punishable\nonly under Section 56(b) of the Act.\n\n2. The prosecution case is that some quantity of Indian\nMade Foreign Liquor was seen kept at the premises of the\npetitioner for illicit sale. Let the Investigating Officer make a\nthorough investigation, and conclude what exactly is the offence\ninvolved. Let it be thoroughly examined and concluded whether\nthis is only a case of innocent possession of Indian Made Foreign\nLiquor within permitted limits, or whether there are materials\nto substantiate the allegations under Section 55(i) of the Act.\nAny way, let the investigation progress, and let a final report be\n\nae\nBiseanee\n2017/KER/49546\nCrl.M.C. No.4308 of 2016\n“1 2i-\nfiled by the Excise Inspector. If the petitioner is in any manner\naggrieved by the final report, he can pursue appropriate\nremedies under the law.\n\nThus, giving liberty to the petitioner to challenge the\nfinal report appropriately, in case it goes against him, or to his\nprejudice, or if he is so advised, this Crl.M.C. is disposed of. In\nthe interest of justice, I direct the Investigating Officer to submit\nfinal report within three months, if possible.\n\nSd/-\nP.UBAID\nJUDGE\n/[TRUE COPY//\nP.A. TO JUDGE\nJvt/7.12.2017\n\n"
