According to the petitioner, the registration of the crime\nas Annexure-A4 amounts to double jeopardy since Crime\nNo.91/2022 has already been registered before the\nPantheerankavu Police Station.\n\n3. On a perusal of Annexure A4 FIR as well as the FIR in\nCrime No.91/2022, I am of the prima facie view that both\ncrimes arise out of different causes of action and therefore the\nconcept of double jeopardy cannot apply. Even otherwise, the\nconcept has no application at the stage of investigation as well.\n\n4. Apart from the above, since Annexure-A4 FIR was\nregistered on 05-09-2023 and the investigation has only\ncommenced, it is not be proper on the part of this Court to\ntrench upon the investigating powers of the Police.\n\nPearl\naa\n2024/KER/2008\nCRL.MC NO. 113 OF 2024\n3\n5. Therefore, reserving the liberty of the petitioner to\ninitiate appropriate proceedings in accordance with law after the\nfinal report is filed, this Crl.M.C is dismissed.\nSd/-\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\nAJM\n\nDre\neae\n2024/KER/2008\nCRL.MC NO. 113 OF 2024\n4\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 113/2024\n\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES\n\nAnnexure At A TRUE COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT FILED\nBY SHO, PANTHEERANKAVU POLICE STATION\nDATED 28/01/2023 BEFORE THE JFCM -\nIII, KOZHIKODE\n\nAnnexure A2 A TRUE COPY OF THE WITNESS SCHEDULE IN\nCC 84/2023 PENDING BEFORE THE JFCM -\nIII, KOZHIKODE DATED 13/01/2023\n\nAnnexure A3 A TRUE COPY OF THE STATEMENT GIVEN BY\nTHE 3RD RESPONDENT IN CRIME NO.\n91/2022 OF PANTHEERANKAVU POLICE\nSTATION DATED 19/02/2022 WHICH IS PART\nOF ANNEXURE Al FINAL REPORT\n\nAnnexure A4 A TRUE COPY OF THE FIR IN CRIME NO.\n988/2023 OF NILAMBUR POLICE STATION\nDATED 5/09/2023\n\nAnnexure A5 A TRUE COPY OF INTERIM ORDER DATED\n18/12/2023 IN BAIL APPLICATION\nNO.7998/2023 WITH RESPECT TO CRIME NO.\n9988/2023 OF NILAMBUR POLICE STATION\n\n"
