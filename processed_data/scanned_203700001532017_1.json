The prosecution alleged that, the accused\nherein, drove his vehicle in a rash and negligent manner on\n15.10.2014 at 10.a.m., in such a manner as to endanger the life\nof the people, hit against a person, who was thrown off, had\nallegedly sustained injuries and later succumbed. After\ninvestigation, final report was laid.\n2. Contending that his vehicle had not sustained any\ndamage, that his vehicle had not hit the victim and that he has\nbeen falsely implicated, the petitioner has sought to quash the\nentire proceedings.\n3. Heard learned counsel for the petitioner and the\nlearned Public Prosecutor.\n3. The prosecution is essentially relying on the\n\nPetetae\nops\n2017/KER/947\nCrl.M.C.No. 153 of 2017 2\npostmortem report which indicates that the victim died due to the\ninjury sustained to his head. Eye witnesses have been arrayed to\nsubstantiate the allegation that, they have seen the incident and\nthat the vehicle was driven by the petitioner herein in a rash and\nnegligent manner. Hence, it is clear that the question whether he\nwas driving the vehicle, whether it was rashly and negligently\ndriven and that he had caused the death of the person are all\nmatters which are in the realms of appreciation of evidence. I do\nnot feel that this is a matter which can be challenged in a\nproceeding under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\nThe Crl.M.C. fails and is dismissed accordingly.\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS , JUDGE.\nrmm/11/1/2017\n// True Copy //\nP.A.
