The court below as per Annexure-A3\norder dated 12.12.2018 ordered to suspend\nthe execution of sentence. The court below\nas per Annexure-A3 order inter alia directed\nthe petitioner to deposit Rs.1 lakh before\nthe trial court at the time of executing the\n\n2019/KER/170\nCri.MC.No. 8950 of 2018\n-3-\nbond. Aggrieved by the said direction, this\nCrl1.M.C. has been filed.\n\n2. Heard.\n\n3. The trial court sentenced the\npetitioner to simple imprisonment for one\nyear and a fine of Rs.10 lakh under Section\n138 of the N.I.Act. Section 148 of the\nN.I.Act provides that notwithstanding\nanything contained in the Code of Criminal\nProcedure, 1973, in an appeal by the drawer\nagainst conviction under Section 138, the\nAppellate Court may order the appellant to\ndeposit such sum which shall be minimum of\ntwenty per cent of the fine or compensation\nawarded by the trial court. In this case,\nthe court below directed only to deposit\n\n2019/KER/170\nCrl.MC.No. 8950 of 2018\n-4-\nRs.1 lakh, which is only ten per cent of the\ncompensation awarded by the trial court. In\nthe said circumstances, I do notâ€™ find\nanything to interfere with Annexure-A3 order\npassed by the appellate court.\nIn the result, this Crl.M.C. stands\ndismissed.\nSd/-\nB.
