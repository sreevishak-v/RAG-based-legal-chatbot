He\npleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.\n\n5. On the side of prosecution, PW1 to PW2 were examined and Exhibit P1 was\nmarked.

If the accused is found guilty? What is the order as to sentence?\n\n8. Point Nos. 1 to 4 :-To avoid repetition and for brevity, points are considered\ntogether. Prosecution case is that accused has committed offences punishable\n\nunder sections 294(b), 341, 353 and 506(i) of the Indian Penal Code, 1860\n\n40f5\n\n9. Evidence adduced by the prosecution :_ PW1 admitted her signature in the Ext\nP1 FI statement .She deposed that the alleged incident took place on 25.8. 2019\nand on that day she was engaged in taking the census of each ward .Further\nshe deposed that when she was collecting data from a house 1-2 persons came\nto there and deterred her from performing the duty .According to her the\naccused was not the person who deterred her from performing the duty .\n\n10. PW2, Gopakumar is the husband of PW1. He deposed that on that alleged day\nhe hadn't witnessed the accused assaulting PW1 and according to him there\nwere a bunch of people and he is not able to say whether the accused was\npresent on that day .\n\n11. Analysis of evidence : Prosecution has examined only PW1 and PW2. The\nevidence of PW1 and PW2 itself shows that they weren’t aware of the accused\nand according to PW1 she cannot recognize the accused.\n\n12. Learned Assistant Public Prosecutor has given up the other witnesses in this\ncase and she is justified in doing so as the material witness failed to support the\nprosecution case. There is nothing on record to disclose that the accused has\ncommitted the offences as alleged by the prosecution. Having considered the\nevidence on record, this court is of the view that the prosecution has failed to\nprove the guilt of the accused and for the said reasons, these points are found\nagainst the prosecution.\n\n5 O0f5\n13. Point No. 5 :- As a result, the accused is found not guilty of offences\npunishable under sections 294(b), 341, 353 and 506(i) of the Indian Penal\nCode, 1860 and he is acquitted of the said offences under section 255(1)Cr.PC.\nHis bail bond stands cancelled and he is set at liberty.\nNo material objects are produced in this case.\nDictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected by me\nand pronounced in the open court on this the 7\" day of March, 2025.\nSd/-\nJudicial I Class Magistrate-V,\nThiruvananthapuram.\nAPPENDIX\nFORM 62\nList of Prosecution/Defence /Court Witnesses\n(Rule 134 Criminal Rules of Practice, Kerala)\nWhether Eye witness, Police\nRank Name witness, Expert witness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nPa\nB.
