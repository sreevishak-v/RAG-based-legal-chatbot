Geenakumary\n\nThis petition came up for hearing on 04/03/2025 and the court on 05/03/2025\n\npassed the following :\nORDER\nThis is an application filed by the 3™ accused in the above crime\nunder Section 483 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking regular\nbail.\nCriminal M.C.No.660/2025 1/5\n\n2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable\nunder Sections 189(2), 189(3), 189(4), 191(1), 191(8), 296(b), 126(2), 115(2),\n118(1), 118(2), 109 and 351 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.\n\n3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- On 20.07.2024 at\nabout 5.30 p.m., the accused, eight in number, formed themselves into an unlawful\nassembly and accused Nos. 1 and 2 wrongfully restrained him, and went from\nthere. Thereafter, at about 6.30 p.m., the 1* accused, by using an iron rod, beat\nthe defacto complainant on his left knee, and the 2™ accused hacked him on his\nhead, using the chopper. Then, accused Nos. 3 and 4 fisted the defacto\ncomplainant on his face and forehead, using a sharp object, causing injuries, and\nthe other four accused persons beat and fisted the defacto complainant, and the 3\"\naccused threatened him, and the 2\" accused poured arrack into the mouth and face\nof the defacto complainant.\n\n4. Reportedly, the petitioner/ 3\" accused was arrested on 15.02.2025 and\nhe is in custody since then.\n\n5. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The\nInvestigating Officer filed report opposing the bail application.\n\nCriminal M.C.No.660/2025 2/5\n\n6. Heard. Perused the records.\n\n7. The only point to be considered is, whether regular bail can be\ngranted to the petitioner/ 3\" accused.\n\n8. The Point:- The petitioner/ 3 accused along with other accused is\nalleged to have assaulted the defacto complainant. Allegedly, the 2\" accused, by\nusing a chopper, and accused Nos. 3 and 4, by using a sharp weapon, attacked the\ndefacto complainant, causing injuries. The motive of the alleged incident is the\nanimosity against the defacto complainant as he pointed the house of the 1*\naccused to the police in connection with a theft case.\n\n9. According to the petitioner, he is innocent of the allegations levelled\nagainst him, and there is delay in registering the First Information Report. It is\nsubmitted that, the defacto complainant, who is the brother-in-law of the accused,\nafter consuming alcohol, fallen somewhere and caused injuries, and due to his\npersonal animosity, the present case has been falsely foisted against the petitioner\nand three others. The petitioner submits that, his wife is a chronic cancer patient\nand there is no one to look after her.\n\nCriminal M.C.No.660/2025 3/5\n\n10. The gravity of the offence alleged is grave. Allegedly, the petitioner /\n3\" accused along with the other accused had assaulted the defacto complainant,\ncausing severe injuries. The petitioner herein is alleged to have hit against the\nface and forehead of the defacto complainant, using a sharp weapon. It is reported\nthat the iron rod and chopper used for the commission of the offence were\nrecovered. The wound certificate and treatment summary of the defacto\ncomplainant produced along with the report shows that, he had sustained severe\ninjuries, including traumatic brain injury and soft tissue contusions. He was\ntreated at Community Health Centre, Vellanadu§ and S.K.Hospital,\nThiruvananthapuram. So the prosecution has made out a prima face case against\nthe petitioner/ 3 accused and regarding the involvement of the petitioner in the\nalleged offence. It is stated in the report that the 4\" accused is yet to be arrested\nand four other accused persons arrayed as accused Nos. 5 to 8 are to be identified.\nThe investigation is progressing. The petitioner / 3 accused is in judicial custody\nonly for a period of 18 days. If the petitioner / 3\" accused is released on bail, he is\nlikely to influence or intimidate the defacto complainant and other witnesses, and\ntamper with the evidence. So, the investigation will be adversely affected. The\nchance of absconding also cannot be ruled out. Considering all these aspects,\n\nCriminal M.C.No.660/2025 4/5\n\nincluding the gravity of the offence, this court is not inclined to release the\npetitioner on bail at this stage.\nIn the result, this petition is dismissed.\nDictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and pronounced by\nme in Open Court on this the 5\" day of March, 2025.\nSd/-\nNAZEERA 5S.\nSESSIONS JUDGE\n(Copies : 4) //True Copy// (By Order)\nTyped by: Soumya\nCompared by:Maniusha FCS: SHERISTADAR\nCriminal M.C.No.660/2025 5/5\n\nCopy of Order in\nCriminal M.C.No.660/2025\nDated 05/03/2025\nCriminal M.C.No.660/2025 6/5\n\n"
