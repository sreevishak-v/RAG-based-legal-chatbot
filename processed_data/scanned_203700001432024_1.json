V. SREEJA (PP)\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n09.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nEel\n2024/KER/4656\nCRL.MC_143/2024\n2\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J\narea\nORDER\nPetitioner challenges the proceedings in C.C.1417/2021 on the\nfiles of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Pala alleging\noffences punishable under Section 406, 420, 417, 468, 471 and\n120B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Petitioner is the first\naccused in the said crime.\n\n2. According to the prosecution, petitioner had misused the\ngeneral power of attorney given by the de facto complainant\nand, on that basis, transferred 1/4\" right of the de facto\ncomplainant to the second accused, apart from creating other\ndocuments transferring properties to his wife, the second\naccused. Petitioner is also alleged to have forged the signature\nof the de facto complainant and canceled the power of\nattorney, and thereby committed the offences alleged.\n\n3. Sri.M.P.Madhavankutty, the learned counsel for the petitioner,\n\nEel\nBSR\n2024/KER/4656\nCRL.MC 143/2024\n3\n\ncontended that the allegations against the 2°! accused, who is\nthe wife of the petitioner, has already been settled and the\nproceedings against her were quashed as per Annexure-VII\njudgment of this Court. It was further submitted that a civil\nsuit filed by the de facto complainant against the petitioner and\nothers were dismissed, and the appeal filed as R.F.A\nNo.504/11 was also dismissed, as the matter was settled\nbetween the parties. However, since the petitioner was not\navailable in station at that time the criminal case against the\npetitioner could not be settled. The learned counsel further\nsubmitted that prosecution allegations are not at all made out\nfrom the materials collected, and therefore, the continuance of\nthe proceedings before the trial court is an abuse of the process\nof the court. It was also submitted that the case is based on a\nforged document, which was not even made part of the\nevidence collected during the investigation, and therefore the\ncontinuance of the proceedings before the trial court is a waste\nof time.\n\n4. I have heard Smt.Sreeja v., the learned Public Prosecutor as\n\nEel\nBSR\n2024/KER/4656\nCRL.MC 143/2024\n4\n\nwell.\n\n5. The prosecution allegation is that the accused had misused the\npower of attorney of his brother and transferred properties and\nalso forged a deed of cancellation of the power of attorney\nexecuted in petitioner’s favour. It is also alleged that the\naccused carried out the same with an intention to cheat the de\nfacto complainant, who is none other than the brother of the\npetitioner, who had allegedly entrusted the property to be\nmanaged while he was residing in the United States of\nAmerica.\n\n6. It is relevant to notice at this juncture that, even though the\ncase against the 2\"4 accused has already been settled, the case\nagainst the petitioner has not yet been settled.\n\n7. The contention of the petitioner that the material collected by\nthe prosecution is not sufficient to bring home the guilt of the\naccused, it is a matter that can be agitated before the trial\ncourt in accordance with law. The scope of interference under\nSection 482 of Cr.P.C. is very limited. Unless the admitted\nallegations do not make out an offence as alleged, the remedy\n\nEel\nERE\n2024/KER/4656\nCRL.MC 143/2024\n5\nunder Section 482 of Cr.P.C. cannot be invoked.\n\n8. A perusal of the final report filed in C.C.1417/2021 on the files\n\nof the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Pala, reveals that\nthe admitted allegations definitely make out the ingredients of\nthe offences alleged. A power of attorney issued to the\npetitioner is alleged to have been misused to transfer large\nextent of properties in favour of the wife of the petitioner.\nThe offences alleged are serious in nature and the allegations if\nadmitted do make out the crime as alleged. However, as\nmentioned above, if the materials collected are not sufficient to\nbring home a charge against the petitioner, definitely the\nremedy is elsewhere.\n\n9. In such circumstances, the remedy under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.\ncannot be invoked. However, reserving the liberty of the\npetitioner to initiate appropriate proceedings as per the\nprovisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973; this\nCrl.M.C. is dismissed.\n\nsd/-\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\nAMV/11/01/2024\n\nel\nisan!\n2024/KER/4656\nCRL.MC 1143/2024\n6\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 143/2024\n\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES\n\nANNEXURE -I A TRUE COPY OF THE COMPLAINT DATED 12-\n01-2013 SUBMITTED BEFORE SUB INSPECTOR\nOF POLICE, PALA\n\nANNEXURE -II A TRUE COPY OF THE FIR IN CRIME\nNO.57/2013 OF PALA POLICE STATION\n\nANNEXURE -III THE CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT\n\nANNEXURE -IV A TRUE COPY OF THE JUDGMENT IN 0.S.
