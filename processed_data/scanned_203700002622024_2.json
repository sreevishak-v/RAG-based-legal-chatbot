In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303],\nthe Apex Court has held that in appropriate cases, the High Court can\ntake note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim\nand the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. This\nview was reiterated in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6\nSCC 466] and Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State of Jharkhand\nand Another [(2014) 9 SCC 653].\n\n7. | have perused Annexure 2 affidavit filed by respondents 2\nand 3. The learned Public Prosecutor has submitted that upon\nverification, it is understood that the affidavit is genuine, and the\ndefacto complainant and the other deponent stand by the contens\nthereof. | am satisfied that the matter has been settled and no public\ninterest is involved in this case. There is no impediment for granting\nthe prayer for quashing. The continuance of the proceedings will only\nbe an exercise in futility.\n\n8.
