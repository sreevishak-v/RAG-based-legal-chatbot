EE\n\nDated this the 3\" day of January, 2017\nORDER\nThe petitioner is the defacto complainant in\nCC.No.1072/2009 of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,\nKoyilandy for offences punishable under Sections 465,\n466, 469, 471 and 417 read with Section 34 of the Indian\nPenal Code. The defacto complainant was examined as\nPW5. The matter was thereafter posted for hearing. It\nseems that at the time of hearing, interpretation was\ngiven by one of the counsel, regarding a sentence in the\ndeposition of PW2. On the basis of that contentions, an\napplication to recall PW2 was filed by the APP. The court\nbelow by its order in Annexure-C order dismissed the\napplication filed under Section 311 of the Cr.P.C. This was\ncarried in revision before the Sessions court in\nCrl.R.P.No.105 of 2015. The revisional court accepted the\nview taken by the court below and dismissed the revision.\nThis is under challenge in this Crl.M.C.\n\n2. Heard both sides and examined the records.\n\nDrea\n\nsormenny\nCrl.M.C.No.102 of 2016 2\nThe disputed sentence is extracted of the order, at page\n21. The contentions of both sides before the courts below\nas well as before this court revolved around the correct\ninterpretation and the purport of that portion of\ndeposition. In the course of deciding the application\nunder Section 311 of Cr.P.C, both courts were\ninadvertently dragged to express their interpretation of\nthat sentence, which I feel was unnecessary and\nunwarranted. Definitely both courts could not have\nrefrained from venturing into that since the courts were\ninvited by both sides to render its finding on that portion\nof deposition.\n\n3. I feel that this exercise was. absolutely\nunnecessary in the absence of any allegation that the\nevidence of PW2 was not correctly recorded or that there\nwas any ambiguity in the mode of recording by the court\nbelow. It is for the trial court at the time of final hearing\nto decide what exactly did the witness mean by that\nportion of deposition. The courts are not expected to cull\nout a sentence from the deposition and to give an\n\nDrea\nsormenny\nCrl.M.C.No.102 of 2016 3\nopinion, de hors the circumstances under which that\nevidence was given. Evidently deposition has to be\nappreciated as a whole. By calling upon the court to give\nits opinion regarding that sentence, virtually the parties\nwere preempting the issue which did not arise at that\nstage of S.311 Cr.P.C. Having regard to this fact, I feel\nthat there is no scope for recalling the witness and it is for\nthe trial court at the time of final hearing to consider the\ntrue intention of the witness, the correct explanation of\nthat portion of deposition and the circumstances under\nwhich the witness gave that answer. It is to be\nindependently considered by the trial court, untrammeled\nby any observation and any comments made by both the\ncourts below. In the light of above, this Crl.M.C fails and\nis dismissed. The court below shall proceed to pronounce\nthe judgment on the basis of evidence let it.\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE\nRAV ITRUE COPY/I\nPATO JUDGE\n\n"
