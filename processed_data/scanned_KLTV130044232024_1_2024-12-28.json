Petitioner/accused was arrested and produced before this court on 26.12.2024.\nSince then he has been in judicial custody. Thus this petition.\n\n5. Areport was called for from SHO, Mannanthala police station. Report filed by\nthe SHO Mannanthala Police Station dated 27.12.2024 stating that the investi-\ngation in the above case is going on and if accused is enlarged on bail he may\nflee from justice and also there is a chance that the evidence will be tampered.\n\n6. Heard both sides. The following point has arisen for consideration ?\n\nIs the petitioner /accused entitled to be released on bail ?\n\n7. Point :- The learned counsel for the petitioner / accused submitted that the al-\nlegations of prosecution is false. The learned counsel submitted that the matter\nhas been settled between the informant and the accused/ The learned counsel\nwas also submitted that, the ingredients of Sec. 110 is not attracted in the facts\nof the case.\n\n8. The learned Assistant Public Prosecutor argued that the offences alleged\nagainst the accused is serious in nature and he has serious similar criminal an-\ntecedents. Since the investigation is at the initial stage, and his custody is re-\nquired hence this application has to be rejected.\n\n9. The Honourable Apex Court in PB Chidambaram y. Directorate of Enforce-\nment 2020 AIR SC 1699 held that \"The jurisdiction to grant bail has to be\nexercised on the basis of the well - settled principles having regard to the\nfacts and circumstances of each case. The following factors are to be taken\ninto consideration while considering an application for bail: - (i) the nature\n\n3\n\nof accusation and the severity of the punishment in the case of conviction\nand the nature of materials relied upon by the prosecution; (ii) reasonable\napprehension of tampering with the witnesses or apprehension of threat to\nthe complainant or the witnesses; (iii) reasonable possibility of securing the\npresence of the accused at the time of trial or the likelihood of his abscon-\ndence; (iv) character behaviour and standing of the accused and the circum-\nstances which are peculiar to the accused; (v) larger interest of the public or\nthe State and similar other considerations (vide Prahlad Singh Bhati v. NCT,\nDelhi and another 2001 (4) SCC 280. There is no hard and fast rule regard-\ning grant or refusal to grant bail. Each case has to be considered on the facts\nand circumstances of each case and on its own merits.\n\n10. I have heard contentions of both parties and perused the records of prosecution.\nWhile analysing to the fact of the case, it can be seen that the allegations lev-\nelled against the accused is serious in nature, the investigation is at the initial\nstage and custody of the accused is required for effective investigation. Hence\nconsidering the facts and circumstances of the case, stage of investigation, na-\nture of the allegations made against the accused and in the light of judgments\nof Honourable Apex Court this court is of the view that further detention of the\naccused is required and the accused is not entitled to be released on bail at this\nstage. Hence, I am not inclined to allow the bail application .\n\nAs aresult, this bail application is dismissed .\nDictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected by me and\npronounced by me in open court on this the 28\" day of December, 2024.\nSd/-\nJudicial First Class Magistrate-V,\nThiruvananthapuram.\n//True copy//\n\n"
