P18 FIR was\nregistered.\n\n18. Evaluation of the evidence : The prosecution case is that Accused no.1 to 4\ncommitted robbery of gold omaments and cash from CW1 .The specific\nallegation against the accused no.5 is that he had received 26 grams of gold\nworth Rs.11000/- with the knowledge that the same was stolen property and\nadmitted other accused persons to conceal the gold. The prosecution has no\ncase that the accused no.5 had taken part in the commission of robbery that has\ncommitted by accused no. 1 to 4. The only allegation against accused No.5 is\nu/s. 414 of Indian Penal Code, 1860.\n\n19. 5.414 of Indian Penal Code provides that 414. Assisting in concealment of\nstolen property.—\n\nWhoever voluntarily assists in concealing or disposing of or making away with\nproperty which he knows or has reason to believe to be stolen property, shall be\npunished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend\nto three years, or with fine, or with both.\n\nIn order to prove the offence w/s.414 of the Indian Penal Code 1860 the\nprosecution has to prove that\n\n10 of 16\n\n1) that the property involved in the offence is stolen property\n2) the accused voluntarily assisted someone in concealing or disposing of or\nmaking away with the such property .\n3) The accused had the knowledge and reason to believe that the property was\nstolen .\nThat in order to attract the offence u/s.414 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 what\nthe prosecution has to prove is that the accused has voluntarily assisted in\nstealing or disposing or making away with the property which he knows or has\nthe reason to believe to be a stolen property .The person who had received\nstolen property will not be come w/s.414 asper the provisions of S.414 of IPC\nbut the person who assisted the concealment or disposal will only come under\nthe ambit of Sec. 414 of Indian Penal Code, 1860. Another aspect is that the\nprosecution has to prove that the property which was stolen and property which\nwas recovered are identical .\n\n20. In Ajendranath v. State of MP 1963 KHC 408, the essential ingredients of\ns.414 of IPC , observed by honourable apex court as follows.\n“Lastly, it was also urged that even if the identity of the articles recovered with\nthe articles stolen be established, no offence under S. 414 IPC, is made out\nagainst the appellant as the other accused have been acquitted and it is not\n\n11 of 16\n\nknown whom the appellant is supposed to have helped in concealing the stolen\nproperty. S. 414 IPC makes it an offence for a person to assist voluntarily in\nstealing or disposing of or making away with property which he knows or has\nreason to believe to be stolen property. It is not necessary for a person to be\nconvicted under S. 414 IPC, that another person must be traced out convicted\nof an offence of committing theft. The prosecution has simply to establish\nthat the propety recovered is stolen property and that the appellant provided\nhelp in its concealment and disposal.\n\n21. Now let's examine the evidence of prosecution .S.Gopakumar who was\nexamined as PW1 had only hearsay knowledge regarding the\nincident .According to him on getting the information that a robbery he went to\nBalaramapuram police station and found his father there .PW2 Padmanabhan\nwas examined by the prosecution to prove the stock register balance of the said\nshop on that particular day .PW 7 Naneswar was examined by the prosecution\nto prove the recovery of MO1 gold ingot which is weighed 55.500 gm _,which\naccording to him was purchased from one suresh who was not the accused .\nPW8, Visweswaran identified the gold chain marked as MO2 ,which was given\nby him to the police .PW9 R.S Vinod identified his signature in the Ext p1\nmahasar .PW18 Thampi deposed that at the time of preparing Ext P8\nmahasar ,the police produced some other person and not the accused .Allother\nwitnesses were examined by the prosecution to prove the recovery of gold\n\n12 of 16\nornaments upon the information given by the accused persons. ‘There is\nnothing in the evidence of PW1 to PW28 to exhibit that accused No. 5 has\nconcealed the gold ornaments. There is no other direct evidence to show that\nthe accused was assisted in concealing the gold ornaments .PW29 Shaji was\nthe sub inspector during the time of incident .He deposed that asper the\nconfession made by the first accused that he entrusted gold ornaments to\naccused no.6 Sadanandan ,he questioned him and accused no.6 stated that he\nentrusted it to Noval Prasad, who is arrayed as 5\" accused. Later based on the\nconfession of him the gold ornaments of 15.700 gm were recovered from one\nMr.Thankappan as per Ext P17 recovery mahasar .The relevant portion of\ninformation that given to the police was marked as Ext P 17 (a) is extracted as\nfollows “aoeldvs amod BG AIAVEMMBo MaNAVjAIO MéAflaJ age\nALEMNOEOIM’ SPHAISo AMEgIJO OMQIGIVAD MIGINHS MSGHAM Oe&e40\nagimwosee” 11000/- Galas” amog@m GaGS06 HaddeN148 alesse” He further\ndeposed that he registered the Ext P18 FIR against the present accused . On\nanalysing the evidence ,it can be seen that apart from the evidence of PW29\nthat a recovery has been effected by him ,no other evidence pertaining to the\nallegation that the accused assisted in concealing the gold ornaments .The said\nThankappan was not examined by the prosecution .Moreover the gold\nornaments which alleged as recovered was not identified by the PW29 or by\nany other witnesses.In fact the prosecution has not proved that the gold\nornaments that were recovered as per Ext P17 from CW30 Thankappan and the\n\n13 of 16\n\ngold ornaments that alleged as robbed are one and the same . In short there is\nno direct evidence or any other circumstantial evidence to prove that the\npresent accused assisted the other accused persons to conceal the gold\nornaments . The available evidence on record is hardly sufficient to find that\nthe accused no.5 committed any offence u/s.414 of IPC as alleged by the\nprosecution beyond any reasonable doubt .\n39. Point No.3 :- Upon the finding in point Nos. 1 and 2, the accused No.5 is\nfound not guilty of offence punishable under sections 414 of Indian Penal\nCode, 1860 and he is acquitted of the said offences under section 248(1) Code\nof Criminal Procedure, 1973. His bail bonds stand cancelled and he is set at\nliberty.\nCase against Accused No.4 is split up and refiled as CC.446/2002.\nThe material objects were produced before this court will be destroyed after the\nappeal period is over according to law .\n\nDictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected by me and\n\npronounced in the open court on this the 6\" day of December, 2024.\n\nSd/-\nJudicial First Class Magistrate-V,\nThiruvananthapuram.\n\n14 of 16\nAPPENDIX\nWhether Eye witness,\nOther witness\n\n15 of 16\nPW22 | Thankamony Other witness\nB.
