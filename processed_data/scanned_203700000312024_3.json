Petitioner is the accused in Crime No. 1886/2023 of Thaliparamba\nPolice Station, Kannur District, registered for the offences under Section\n308 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Third respondent is the defacto\ncomplainant.\n\n3. According to the prosecution, the accused assaulted the defacto\ncomplainant and thereby committed the offences alleged.\n\n4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned\ncounsel for the respondent, apart from the learned Public Prosecutor.\n\n5. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the matter\nhas been settled and hence the proceedings against the petitioner ought\nto be quashed. It was also submitted that, considering the nature of\noffences alleged, no purpose would be served by continuing the\nproceedings.\n\n6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and Another [(2012) 10 SCC\n303], the Apex Court has held that in appropriate cases, the High Court\n\n2024/KER/4462\nCrl.M.C.No.31 of 2024\n4:\n\ncan take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim\nand the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. This view\nwas reiterated in Narinder Singh and Others v. State of Punjab and\nAnother [(2014) 6 SCC 466] and Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State\n\nof Jharkhand and Another [(2014) 9 SCC 653].\n\n7. | have perused Annexure-B affidavit filed by the third respondent.\nThe learned Public Prosecutor has submitted that upon verification, it is\nunderstood that the affidavit is genuine, and the defacto complainant\nstands by the contents thereof. | am satisfied that the matter has been\nsettled and no public interest is involved in this case. There is no\nimpediment for granting the prayer for quashing. The continuance of the\nproceedings will only be an exercise in futility.\n\n8. Accordingly, all proceedings against the petitioner in\nCrime No. 1886/2023 of Thaliparamba Police Station, Kannur District, are\nquashed.\n\nThis Crl.M.C is allowed as above.\n\nSd/-\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\nJka/19.01.24.\n\ndot\n2024/KER/4462\nCri.M.C.No.31 of 2024\n-51-\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 31/2024\nPETITIONER’S ANNEXURES\nAnnexure A A TRUE COPY OF THE FIRST INFORMATION\nREPORT IN CRIME NO: 1886/2023 OF\nTHALIPARAMBA POLICE STATION, KANNUR\nDISTRICT DATED 16.12.2023.\nAnnexure B AFFIDAVIT OF THE 3RD RESPONDENT DATED\n28.12.2023,\n\n"
