This is a case instituted upon the Final Report filed by the Sub Inspector of\nPolice, Thumba Police Station in Crime No. 74/2014 for the offences punishable\nunder Sections 324, 342, 326 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.\n2. The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: Due to the prior animosity\ntowards the Informant, all the three Accused persons, in furtherance of their\ncommon intention to voluntarily cause grievous hurt to the Informant, assaulted\nhim on 19.01.2014 at 9.30 pm at , Kulathoor, Attipra. The 1% and 2™! Accused came\nin some motor cycle, stopped the same in front of the Informant and the i*\nAccused punched the Informant below his right eye and also on his right cheek\nwith a piece of granite stone lying on the road, thereby causing fracture on right\nmaxilla and right zygoma. Thereafter, the 3™ Accused along with the others had\nrestrained him wrongfully, and the 3™ Accused heavily hit on his chest with a\ngranite stone piece lying on the road. Thereby the Accused are alleged to have\ncommitted the above mentioned offences.\n3. The cognizance was taken on the basis of Final Report in respect of the\noffences under Sections 324, 342, 326 r/w 34 of the IPC. The summons was issued\nonly to the 3™ Accused as the 1Stand 2™ Accused were reported to be no more in\nthe Final Report itself. On issuance of process, the 3% Accused entered\n\n3\nappearance. He was enlarged on bail. He was represented by a Counsel of his own\nchoice. Copies of all relevant Prosecution records were furnished to him. After\nhearing both parties and on perusing relevant records, charge framed for the\noffences punishable under Sections 324, 342, 326 r/w 34 of the IPC and the same\nwas read over and explained to him, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to\nbe tried.\n4. From the side of Prosecution CWs1 to 4 were examined as PWs1 to 4\nrespectively. The remaining witnesses were given up by the Learned APP as the\nmaterial witnesses had turned hostile to the case of Prosecution. Since no\nincriminating circumstances arose from the depositions of the witnesses, the\nexamination of the Accused under Section 313(1)(b) of the CrPC was dispensed\nwith. No Defence evidence was adduced.\n5. Heard both sides and perused the documents. The following points arise for\nconsideration.\n(a) Has the 3\"? Accused along with the other Accused, in furtherance of their\ncommon intention, voluntarily caused hurt to PW1 with granite stone piece\nand thereby committed the offence punishable under section 324 r/w 34 of\nthe IPC as alleged\n(b) Has the 3™ Accused along with the other Accused, in furtherance\nof their common intention, wrongfully restrained PW1 and thereby\ncommitted offence punishable under Section 342 of the IPC as alleged?\n(c) Has the 3™ Accused along with the other Accused, in furtherance of\ntheir common intention, voluntarily caused grievous hurt to PW1, resulting\nin him sustaining fracture and thereby committed the offence punishable\nunder section 326 r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged?\n(d) If so, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded?\n\n4\n6. Points (a) to (c): These points are considered together for the sake of\nbrevity and for avoiding repetition.\n\nPW1 deposed that he knows the incident. He doesn’t remember the date of\noccurrence. And that it was on 2016 at Kulathoor, Ambalamukku about 6.30 pm.\nTwo persons, whom he does not remember attempted to assault him. They did not\nstole his ornamentsHe could not identify the Accused persons. He denied having\ngiven statement to the police to the effect that he sustained injury in the incident\nand that his jewellery was stolen.\n\nPWs2, 3 and 4 deposed that they know PW1, but denied having witnessed the\nincident and to have given statement to the police to that effect.\n\nI have carefully considered the evidence adduced by the Prosecution and the\nmaterials on record. It is pertinent to note that PW1, the injured himself is having\nno complaint or allegations that the 3™ Accused had voluntarily cause grevious\nhurt to him. In fact, according to him two persons whom he does not remember\nhad attacked him. No such injury as alleged by the Prosecution is deposed to by\nthe Informant. The occurrence witnesses also denied the case of the Prosecution.\nThe remaining witnesses were given up by the Prosecution as no purpose would be\nserved in examining the remaining witness, when the Injured himself has no case\nsupporting the Prosecution.\n\nOn perusal of the evidence led by the Prosecution and the materials on\nrecord, it is clear from the testimony of PW1 itself that there is no evidence to\nsupport the Prosecution case. None of the ingredients of the alleged offences are\nmade out from the evidence adduced. There is nothing available on record to\nimplicate the 34 Accused to the above incident. Hence, on a total consideration of\nfacts and circumstances of the above case and on appreciation of the evidence\nadduced, this Court finds that the Prosecution has failed to prove the case against\nthe 3% Accused and therefore, Points (a) to (c) are found in favour of the 3\nAccused.\n\n5\n7. Point (d): In light of finding in the foregoing points, this point does not\narise for consideration.\n\nIn the result, the 3™ Accused is found not guilty of having committed the\noffences punishable under Sections 324, 342, 326r/w 34 of the IPC. He is acquitted\nof the aforesaid offences under Section 248(1) of the CrPC. His bail bond stands\ncancelled and he is set at liberty.\n\n(Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her,\ncorrected by me and pronounced in open Court on this, the 5\" day of December,\n2024.)\n\nJudicial Magistrate of I Class -I,\nThiruvananthapuram\nAPPENDIX\nA: Prosecution witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nPW1 ithin (CW1) examined on 12- |Occurrence Witness\n07.2022\nPW2 Vivek V (CW2) examined on |Occurrence witness\n04.07.2023\nPW3 Ginesh (CW3) examined on Occurrence Witness\n04.07.2023\nPW4 Vinil (CW4) examined on Occurrence Witness\n20.11.2024\n\n6\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\n————\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA.
