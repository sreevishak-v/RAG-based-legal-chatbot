SRI.MAHESH V.MENON\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON\n07.01.2019, ALONG WITH Cr1.MC.8849/2017, THE COURT ON THE SAME\nDAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nee\nCrl.MC.No. 8849 & 8851 of 2017 201KERII6\n3\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner faces prosecution proceedings in two cases\npending before the Judicial Magistrate of the First Class-II, Thrissur. In\nC.C.No0.4503 of 2014, the de facto complainant is his wife. In the said\ncase, he is being proceeded against for having committed offence\npunishable under Section 498A of the IPC. In C.C.No.4230 of 2014,\nthe de facto complainant is his daughter and he is accused of having\ncommitted offence punishable under Sections 323, 354A, 506(i) and\n509 of the IPC. Both these cases are sought to be quashed by these\npetitions filed under Section 482 of the CrP.C.\n\n2. I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the\npetitioner, the learned counsel appearing for the respective de facto\ncomplainants in both cases, who have been arrayed as the 2\"\nrespondent in these proceedings, and the learned Public Prosecutor.\n\n3. The learned counsel appearing for both sides submitted that\nthe entire disputes were referred to the Ernakulam Mediation Centre\nand the parties were able to arrive at a settlement. As per the terms,\nthe petitioner had agreed to pay Rs.28,00,000/- to his wife and\nRs.20,00,000/- to his daughter. The de facto complainants had agreed\nto hand over the title deeds of the residential home and the keys of\n\nCrl.MC.No. 8849 & 8851 of 2017 201KERII6\n4\nthe building.\n\n4. When the case was taken up today, the learned counsel\nappearing for the petitioner has handed over two demand drafts for\nthe agreed amount and the learned counsel appearing for the\nrespondents have handed over the documents as well as the keys. It\nis submitted by the learned counsel appearing for both sides that the\nentire disputes having been settled, the continuance of proceedings\nagainst the petitioner is an abuse of process.\n\n5. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted\nthat the statement of the de facto complainant has been recorded and\nshe has stated in clear terms that she has no subsisting grievance.\n\n6. Ihave considered the submissions advanced.\n\n6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303] and in\nNarinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466], the Apex\nCourt has laid down that in appropriate cases, the High Court can take\nnote of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim and the\nwrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. Further in\nJitendra_Raghuvanshi_& Others v. Babita Raghuvanshi &\nAnother [(2013) 4 SCC 58], it was observed that it is the duty of the\ncourts to encourage genuine settlements of matrimonial disputes. If\nthe parties ponder over their faults and terminate their disputes\n\nCrl.MC.No. 8849 & 8851 of 2017 201KERII6\n5\n\namicably by mutual agreement instead of fighting it out in a court of\n\nlaw, the courts should not hesitate to exercise its powers under\n\nSection 482 of the Code. Permitting such proceedings to continue\n\nwould be nothing, but an abuse of process of court. The interest of\n\njustice also require that the proceedings be quashed.\n\n7. Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I am of\nthe considered view that this Court will be well justified in invoking its\nextraordinary powers under Section 482 of the Code to quash the\nproceedings.\n\nIn the result, these petitions will stand allowed. Annexure-Al\nfinal reports in both cases and all proceedings pursuant thereto\nagainst the petitioner now pending as C.C. Nos.4230/2014 and\nC.C.No. 4503/2014 on the file of Judicial Magistrate of First Class-II,\nThrissur are quashed.\n\nSd/-\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN V.,\nJUDGE\n//TRUE COPY// P.A.
