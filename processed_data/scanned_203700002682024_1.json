CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION\nON 12.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE\nFOLLOWING:\n\na\nCRL.MC NO. 268 OF 2024 E/E!\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.\n~ Cri.M.C. No.268 of 2024\nDated this the 12\" day of January, 2024\nORDER\n\nPetitioners challenge Annexure-A2 FIR in Crime No.453 of\n2023 of Pathanamthitta Police Station. The offences alleged\nagainst the petitioners are under Sections 420 and 506 read\nwith Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.\n\n2. According to the prosecution, the accused had\npromised to provide employment at Poland and collected an\namount of Rs.21,00,000/- and thereafter, failed to provide the\nemployment or return the amount and thereby, the accused\ncommitted the offences alleged.\n\n3. Sri. George Mathew Karamayil, the learned counsel for\nthe petitioners contended that, the entire prosecution\nallegations are false and the petitioners are totally innocent. It\nis also submitted that, the real culprit behind the alleged\noffence is the defacto complainant himself and that, the\npetitioners have no involvement in this crime.\n\n4. | have heard Sri. Aashi M.C., learned Public\n\nal\nTein\n2024/KER/2896\nCRL.MC NO. 268 OF 2024\nProsecutor as well.\n5. The crime is only at the investigation stage and it is\ntoo premature a stage to consider the merits of the allegations.\n| am of the view that, the case does not fall within the\nexceptional circumstances contemplated in the decision in\nState of Hariyana & Others v. Bhajanlal & Others (1992\nSuppl. (1) SCC 335) to invoke the inherent jurisdiction under\nSection 482 of Cr.P.C. to quash the FIR itself.\nTherefore, | find no merit in this Criminal M.C.,and it is\ndismissed.\nSd/-\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\nLU\n\nel\noo\nie: ane\n2024/KER/2896\nCRL.MC NO. 268 OF 2024\n1+Dae\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 268/2024\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES :\nANNEXURE At TRUE COPY OF COURSE AND CONDUCT\nCERTIFICATE DTD.15.05.2023 ISSUED FROM\nNOORUL ISLAM CENTRE FOR HIGHER\nEDUCATION AT KUMARACOTL IN KANYAKUMARI\nDISTRICT OF TAMIL NADU\nANNEXURE A2 TRUE COPY OF COPY OF FIRST INFORMATION\nREPORT (FIR) DTD. 05.04.2023 IN CR.
