The defacto complainant filed a complaint alleging\nmatrimonial cruelty against her husband arraying him as the\nfirst accused and the petitioners herein as accused Nos. 2 and 3.\nOn the basis of the complaint lodged, investigation was\ncompleted, the final report was laid and the matter is now\npending as CC No.498/2015 of JFCM Court, Ottapalam.\nCrl.M.C.is laid on a premise that Annexure Al compliant does\nnot disclose the essential ingredients of an offence punishable\nunder Section 498(A). It was contended by the learned counsel,\nrelying on page 2 of the complaint, that the second and third\naccused were only the neighbours. There was no demand from\nthem for dowry also. There was no averment that the cruelty was\nof such a gravity as to drive the defacto complainant to commit\nsuicide.\n\n3. In the light of the above contentions, the learned public\n\nmeatal\nBle\n2016/KER/33869\nCri.M.C. No.516/2016 2\nprosecutor was directed to ascertain as to whether the\npetitioners herein are related to the first accused. After\nverification, learned public prosecutor had submitted that the\nfirst petitioner was the uncle of the first accused and the\nsecond petitioner was the wife of the first petitioner. This was\nrecorded by order dated 24/6/2016. There are averments in\nthe complaint that the first and the second accused had\nassaulted the defacto complainant and threatened to kill her if\nshe returned to the house. There are other averments\ntouching upon the cruelty meted out on her.\n\n4. Having regard to the above facts, I am satisfied that\nthe contentions set up by the petitioners herein will not\nsurvive. Having regard to this, I am inclined to dismiss the\nCrl.M.C. reserving the right of the petitioner herein to raise\nall the above contentions before the trial court.\n\nWith the above observation, the Crl.M.C.is dismissed.\n\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS\nJudge\ndpk\n/true copy/ PS to Judge.\n\nBig ael\ni\nBurk\n2016/KER/33869\nCri.M.C.
