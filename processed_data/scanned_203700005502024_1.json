CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n18.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\n2024/KER/4267\nCRL.MC 550/2024\n2\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J\na anareneaa\nORDER\nPetitioner seeks to quash the prosecution initiated against him,\nby invoking the jurisdiction under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.\n\n2. Petitioner is the first accused in C.C.No.177/2021 on the files of\nthe Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Payyannur, arising out\nof Crime No.315/2019 of Cherupuzha Police Station, Kannur\nDistrict. Petitioner is being prosecuted for the offences\npunishable under Section 420 r/w Section 34 of the Indian\nPenal Code, 1860.\n\n3. According to the prosecution, the accused had collected more\nthan Rs.60,00,000/- from the de facto complainant and other\npersons, promising to provide employment in a Five Star Hotel\nat Malta and thereafter failed to provide the employment and\nreturn the amount, thereby committing the offences alleged.\n\n4. The learned counsel submitted that petitioner has absolutely\nno involvement in the alleged crime and that he is totally\n\nPele shal\nPlR reat\n2024/KER/4267\nCRL.MC 550/2024\n3\n\ninnocent of the allegations. It was further submitted that\npetitioner has been falsely roped into the crime on the mere\nallegation that he had directed the de facto complainant to\nhand over money to the 2™ accused. It was submitted that,\nthe said allegation was false, and there is no proof of any\nnature. It was further submitted that the agreement produced\nherein as Annexure-A4 reveals that the transaction was solely\nbetween the de facto complainant, and the 2\"? accused and the\npetitioner had no connection whatsoever.\n\n5. I have heard the learned Public Prosecutor, who submitted that\nthe allegations by itself indicate the commission of offences\nalleged and therefore the jurisdiction under Section 482 of\nCr.P.C.cannot be invoked. It was further submitted that, from\nthe contentions advanced itself it was evident that the\nallegations in the final report, if admitted, would satisfy the\ningredients of the offences alleged.\n\n6. I have considered the rival contentions.\n\n7. Petitioner is alleged to have directed the de facto complainant\nand other persons to pay Rs.60,00,000/- to the 2™4 accused to\n\n2024/KER/4267\nCRL.MC 550/2024\n4\n\nenable them to obtain employment in a Five Star Hotel at\nMalta. It was contended that there was no such direction and\nthat petitioner had no connection at all with the de facto\ncomplainant. Though allegedly the 2™ accused had issued\ncheques in purported return of the amounts paid by the\ncomplainant, and proceedings under Section 138 of Negotiable\nInstruments Act has already been initiated by the de facto\ncomplainant against the 2\"? accused, I am of the view that\nthose are all matters that can be considered only after trial or\nat least through a discharge petition.\n\n8. Jurisdiction under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. is exceptional in\nnature and can be invoked only when the admitted allegations\ndo not make out any offence or that the proceedings are\ninitiated with mala fides, as held in the decision in State of\nHaryana and others v. Bhajan Lal and others (1992) Suppl. 1\nSCC 335.\n\n9. on a perusal of the nature of allegations, it cannot be held that\nthe admitted allegations would not constitute the offence\nalleged against the petitioner. Therefore, Section 482 of\n\na\nIeee\n2024/KER/4267\nCRL.MC 550/2024\n5\nCr.P.C. cannot be invoked by the petitioner. However, if the\ncircumstances enable the filing of a discharge petition, it is\nopen for the petitioner to approach the jurisdictional Magistrate\nwith such a relief.\nIn that view of the matter, this Crl.M.C.is dismissed.\nsd/-\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\nAMV/19/01/2024\n\nBe aol\nese et ee\na\nBese\n2024/KER/4267\nCRL.MC 550/2024\n6\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 5500/2024\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES\nANNEXURE At THE TRUE COPY OF THE FIS IN CRIME NO.\n315 OF 2019 OF #CHERUPUZHA POLICE\nSTATION KANNUR DISTRICT.\nANNEXURE A2 TRUE COPY OF THE FIR IN CRIME\nNO.315/2019 OF CHERUPUZHA POLICE\nSTATION, KANNUR DISTRICT\nANNEXURE A3 THE TRUE COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT DATED\n06.02.2021\nANNEXURE A4 THE TRUE COPY OF THE AGREEMENT IN NON-\nJUDICIAL STAMP PAPER VALUED’ RS.600/-\nDATED 03.10.2018 EXECUTED BY THE 2ND\nACCUSED INFAVOUR OF THE DEFACTO\nCOMPLAINANT\nANNEXURE A5 THE TRUE COPY OF THE CHEQUE BEARING NO.\n415423 FOR AN AMOUNT OF RS 7,11,000/-\nDRAWN FROM SBI NEDUKANDAM BRANCH DATED\n21.06.2019 TO THE DEFACTO COMPLAINANT\nANNEXURE A6 THE TRUE COPY OF THE CHEQUE BEARING NO.\n415424 FOR AN AMOUNT OF RS 26,00, 000/-\nDRAWN FROM SBI NEDUKANDAM BRANCH DATED\n21.06.2019 TO THE DEFACTO COMPLAINANT\nANNEXURE A7 THE TRUE COPY OF THE COMPLAINT FILED BY\nTHE DEFACTO COMPLAINANT AGAINST THE 2ND\nACCUSED AS STC NO. 1653/2019 BEFORE THE\nJFMC, PAYYANUR\n\n"
