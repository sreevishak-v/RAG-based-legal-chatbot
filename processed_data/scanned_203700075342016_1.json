The crime was registered for offences punishable\nunder Sections 323 and 324 read with Section 34 IPC.\n\n2. On the basis of a complaint that accused on 11/2/2007\nattacked the defacto complainant and her family members crime\nwas registered on 12/2/2007. Annexure Al final report was\nsubmitted only on 8/6/2010. Contending that the final report was\nsubmitted clearly beyond the period of limitation prescribed under\nSection 468 of Cr.P.C. and is liable to be quashed, the petitioners\nhave approached this Court for quashing Annexure Al final report.\nAn application was filed before the court below raising the above\ncontentions which was rejected by the court below by Ext.P1 order.\n\n3. Perusal of the available records, indicate that though FIR\nwas registered on 12/2/2007, after investigation the final report\nwas laid only on 8/6/2010. The learned counsel contended that\nthis was beyond the limitation period as prescribed under Section\n468 Cr.P.C. Learned counsel relied on the decision of the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in Udai Shankar Awasthi v. State of U.P.&\n\n2017/KER/58\n\nCr.MC No.7534/2016 2\n\nAnother {2013 KHC 4025) wherein it was held that law of\nlimitation prescribed under the Cr.P.C. must be observed. But, in\ncertain exceptional circumstances, taking into consideration the\ngravity of the charge, the Court may condone delay, recording\nreasons for the same, in the event that it is found necessary to\ncondone such delay in the interest of justice.\n\n4. The question of limitation was considered by the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in Darsan Singh Saini v. Soham Singh ((2016)\n2 SCC ( Cri.) 418) wherein it was held that limitation under\nSection 468 Cr.P.C.has to be reckoned with reference to the date of\nincident and date of complaint. The Hon'ble Supreme Court relied\non the authoritative pronouncement of the Constitution Bench in\nSarah Mathew v. Institute of Cardio Vascular Diseases ( 2014\n) 2 SCC 62 wherein the Supreme Court held that for the purpose\nof computing limitation under section 468 Cr.P.C., the relevant\ndate is the date of filing the complaint or the date of presentation\nand not the date on which Magistrate took cognizance. Hence, the\ncontention of the learned counsel for the petitioner in this case is\nnot legally sustainable.\n\n5. In the light of the above , I find no illegality, infirmity in the\nfindings of the court below in Ext.P1. Hence, it is liable to be\nconfirmed. I also find no reason to invoke the jurisdiction of this\nCourt under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.to quash the proceedings\nbefore the court below.\n\nBa ala\n\nieee\n\nraphe ee\n\n2017/KER/58\nCr.MC No.7534/2016 3\nIn the result, Cr.M.C.is dismissed.\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS\nJudge\ndpk\n/true copy/ PS to Judge.\n\n"
