In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and Another [(2012)\n10 SCC 303], the Apex Court has held that in appropriate\ncases, the High Court can take note of the amicable resolution\nof disputes between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an\nend to the criminal proceedings. This view was reiterated in\nNarinder Singh and Others v. State of Punjab and Another\n[(2014) 6 SCC 466] and Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State\nof Jharkhand and Another [(2014) 9 SCC 653].\n\n7. I have perused Annexure B affidavit filed by the 2™°\nrespondent. The learned Public Prosecutor has submitted that\nupon verification, it is understood that the affidavit is genuine,\nand the defacto complainant stands by the contents thereof. I\nam satisfied that the matter has been settled and no public\ninterest is involved in this case. There is no impediment for\ngranting the prayer for quashing. The continuance of the\nproceedings will only be an exercise in futility.\n\n8. Accordingly, all proceedings against the petitioner in\nCrime No.1122 of 2023 of Narakkal Police Station, Ernakulam\nare quashed.\n\nThis Crl.M.C is allowed as above.\n\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\nAJM\n\nEU ene\na +2 |\n3 eats\nartes\n2024/KER/6815\nCRL.MC NO. 45 OF 2024\n4\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 45/2024\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES\nAnnexure A CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FIRST\nINFORMATION REPORT IN CRIME NO:\n1122 OF 2023 OF NJARAKKAL POLICE\nSTATION DATED 17-10-2023\nAnnexure -B THE AFFIDAVIT DATED 12-12-2023\nSWORN BY THE 2ND RESPONDENT\nTRUE COPY\n\n"
