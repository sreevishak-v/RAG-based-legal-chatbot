This is a case charge sheeted by the Sub Inspector of Police, Poojappura\nPolice Station in crime No. 314/2016 alleging commission of offences u/s\n294(b), 324, 427 r/w 34 of IPC. Cognizance is not taken for the offence\npunishable u/s 294(b) of IPC.\n\n2. The prosecution case in brief is that the accused due to political rivalry\ntowards CW1 and in furtherance of their common intention, on 26/03/2016 at\n10.30 pm, on the side of the public road from Kundamankadavu towards\nThirumala, shouted obscene words at CW1 and hit on his back with a granite\nstone which was a dangerous weapon. The 1* accused also committed\nmischief by damaging the headlight and side glass of CW1’s Activa Scooter\nthereby causing a loss of %.1500/- to CW1. Thereafter, when CW1 came to\nthe party office at Valiyavila and complained about the incident, both the\naccused abused him with obscene words and the 2\" accused hit CW1 with a\nwooden reaper thereby causing injury on his left arm and shoulder. The\naccused thereby committed the offences as alleged against them.\n\n3. Accused Nos. 1 and 2 appeared on summons and they were furnished with\ncopies of all relevant prosecution records. After hearing, charge for the\noffences u/s 324, 427 r/w 34 of IPC was framed and it was read over and\nexplained to them and they pleaded not guilty.\n\n4. To prove their case, the prosecution examined CW1 as PW1 and marked a\ndocument as Ext.P1. Since the witnesses examined did not support the\nprosecution, CW2 to CW7 were given up by the learned APP. Hence, the\n\n3\nprosecution evidence was closed. As there were no _ incriminating\ncircumstances brought out in evidence against accused, examination u/s 313\nof Cr.P.C was not necessary. The accused did not adduce any evidence.\n\n5. Heard both the sides.\n\n6. The points that arise for consideration are:-\n\n1. Whether the accused had committed the offences punishable u/s 324,\n427 r/w 34 of IPC, as alleged?\n2. What shall be the sentence or order?\n\n7. Point No.1 :- The evidence in this case consists of depositions of 1 witness\nand 1 document from the side of the prosecution. PW1 is the sole injured in\nthis case. He deposed that while he was the Youth Congress General Secretary\nat Vattiyoorkkavu, there was an incident in connection with the writings by\nthe rival Party on the wall booked by them. He affirmed the occurrence and\nadmitted his signature in Ext.P1 FI Statement given to police. However, he\ncategorically deposed that he could not identify the assailants. The names of\nthe accused were stated to police upon hearsay. PW1 also deposed that the\nmatters were settled and he had no further grievances. CW2 who is the brother\nof PW1 is reportedly laid up. Thus, the sole injured in the case turned hostile\nto prosecution. Therefore, the learned Assistant Public Prosecutor gave up the\nremaining witnesses. From the above evidence, there is nothing to prove the\noccurrence as alleged or to connect the accused with the offences. Thus, the\nprosecution failed to prove that the accused committed the offences u/s 324,\n427 r/w 34 of IPC. Point No.1 is found against the prosecution.\n\n8. Point No.2 :- In view of my finding on point no.1, the accused Nos. 1 and 2\n\n4\nare found not guilty of the offences punishable u/s 324, 427 r/w 34 of IPC,\nthey are acquitted u/s 248(1) of Cr.PC and set at liberty, cancelling their bail\nbonds.\nProperty produced in this case as T 236/2016 Item Nos. 1 and 2 stone and\nwooden reaper, being valueless, shall be destroyed.\nDictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected\nand pronounced by me in open Court on this the 28\" day of February 2025.\n¢\nElsa Catherine George\nAdditional Chief Judicial Magistrate\nen ite ONG Thiruvananthapuram\n[S/_geaNe\\\nSs f B/L\nOC)\n\n5\nAPPENDIX\nWitnesses for Prosecution\nPW1 Aneesh\nExhibits for Prosecution\nPl FI Statement dated 27/03/2016 by PW1\nWitnesses and Exhibits for the defence\nNIL\nMaterial Objects\nNIL\n€\nElsa Catherine George,\nAdditional Chief Judicial Magistrate,\nThiruvananthapuram.\nVee\nSy) Gey \\‘e\n= pies Hike\n; i\ne's —_\n\n"
