The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences\npunishable under Sections 296(b), 115(2), 75(1)(i) and 78(1)(i) of the Bharatiya\nNyaya Sanhita.\n\n3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- The defacto\ncomplainant is the owner of a hotel by name ‘Niya Hotel’ and the victim is a\n\nCriminal M.C.No.623/2025 1/5\n\nstaff therein. On 03.01.2025 at about 4.15 p.m., while the victim was washing\nvessels in the back side of the hotel situated near All Saints Mosque Junction in\nKadakampally Village, the accused came from behind and called her by\ntouching her back and offered Rs.500/- to her for going with him, and when she\nrefused, the accused caught hold of her hand and when she made noise, he\nclosed her mouth and kicked on her stomach. When she fell down and again\nmade noise, the accused closed her mouth, and when the defacto complainant\nintervened, the accused uttered abusive words against her and pulled her dress.\nAfter this incident also, the accused followed the victim and caused\ndisturbances to her.\n\nA. Reportedly, the petitioner/accused was arrested on 08.02.2025 and\nhe is in custody since then.\n\n5. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor.\nThe Investigating Officer filed report opposing the bail application.\n\n6. Heard. Perused the records.\n\n7. The only point to be considered is, whether regular bail can be\ngranted to the petitioner/accused.\n\n8. The Point:- The defacto complainant is the employer of the\nvictim. The victim belongs to the State of Assam. The prosecution alleges that,\nthe petitioner/accused touched the back of the victim while she was washing\nvessels, and offered money to her and demanded her to go with him, and when\n\nCriminal M.C.No.623/2025 2/5\n\nshe refused, he assaulted her, and when the defacto complainant intervened, the\naccused assaulted her also.\n\n9. According to the petitioner, he is innocent of the allegations\nlevelled against him and he has been falsely implicated in this case. It is\nsubmitted that, the actual fact is that, the petitioner had gone to the hotel run by\nthe defacto complainant and ordered food, and since the food supplied to him\nhas a foul smell, he informed the same to the staff and to the defacto\ncomplainant, and aggrieved by this, the defacto complainant created a false\nstory and filed a complaint against him before the Valiyhathura Police Station.\nThe petitioner submits that, the Police, after the preliminary enquiry, found that\nthe complaint was false and baseless, and later, the defacto complainant filed a\ncomplaint before the Commissioner of Police, Thiruvananthapuram, and got\nregistered the present case against the petitioner.\n\n10. There is serious allegation as against the petitioner. However, it is\nseen from the report filed by the Investigating Officer that the statement of the\ndefacto complainant and the victim under Section 183(6) of BNSS were\nrecorded, the scene mahazar is prepared, and the treatment certificate is\nobtained. It appears that, the major part of the investigation is over. The\npetitioner/ accused is in judicial custody for a period of 21 days. So even if the\npetitioner is released on bail, there is nothing much, which will adversely affect\nthe investigation. The petitioner/accused is involved in seven other crimes.\n\nCriminal M.C.No.623/2025 3/5\n\nBut, considering the period of detention already undergone by the petitioner\nand the stage of investigation, I am of the view that, the petitioner/accused can\nbe enlarged on bail subject to conditions.\n\nIn the result, the petition is allowed",
