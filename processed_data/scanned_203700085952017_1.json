The prosecution allegation is that on 11.3.2016\nat 12.13 noon, the petitioners herein trespassed into the\nshop run by the third respondent, and standing in the\nname of his wife, by showing a weapon threatened the\nsecond respondent, who was the employee, and had\nstolen three mobile phones and Rs.20,000/- kept in the\ndrawer. Pursuant to the crime registered, investigation\nwas conducted and final report was laid. The matter is\nnow pending before the court.\n\n3. The petitioners contending that the dispute was\na purely personal dispute between the parties and though\nit has been given a serious colour to make it a grave\n\neee)\nBsa\nCri.M.C.No.8595 of 2017 2U1SIRERIS\n2\noffence, the matter has now been settled between the\nparties, has approached this court. It was contended by\nthe learned counsel for the petitioners that the disputes\nwere settled between the parties evidenced by Annexure-\nA3 and 4 affidavits, affirmed by the second and third\nrespondents. The learned counsel for the second and\nthird respondents acknowledged the due execution of the\nabove affidavits in acceptance of the settlement between\nthe parties. The learned Public Prosecutor also submitted\nthat the disputes have been resolved and that the\npetitioners herein have no criminal antecedents. It was\nsubmitted by the learned counsel for the petitioners that\neven though there was an allegation that they had\ncommitted dacoity by show of force, the investigation did\nnot reveal any serious offence. It was pointed out by the\nlearned counsel for the petitioners that though there was\nan allegation that a weapon was used to threaten the\ndefacto complainant, in fact the weapon was_ not\nrecovered. Hence the ingredients of the offence to that\nextent will not lie. It was further contended by the\n\neee)\n\nBsa\nCri.M.C.No.8595 of 2017 2U1SIRERIS\nlearned counsel that the amount allegedly taken from the\ndrawer had also not been recovered. Hence there is no\nmaterial to substantiate that part of the allegation.\nHence it was contended by the learned counsel for the\npetitioners that at the most the allegation may confine to\nstealing of two mobile phones. It was submitted by the\nlearned counsel that it was only a dispute between the\nparties relating to the purchase of mobile phones.\nConsidering the above facts and also the fact that the\npetitioners are not involved in any other case and in the\nlight of the settlement reported by the parties, I feel that\nno purpose will be served by prosecuting the petitioners\nherein. Accordingly, a quietus is liable to be given to the\nentire prosecution.\n\n5. Hence the Crl.M.C is allowed quashing all\nfurther proceedings in CP.NO.69/2016 on the files of the\nJudicial First Class magistrate Court-I, Irinjalakuda arising\nfrom Crime No.528/2016 of Irinjalakuda Police Station.\n\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE\n\nR.AV\n\n"
