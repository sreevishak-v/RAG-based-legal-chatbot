REPRESENTED BY MOTHER SUJA, PIN -\n680505\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n12.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\n2024/KER/2545\nCRL.MC NO.340 OF 2024\n3\nORDER\nDated this the 12\" day of January , 2024\n\nThis Crl.M.C., under Section 482 of Cr.P.C., is at the\ninstance of the respondent in M.C.No.149 of 2022 on the\nfile of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Chavakkad,\nimpugning the order dated 02.09.2023 in Crl.M.P.No.3728\nof 2023.\n2. Learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that\nhis wife and children filed M.C.No.149 of 2022 against him,\nunder Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act,\n2005, (hereinafter referred as the D.V.Act) and obtained\nAnnexure A3 order, in which he was restrained from\ncommitting domestic violence against them, and from\ndispossessing them from the - scheduled property.\nSubsequently, his wife and children filed Annexure A4\nviolation petition against him, alleging that on 18.05.2023,\nhe abused and threatened them in violation of Annexure\nA3 protection order. Learned Magistrate as per Annexure\n\nENSANre\n2024/KER/2545\nCRL.MC NO.340 OF 2024\n\nA5 order, took cognizance under Section 31 of the D.V. Act,\nand S.T.No.2670 of 2023 was taken on file against him,\nand he is challenging that order.\n\n3. On going through Annexure A5 order dated\n02.09.2023, it could be seen that, after hearing the\npetitioners in Crl.M.P.No.3728 of 2023, and on perusing the\nreport of the Protection Officer, learned Magistrate was\nsatisfied that sufficient grounds were there to proceed\nagainst the respondent/husband under Section 31 of the\nD.V. Act, and so, S.T.No.2670 of 2023 was taken on file\nagainst him.\n\n4. The petitioner herein, is having every right and\nopportunity to defend his case in S.T.No.2670 of 2023 by\nadducing evidence. Without taking such a course, his\nprayer is to quash Annexure A5 order, even before the\nparties could venture into prove or disprove their\nallegations and counter allegations. On receipt of\nAnnexure A4 violation petition, the petitioners therein were\n\nBees\n2024/KER/2545\nCRL.MC NO.340 OF 2024\n5\n\nheard, and the report of the Protection Officer was verified,\nand on prima facie satisfaction of violation of the protection\norder, learned Magistrate took cognizance under Section 31\nof the D.V. Act and, S.T.No.2670 of 2023 was taken on file\nagainst him. This Court finds no illegality or impropriety in\nthe impugned order and hence the Crl.M.C. is liable to be\ndismissed.\n\nIn the result, this Crl.M.C. is dismissed and the learned\nMagistrate is directed to dispose S.T.No.2670 of 2023 as\nearly as possible, at any rate, within a period of two\nmonths from today, on affording opportunity to both\nparties to adduce their evidence, if any.\n\nSd/-\nSOPHY THOMAS\nJUDGE\nSSK/12/01\n\nRs fe]\n[eieanceey\n2024/KER/2545\nCRL.MC NO.340 OF 2024\n6\n\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 340/2024\n\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES\n\nAnnexure Al A TRUE COPY OF THE MC 149/2022 DATED\n21.12.2022 BEFORE THE JUDICIAL FIRST CLASS\nMAGISTRATE, CHAVAKKAD\n\nAnnexure A2 A TRUE COPY OF THE CRL.MP NO. 4188/2022\nDATED 21.12.2022 BEFORE THE JUDICIAL FIRST\nCLASS MAGISTRATE, CHAVAKKAD\n\nAnnexure A3 A TRUE COPY OF THE INTERIM ORDER ON\n22.12.2022 IN CRL.MP NO. 4188/2022\nJUDICIAL FIRST CLASS MAGISTRATE, CHAVAKKAD\n\nAnnexure A4 A.
