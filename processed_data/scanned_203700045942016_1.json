TO JUDGE\nbp\n\nbine\n2018/KER/489\nB. KEMAL PASHA, J.\nDated this the 5\" day of January, 2018\nORDER\n\nPetitioners are accused Nos.i1 and 2 _ in\nC.C.No.781/2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court,\nKayamkulam, based on Annexure-A3 final report in Crime\nNo.960/2012 of the Kayamkulam Police Station for the\noffences under Section 420 read with 34 IPC. The allegation\nagainst the 1* petitioner is that she had offered to sell a petrol\nbunk, being conducted by her in a property, by claiming that\nshe has every right over the property to convey, through\nAnnexure-Al agreement. In Annexure-Al agreement she has\nagreed that she would make all the title holders of the property\nalso as party to the sale deed.\n\n2. According to the petitioners, who are the\naccused Nos.i and 2, they have every right to convey the\nproperty. The defacto complainant and his wife have been\nimpleaded in the Crl.M.C. as additional respondents 2 and 3.\nThe learned counsel for the said respondents submits that the\ndefacto complainant has been deliberately cheated through\n\nbine\n2018/KER/489\nCri.M.C.No.4594 of 2016 2\nAnnexure-Al agreement and the money has not been so far\nreturned. It has been argued that the petitioners have no\nright to convey the property.\n\n3. The present arguments forwarded by the learned\ncounsel for the petitioners cannot be considered by this Court\nat this stage. Those matters have to be decided by the court\nbelow at appropriate stage.\n\nWith liberty to the petitioners to take up all these\ncontentions before the court below at the stage of framing\ncharges under Section 239 Cr.P.C., this Crl.M.C. is disposed of.\n\nIf the stage of Section 239 Cr.P.C. is over, the petitioners may\ntake up all these contentions during trial.\nSd/-\nB. KEMAL PASHA, JUDGE.\nne // True Copy // P.A. to Judge\n\n"
