The complainant's case in brief is as follows:- That at around\n08.30 hours on 14.03.2024, the Ist accused dishonestly taken away the\nrailway properties i.e., 21 numbers of railway pandrol clips valued\nRs.2100/- and the 2nd accused dishonestly taken away 82 numbers of\npandrol clips valued Rs.8200/- from the Railway Material stockyard near\nKillippalam. Thereby the accused committed the offence punishable\nunder section 3(a) of the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act,\n1966.\n3. The accused were arrested and produced before the court.\nThey were remanded to the judicial custody. Subsequently they were\nenlarged on bail.\n\n3\n\n4. Cognizance was taken for the offence punishable under\nsection 3(a) of the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966 on\nthe basis of the complaint filed by the Inspector of Railway Protection\nForce, Thiruvananthapuram Central. Summons was served on the\naccused. They appeared before the court. The 2nd accused filed an\napplication expressing her readiness to plead guilty, even before recording\nthe pre-charge evidence. The complaint and the records annexed to it were\nperused. I am satisfied that there are materials to frame charge for the\noffence punishable under section 3(a) of the Railway Property (Unlawful\nPossession) Act, 1966. Hence the charge for the offence punishable under\nsection 3(a) of Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966 Act\nwas framed, read over and explained to the 2nd accused in Malayalam, to\nwhich the 2nd accused pleaded guilty.\n\n5. lam satisfied that the 2nd accused pleaded guilty voluntarily,\nfully knowing the consequences of pleading guilty. Therefore the plea of\nguilt is accepted. The 2nd accused is found guilty of the offence\npunishable under section 3(a) of the Railway Property (Unlawful\nPossession) Act, 1966 and hence she is convicted thereunder. Having\nregard to the facts and circumstance of the case, I am of the view that this\nis not a fit case to invoke the benevolent provisions of the Probation of\nOffenders Act.\n\n(Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected\nand pronounced by me in open court on this the 04\" day of March, 2025)\n\nSd/-\n\nChief Judicial Magistrate\n\nThiruvananthapuram\n\n6. Heard the 2nd accused regarding the question of sentence.\nShe pleaded for leniency. The accused has no criminal antecedents. The\naccused had already undergone custody for a period of 5 days. Even the\n\nA\nprosecution has no case that there was any premeditated intention on the\npart of the accused in the commission of the offence. Having regard to\nthe nature of offence and the value of the property involved and the age\nof the accused, I am of the view that imprisonment for not less than one\nyear is not warranted in this case.\n\nIn the result, the 2nd accused is convicted and sentenced under\nsection 269(3) of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 to\nundergo simple imprisonment for 5 days and to pay fine of Rs.2000/-\n(two thousand rupees) for the offence punishable under section 3(a) of\nthe Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966. In default of\npayment of fine the accused shall undergo simple imprisonment for 5\ndays. Set off is allowed under section 297 of the Bharatiya Nagarik\nSuraksha Sanhita, 2023 for the period of detention already undergone by\nthe 2nd accused in judicial custody, i.e., from 15/03/2024 to 19/03/2024.\nThe case against the 1st accused is refiled as CC No.536/2024.\n\n(Pronounced by me in open court on this the 04th day of March, 2025)\nSd/-\nChief Judicial Magistrate\nThiruvananthapuram\nAPPENDIX\nNIL\nSd/-\nChief Judicial Magistrate\nThiruvananthapuram\n(True copy)\nChief Judicial Magistrate\nThiruvananthapuram\n\n"
