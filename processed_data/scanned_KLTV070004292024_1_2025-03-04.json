The complainant's case in brief is as follows:- That at around\n09.00 hours on 30.10.2023, the accused dishonestly taken away the\nrailway properties i.e., 04 numbers of railway bolt with nut of ‘C’ clamp\neach valued Rs.205/- (Total Rs.820/-) and 07 numbers of railway bolt\nwith nut of ‘C’ clamp each valued Rs.205/- (total Rs.1435/-) and one\npiece of railway 60 kg rail having length of 32 cm, valued Rs.500/- and 5\nnumbers of railway bolt with nut of ‘C’ clamp valued Rs.1025/- from the\nRailway Gang Rest Room, Dhanuvechapuram Railway Station, over KM\n243/ 500-600. Thereby the accused committed the offence punishable\nunder section 3(a) of the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act,\n\n1966.\n\n3\n\n3. On 31.10.2023, the accused were arrested and produced\nbefore the court. They were remanded to the judicial custody.\nSubsequently they were enlarged on bail.\n\n4. Cognizance was taken for the offence punishable under\nsection 3(a) of the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966 on\nthe basis of the complaint filed by the Inspector of the Railway\nProtection Force, Thiruvananthapuram Central. Summons was served on\nthe accused. The accused appeared before the court. The 1st accused\nfiled application expressing his readiness to plead guilty, even before\nrecording the pre-charge evidence. The complaint and the records\nannexed to it were perused. I am satisfied that there are materials to frame\ncharge under section 3(a) of the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession)\nAct, 1966. Hence the charge for the offence punishable under section 3(a)\nof Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966 Act was framed,\nread over and explained to the 1st accused in Malayalam, to which the 1st\naccused pleaded guilty.\n\n5. Iam satisfied that the 1st accused pleaded guilty voluntarily,\nfully knowing the consequences of pleading guilty. Therefore the plea of\nguilt is accepted. The ist accused is found guilty of the offence\npunishable under section 3(a) of the Railway Property (Unlawful\nPossession) Act, 1966 and hence he is convicted thereunder. Having\nregard to the facts and circumstance of the case, I am of the view that this\nis not a fit case to invoke the benevolent provisions of the Probation of\nOffenders Act.\n\n(Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected\nand pronounced by me in open court on this the 04\" day of March, 2025)\n\nSd/-\n\nChief Judicial Magistrate\n\nThiruvananthapuram\n\n4\n\n6. Heard the 1st accused regarding the question of sentence. He\npleaded for leniency. He has no criminal antecedents. The accused had\nalready undergone custody for a period of 5 days. Even the prosecution\nhas no case that there was any premeditated intention on the part of the\naccused in the commission of the offence. Having regard to the nature\nof offence and the value of the property involved and the age of the\naccused, I am of the view that imprisonment for not less than one year is\nnot warranted in this case.\n\nIn the result, the 1st accused is convicted and sentenced under\nsection 269(3) of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 to\nundergo simple imprisonment for 5 days and to pay fine of Rs.2000/-\n(two thousand rupees) for the offence punishable under section 3(a) of\nthe Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966. In default of\npayment of fine the accused shall undergo simple imprisonment for 5\ndays. Set off is allowed under section 297 of the Bharatiya Nagarik\nSuraksha Sanhita, 2023 for the period of detention already undergone by\nthe 1st accused in judicial custody, i.e from 31/10/2023 to 04/11/2023.\nThe case against the 2nd accused is refiled as CC No.535/2024.\n\n(Pronounced by me in open court on this the 04th day of March, 2025)\n\nSd/-\nChief Judicial Magistrate\nThiruvananthapuram\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nNIL\nSd/-\nChief Judicial Magistrate\nThiruvananthapuram\n(True copy)\n\nChief Judicial Magistrate\nThiruvananthapuram\n\n"
