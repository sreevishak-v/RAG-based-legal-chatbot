The aforesaid case had arisen from\nCrime No. 346 of 2002 of Perinthalmanna Police Station\nregistered alleging offences punishable under Sections\n143, 147, 148, 447, 341, 323, 324, 307 read with\nSec.149 of the Indian Penal Code.\n\n2. After investigation, the final report was laid\nbefore the jurisdictional Magistrate against the petitioners\nand 21 others. The petitioners were the accused Nos. 4\nand 15 in the final report. The petitioners were not\navailable for committal and the case against others were\ncommitted before the Court of Sessions. The trial was\nproceeded with against the aforesaid case and as per\nAnnexure-B judgment dated 24.03.2007, all the other\naccused except the petitioners and accused No.3 were\nacquitted under Section 232 of the Code of Criminal\n\neee\n2016/KER/33668\n\nCrl.M.C.No. 4678 of 2016 ;\n\nProcedure. Thereafter, the 3 accused surrendered before\nthe learned Sessions Judge and the case against him was\nproceeded with in S.C No. 42 of 2008 and by Annexure-C\njudgment dated 17.04.2008, he was also found not guilty\nof the offences alleged against him and was liable to be\nacquitted.\n\n3. The learned counsel appearing for the\npetitioners submits that in view of Annexure B and C\njudgments of the learned Sessions Judge, the substratum\nof case against the petitioners have been shattered. I\nhave bestowed my _-— anxious’- considerations and\nsubmissions and have perused Annexures B and C\njudgments of the learned Sessions Judge. From para\nNo.7 of Annexure-B judgment, it is discernible that the\npresence of some of the material witnesses could not be\nsecured in spite of initiating coercive steps. PWs 1 to 4\ndid not support the prosecution case. Annexure-C\njudgment also tells the same story.\n\neee\n2016/KER/33668\nCrl.M.C.No. 4678 of 2016 3\n\n4. In Moosa v. Sub Inspector of Police (2006\n(1) KLT 552) a Full Bench of this Court had occasion to\nhold that though the judgment rendered in the case of a\nco-accused and the reasoning of the judgment contained\ntherein or appreciation of the evidence therein are not\nmatters to be taken into account for the purpose of\ngranting any relief to quash the proceedings and thus bar\nthe trial itself, a case wherein the very substratum of the\ncase is lost may be an exception to this rule. The same\nview was followed in the precedents cited supra.\n\n5. I am of the firm view that no purpose is going to\nbe served by directing the petitioners to face the trial at\nthis stage. It can only be a futile exercise and the only\npurpose that will be served is to gnaw into precious time\nduring which more productive work can be done by the\ncourt below. The prospects of conviction is extremely\nremote owing to the acquittal of the co accused.\n\nIn the result this petition is allowed and all\nfurther proceedings against the petitioners in C.P No.42\n\neae\napie\n2016/KER/33668\nCrl.M.C.No. 4678 of 2016\n4\nof 2003 on the files of the Judicial Magistrate of 1* Class-\nI,perinthalmanna, which has arisen from Crime No. 346 of\n2002 of Perinthalmanna Police Station shall stand\nquashed",
