THE EXCISE INSPECTOR\nADOOR RANGE, 689101.\nBY THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR SMT. M.T. SHEEBA\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 24-04-\n2015, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\nWw\n\n2015/KER/17322\nK.RAMAKRISHNAN, J\n‘Dated this the 24\" day of April 2015.\nORDER\n\nThis is an application filed by the petitioner, who is the\naccused in C.P.No.38/2015 of Judicial First Class Magistrate's\nCourt, Adoor for issuing a direction to the learned Magistrate,\nunder Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter\ncalled the Code).\n\n2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioner is the sole\naccused in O.R. No.169 of 2013 of Excise Range Adoor and she\nwas charge sheeted alleging offence under Section 55(1) of the\nAbkari Act, on the allegation that on 10.8.2013 the second\nrespondent alleged to have found her selling foreign liquor and on\nseeing the excise party she ran away from the place. The police\n\nDi\npees fe\n2015/KER/17322\nCri.M.C.2547/2015 2\nparty have not arrested her. It appears that final report has been\nfiled and now it is pending as C.P.No.38/2015 before the Judicial\nFirst Class Magistrate's Court, Adoor. The petitioner apprehends\nthat if she surrenders before the court below, she is likely to be\nremanded and the application for bail will not be considered. So\nthe petitioner has no other remedy except to approach this court\nseeking the following relief:\n“For these and other grounds urged at the time of hearing it\nis prayed that this honourable court may be kind enough to direct\nthe learned Judicial First Class Magistrate Adoor, Pathanamthitta\nto consider and pass orders on the bail application of the\npetitioner on the date of surrender itself.”\n\n3. Considering the nature of relief sought in the petition, this\ncourt felt that this petition can be disposed of today itself, after\nhearing the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned\nPublic Prosecutor.\n\n4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that if the\n\n2015/KER/17322\nCrl.M.C.2547/2015 3\npetitioner surrenders before the court below, the court below will\nnot consider the bail application and she will be remanded to\ncustody and unless a direction is given from this court, her bail\napplication will not be considered on the same day itself.\n\n5. The application is opposed by the learned Public\nProsecutor.\n\n6. Itis an admitted fact that the petitioner has been arrayed as\nan accused in O.R. No.169/2013 of Excise Range, Adoor, which is\nnow pending as C.P. No.38/2015 on the files of Judicial First Class\nMagistrate's Court, Adoor. The apprehension of the petitioner\nthat if she surrenders before the court below and moves for bail her\nbail application will not be considered and she will be remanded to\ncustody is, without any basis, as this court has in several matters\nof this nature expressly observed that the Presiding Officers of the\nCriminal courts are duty bound to consider and dispose of the bail\napplications as far as possible on the date of application itself on\n\nBee\n2015/KER/17322\nCrl.M.C.2547/2015 4\ntheir surrender. So, there is no necessity to issue any direction, as\nsuch, as claimed in the petition. However, considering the\napprehension raised in the petition, this court feels that this petition\ncan be disposed of as follows.\n\nIf the petitioner surrenders before the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate's Court, Adoor and moves for bail in C.P. No.38 of\n2015 (O.R. No.169 of 2013 of Excise Range, Adoor), the learned\nMagistrate is directed to consider and dispose of the bail\napplication as far as possible, on the date of application itself after\nhearing the Assistant Public Prosecutor in charge of the case, in\naccordance with law.\n\nWith the said observations and directions, this Crl.M.C. is\ndisposed of.\n\nSd/-\nK.RAMAKRISHNAN, J,\nJUDGE\ndl\n\n"
