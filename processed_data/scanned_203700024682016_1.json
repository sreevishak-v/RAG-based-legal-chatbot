It was held that certain\ncategories of cases involving heinous and serious offences of\nmental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc.\ncannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim or\nvictim's family and the offender have settled the dispute as\nthose offences are not private in nature and have serious\nimpact on society. But those cases where the wrong is\nbasically private or personnel in nature and those in which\nthe parties have resolved their entire dispute could fittingly\nbe quashed by this Court taking into account the\ncompromise between the offender and victim. In such cases\nthe possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and\ncontinuation of criminal case would put accused and the de\nfacto complainant to great oppression and prejudice.\n\nBp eah\n2016/KER/24154\nCrl.M.C. No.2468 of 2016 -5-\n\n11. After having anxiously considered the submissions\nit is felt that it would be unfair and contrary to the interest\nof justice to continue with the criminal proceeding. It would\nonly tantamount to abuse of process of law to subject the\nparties to the ordeal of a protracted criminal proceeding\ndespite the settlement and compromise between the victim\nand wrongdoer. Settlement will augur well for the interest\nof the community and will enable the parties to live in peace\nand harmony.\n\nIn the result, this petition is allowed and all further\nproceedings against the petitioner herein in S.C.No.274 of\n2015 on the files of the Additional Sessions Judge-I (Fast\nTrack Court-I, Manjeri shall stand quashed.\n\nSd/-\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.Y.,\nJUDGE\nkp/-6.6.16\n\n"
