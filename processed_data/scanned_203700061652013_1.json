Annexure Az is\nnothing but a final report laid by the Additional Sub Inspector of\nYerroor Police Station against the petitioner herein after concluding\nthe investigation in Crime No.699/2012, chargesheeting him for the\noffences punishable under Section 55(a) and (i) of the Abkari Act (for\nshort 'the Act’).\n\n2. The case of the prosecution was as follows:-\n\nOn 6.9.2012 while conducting patrol duty, the S.I. of Police\nand party got a reliable information that a person was transporting\nIndian Made Foreign Liquor in a scooter to a place called Manalil in\nAyiranallore Village and when they reached the spot, a four wheeler\nscooter was found proceeding to the place and the same was\nintercepted. The vehicle was stopped by its rider. On verification of\nthe scooter, three bottles each of capacity 500ml. containing Indian\n\n2017/KER/49769\n\nCrl.M.C.6165 of 2013 ;\nMade Foreign Liquor was found kept therein in a plastic cover.\nOn questioning, the officials were told by the person that the\nliquor was purchased by him from the outlet of Beverages\nCorporation at Yerroor and transported for sale in retail. The\nliquor along with the scooter were seized. The whereabouts of\nthe person were collected and he was arrested. The accused\nalong with the articles were taken to the Police Station and Crime\nNo.699/2012 was registered for the offences punishable under\nSection 55(a) and 55(i) of the Act, true copy of which is appended\nto this petition as Annexure A1.\n\n3. Based on the FIR, the investigation was conducted.\nThe same was concluded and on 1.11.2012, a final report was laid\nbefore the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Punalur, the\ntrue copy of which is appended to this petition as Annexure A2.\nThe final report was taken on file by the Additional Court of\nSessions, Kottarakkara as $.C.No.451/2013. At that juncture, this\nCourt was approached by the petitioner under Section 482 Cr.P.C.\n\n2017/KER/49769\nCrl.M.C.6165 of 2013 ;\nseeking to quash Annexure Az and all further proceedings\ninitiated pursuant to that.\n\n4. SriA.Rajasimhan, the learned counsel has drawn my\nattention to Annexure A2 to contend that, the contraband liquor\nallegedly transported by the petitioner is IMFL and the quantity\nis 1.5 litres. According to him, as per Section 10 of the Act, the\nGovernment is authorised to prescribe, from time to time, the\nquantity of liquor or intoxicating drug, which shall be transported\nby a person without a permit issued under the provisions of the\nAct, either generally for the whole State or for any local area.\nAccording to him, S.R.O.No.127/99 published in the Official\nGazette as G.O.(P) 22/99/TD dated 05.02.2009 is such a\nnotification issued by the Government in exercise of the power\nunder Section 10 of the Act and it permits a person to transport\nor possess IMFL of quantity 3 litres without a permit or licence\nbeing possessed by him. The counsel urged that in the case on\nhand, the petitioner was allegedly transporting 1.5 litres of IMFL,\n\nBl\niz ars\nforesee\nBlokes\n2017/KER/49769\nCrl.M.C.6165 of 2013\n:~4-:\nwhich is less than 3 litres, being the maximum quantity which a\nperson is authorised to transport without the authority of permit\nor licence, the prosecution proceedings initiated against him will\nnot sustain. According to him, an allegation that the contraband\nliquor was transported by the petitioner for sale is also raised in\nAnnexure A2 without being supported by any materials in that\nregard. Advancing arguments of the nature, the learned counsel\ncanvassed for quashing Annexure A2 and all further proceedings\ninitiated pursuant to that.\n5. Section 10 of the Act being relevant in the context on\nhand is extracted hereunder:-\n“to. Transporting of liquor or intoxicating\ndrug.- No liquor or intoxicating drug, exceeding\nsuch quantity as the Government may, from time\nto time, prescribe by notification in the Gazette\neither generally for the whole State or for any\nlocal area, shall be transported except under a\npermit issued under the provisions of the next\nfollowing section.”\n6. Section 10 authorises the Government to issue\nNotification in the Official Gazette either generally for the whole\n\n2017/KER/49769\nCrl.M.C.6165 of 2013 ;\nState or for any local area specifying the limit of liquor or\nintoxicating drug which a person could transport without a\npermit in that regard.\n\n7. The Government as per G.O(P)No.29/98/TD dated\n5.3.1998 published as S.R.O.No.228/98 in the Kerala Gazette\nExtraordinary has enhanced the quantity of the Indian Made\nForeign Liquor that can be possessed and transported without\npermit to 4.5 litres. In view of the large scale misuse of this\nfacility, the Government has decided to reduce the quantity of\nIndian Made Foreign Liquor other than beer, wine and foreign\nmade foreign liquor that can be possessed and transported\nwithout permit to 1.5 litres and accordingly, Notification\nS.R.O.No.127/99 was issued by the Government in exercise of the\npower conferred under Sections 10 and 13 of the Act, which\nreads:-\n\npeeaEwte\n2017/KER/49769\nCrl.M.C.6165 of 2013\n:-6-:\n“GOVERNMENT OF KERALA\nTAXES (G) Department\nNOTIFICATIONS\n]\nG.O.(P) No.22/99/TD.

Dated, Thiruvananthapuram,2™ August,2003.\nS.R.O.No.725/2003.--In exercise of the powers conferred by section 10 and 13 of\nthe Abkari Act,1 of 1077, the Government of Kerala hereby make the following amendment\nto the Notification issued under G.O(P) No.22/99/TD. dated 5\" February,1999 and\npublished as S.R.0.127/99 in the Kerala Gazette Extraordinary No.250 dated 5\"\nFebruary,1999 namely:-\nAMENDMENT\nIn the table to the said Notification.--\n(1) for the entries in column (2) against serial numbers 2,3 and 4, the entries, “3\nlitres”, “7.8 litres” and “7.8 litres” shall, respectively, be substituted;\n(2) The proviso shall be omitted.\nBy order of the Governor,\nSAJEN PETER,\nSecretary to Government”\nAs per S.R.O.No.127/99, the limit of IMFL permitted by the\nGovernment to be possessed or transported by a person is 1.5\nlitres. The quantum of 1.5 litres has been substituted with 3 litres\nby way of amendment introduced by S.R.O.No.725/2003 with\n\neee\n\nos aah\n\nBlea\n\n2017/KER/49769\nCrl.M.C.6165 of 2013\n~8-!\n\neffect from 2.8.2003. Therefore, the position stands as on date is\nthat a person is legally entitled to possess or transport 3 litres of\nIMFL without holding a licence or permit.\n\ng. The allegation of the prosecution has to be viewed in the\nsaid legal backdrop and the material part of Annexure A2 is\nreproduced hereunder:-\n\n“oles  GeAlMalngo  DensososMaamMjss ®9eQvoew@mMosjo\n\nAHOMOEAIOS}o JS] AGIWOW OoalMUMdEM AN GRWIH00 al\n\n(O6S3BEBO MUIGIWOOOM® 06.09.2012 18.25 m@emMlwas) BHOlOMANS\n\nAfeaeieds acmaieds ayoloied M.G.L.P miejslicva'lalo 2clé\n\nANAIONGS GeZdEM}o ADQo Moadvieajom alisiad lees AICyJo\n\nCEOIOIA A OMYS ahEWIS@OHIN OMLO} BOIWMo MAM Gade\n\nAASlay alseaatwMes @dNo0 alee eoocwles [aol KL-\n\n25A/873300mm18 = mMe)g01e 5O00Mlafi@sc aaoggym 3\n\n&jofaslaiool 1 aloo’ 500M! soriavjod mga alesvoasso\n\nalain AN@aINAOIO HSOMOAINBJUM....-\n\n10. As per the allegation, based on a reliable information\nthat a person is transporting IMFL for sale in a scooter towards\nManalil area without any authority and against the provisions of\nthe Act that the ASI of Police, Yerroor Police Station along with\n\nbeeen\n2017/KER/49769\nCrl.M.C.6165 of 2013\n:~9-:\n\nhis associates proceeded to the spot. According to them, they\nfound the petitioner there and identified him as the man\ndescribed by the informant, intercepted the scooter ridden by\nhim, conducted examination of the scooter and detected the\ncontraband. It is further alleged that the petitioner on their query\ntold them that the contraband liquor was bought from Beverages\nCorporation outlet at Yerroor and is being transported for sale.\nThe further allegation was that since the petitioner was found\ntransporting the liquor without any authority to do so, he was\narrested, the contraband was seized and Crime No.699/2012 was\nregistered. The said crime was investigated and culminated in the\nlaying of Annexure A2.\n\n11. The allegations when scrutinised, this Court could see\nsubstance in the arguments advanced by the learned counsel.\nFirstly, the allegation as it stands on the day discloses the\ncontraband as IMFL. Secondly, the quantum allegedly\ntransported is 1.5 litres. Thirdly, the contraband liquor was\n\nbeeen\n2017/KER/49769\nCrl.M.C.6165 of 2013\n:-10-:\nallegedly meant for sale. Fourthly, the contraband was allegedly\ntransported without any documents of authorisation.\n\n12. Therefore, it is revealed from the allegations that the\npetitioner was transporting 1.5 litres of IMFL in his scooter\nwithout authorisation. SRO No.127/99, the Notification issued by\nthe Government in exercise of the power conferred on it under\nSection 10 of the Act, as amended by SRO No.725/03, a\nNotification issued later, shows the maximum limit of IMFL, a\nperson can possess or transport without licence or permit is 3\nlitres. As per the Notification, permit or licence is not required\nfor possessing or transporting IMFL upto the quantity of 3 litres.\nThe petitioner in the case on hand was carrying 1.5 litres of IMFL\nwhich comes within the quantity permitted by the Government to\npossess or transport without authority.\n\n13. An allegation was also raised in Annexure Az by the\nprosecution that the IMFL was transported by the petitioner for\nsale and on its basis, the offences under Sections 55(a) and 55(i) of\n\neee\niz ars\neal ee\nBlSReo\n2017/KER/49769\nCrl.M.C.6165 of 2013\n-11-:\nthe Act were incorporated therein. Therefore it is relevant to\nnote, what are the materials available for the prosecution to base\nits allegation of sale against the petitioner. Before adverting to\nthe basis for raising the allegation of sale, it is apposite to extract\nSection 55 of the Act hereunder:-\n“55. For illegal import, etc.-Whoever in\ncontravention of this Act or of any rule or order\nmade under this Act\n(a) imports, exports, transports, transits or\npossesses liquor or any intoxicating drug; or\nXXXXXAKX\n“(i) sells or stores for sale liquor or any intoxicating drug;\nshall be punishable\n(1) for any offence, other than an offence falling clause (d) or\nclause (e), with imprisonment for a term which may extend to\nten years and with fine which shall not be less than rupees one\nlakh, and\n(2) xxxxx\nExplanation: For the purpose of this section and section 64A,\n“intoxicating drug” means any intoxicating substance other than a\nnarcotic drug or psyshoctropic substance regulated by the Narcotic Drugs\nand Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (Central Act 61 of 1985) , which\nthe Central Government by Notification declare to be an intoxicating\ndrug.”\n14. In the case on hand, the basis firstly for the prosecution\nto allege sale is the hear say information that a person is\ntransporting liquor for sale, which according to the prosecution,\n\nbeeen\n2017/KER/49769\nCrl.M.C.6165 of 2013\n:-12-:\n\nis a reliable one. The basis secondly was the information given by\n\nthe accused himself while questioning that the liquor was\ntransported for sale. The basis thirdly was the bona fide belief of\n\nthe officer, who seized it. It is pertinent to note that an allegation\n\nof sale is difficult to sustain on the three grounds as projected\nabove.\n\n15. In order to charge the petitioner with an offence under\nSection 55 (a) or (i) of the Act, the prosecution must establish\nthat he is engaged in importing, exporting, transporting,\ntransiting, possessing, or selling or storing liquor or intoxicating\ndrug in contravention of the provisions of the Act or any rule or\nany order made under the Act. As per the Act, in order to be\nengaged in any of the acts aforesaid, valid documents conferring\nauthority are required. Therefore, the prosecution has also to\nestablish that the petitioner was engaged in activities of the above\nnature without any authority. As per SROs. aforementioned, for\ntransporting IMFL upto 3 litres, a permit is not required.\n\nional\neae\nBlokes\n2017/KER/49769\nCrl.M.C.6165 of 2013\n:+13-:\nTherefore, the petitioner cannot be found fault with as per the\nprovisions of the Act for transporting 1.5 litres of spirit without\nany authority. For the very reason, he cannot also be found fault\nwith under sub-sections (a) and (i) Section 55 of the Act.\nTherefore, the allegations against the petitioner as per Annexure\nA2 will not sustain and Annexure A2 and further proceedings\ninitiated pursuant to that are liable to be quashed",

Advancing arguments of the nature, the learned counsel\ncanvassed for quashing Annexure A2 and all further proceedings\ninitiated pursuant to that.\n5. Section 10 of the Act being relevant in the context on\nhand is extracted hereunder:-\n“to.

As per the allegation, based on a reliable information\nthat a person is transporting IMFL for sale in a scooter towards\nManalil area without any authority and against the provisions of\nthe Act that the ASI of Police, Yerroor Police Station along with\n\nbeeen\n2017/KER/49769\nCrl.M.C.6165 of 2013\n:~9-:\n\nhis associates proceeded to the spot. According to them, they\nfound the petitioner there and identified him as the man\ndescribed by the informant, intercepted the scooter ridden by\nhim, conducted examination of the scooter and detected the\ncontraband. It is further alleged that the petitioner on their query\ntold them that the contraband liquor was bought from Beverages\nCorporation outlet at Yerroor and is being transported for sale.\nThe further allegation was that since the petitioner was found\ntransporting the liquor without any authority to do so, he was\narrested, the contraband was seized and Crime No.699/2012 was\nregistered. The said crime was investigated and culminated in the\nlaying of Annexure A2.\n\n11. The allegations when scrutinised, this Court could see\nsubstance in the arguments advanced by the learned counsel.\nFirstly, the allegation as it stands on the day discloses the\ncontraband as IMFL. Secondly, the quantum allegedly\ntransported is 1.5 litres. Thirdly, the contraband liquor was\n\nbeeen\n2017/KER/49769\nCrl.M.C.6165 of 2013\n:-10-:\nallegedly meant for sale. Fourthly, the contraband was allegedly\ntransported without any documents of authorisation.\n\n12. Therefore, it is revealed from the allegations that the\npetitioner was transporting 1.5 litres of IMFL in his scooter\nwithout authorisation. SRO No.127/99, the Notification issued by\nthe Government in exercise of the power conferred on it under\nSection 10 of the Act, as amended by SRO No.725/03, a\nNotification issued later, shows the maximum limit of IMFL, a\nperson can possess or transport without licence or permit is 3\nlitres. As per the Notification, permit or licence is not required\nfor possessing or transporting IMFL upto the quantity of 3 litres.\nThe petitioner in the case on hand was carrying 1.5 litres of IMFL\nwhich comes within the quantity permitted by the Government to\npossess or transport without authority.\n\n13. An allegation was also raised in Annexure Az by the\nprosecution that the IMFL was transported by the petitioner for\nsale and on its basis, the offences under Sections 55(a) and 55(i) of\n\neee\niz ars\neal ee\nBlSReo\n2017/KER/49769\nCrl.M.C.6165 of 2013\n-11-:\nthe Act were incorporated therein. Therefore it is relevant to\nnote, what are the materials available for the prosecution to base\nits allegation of sale against the petitioner. Before adverting to\nthe basis for raising the allegation of sale, it is apposite to extract\nSection 55 of the Act hereunder:-\n“55. For illegal import, etc.-Whoever in\ncontravention of this Act or of any rule or order\nmade under this Act\n(a) imports, exports, transports, transits or\npossesses liquor or any intoxicating drug; or\nXXXXXAKX\n“(i) sells or stores for sale liquor or any intoxicating drug;\nshall be punishable\n(1) for any offence, other than an offence falling clause (d) or\nclause (e), with imprisonment for a term which may extend to\nten years and with fine which shall not be less than rupees one\nlakh, and\n(2) xxxxx\nExplanation: For the purpose of this section and section 64A,\n“intoxicating drug” means any intoxicating substance other than a\nnarcotic drug or psyshoctropic substance regulated by the Narcotic Drugs\nand Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (Central Act 61 of 1985) , which\nthe Central Government by Notification declare to be an intoxicating\ndrug.”\n14. In the case on hand, the basis firstly for the prosecution\nto allege sale is the hear say information that a person is\ntransporting liquor for sale, which according to the prosecution,\n\nbeeen\n2017/KER/49769\nCrl.M.C.6165 of 2013\n:-12-:\n\nis a reliable one. The basis secondly was the information given by\n\nthe accused himself while questioning that the liquor was\ntransported for sale. The basis thirdly was the bona fide belief of\n\nthe officer, who seized it. It is pertinent to note that an allegation\n\nof sale is difficult to sustain on the three grounds as projected\nabove.\n\n15. In order to charge the petitioner with an offence under\nSection 55 (a) or (i) of the Act, the prosecution must establish\nthat he is engaged in importing, exporting, transporting,\ntransiting, possessing, or selling or storing liquor or intoxicating\ndrug in contravention of the provisions of the Act or any rule or\nany order made under the Act. As per the Act, in order to be\nengaged in any of the acts aforesaid, valid documents conferring\nauthority are required. Therefore, the prosecution has also to\nestablish that the petitioner was engaged in activities of the above\nnature without any authority. As per SROs. aforementioned, for\ntransporting IMFL upto 3 litres, a permit is not required.\n\nional\neae\nBlokes\n2017/KER/49769\nCrl.M.C.6165 of 2013\n:+13-:\nTherefore, the petitioner cannot be found fault with as per the\nprovisions of the Act for transporting 1.5 litres of spirit without\nany authority. For the very reason, he cannot also be found fault\nwith under sub-sections (a) and (i) Section 55 of the Act.\nTherefore, the allegations against the petitioner as per Annexure\nA2 will not sustain and Annexure A2 and further proceedings\ninitiated pursuant to that are liable to be quashed.\nIn the result, this Crl.M.C. stands allowed. Annexure\nAz and all proceedings initiated by Additional Court of Sessions,\nKottarakkara in S.C. No.451/2013 on its basis, stand quashed\nforthwith.\nSd/-\nMARY JOSEPH,\nJUDGE\nhmh\n/{True copy //\nPA to Judge\n\n"
