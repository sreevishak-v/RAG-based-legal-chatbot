M.C No. 100 of 2015 & 101 of 2015\nDated this the 8\" day of January, 2015.\nORDER\nTwo prosecutions brought as case and counter, are sought to be\nquashed under Section 482 Cr.P.C on the ground of amicable settlement\nmade by the parties out of court. Crime No.998/2011 was registered in\nthe Vadakkencherry police Station under Sections 341, 323, 324 IPC, on\nthe complaint of one Kalidasan. The said case is now pending as C.C\nNo.57/2012 before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Alathur. The\nPetitioner in Crl.MC 100/2015 is the accused in the said case, and the\nfirst respondent therein is the said Kalidasan who made complaint. Asa\ncounter case Crime No.999/2011 was also registered under Section 324\nof IPC on the complaint of one Unnikrishnan who also sustained injuries\nin the incident. The said crime is now pending as C.C No.558/2012\nbefore the same court. The de facto complainant in C.C No.57/2012 is\nthe accused in the said case, and he is the petitioner in Crl.M.C\n1101/2015. Unnikrishnan who sustained injuries on the other side is the\nfirst respondent in Crl.M.C 101/2015. Now the parties have come to\nterms amicably, and nobody wants to continue the prosecution.\nUnnikrishnan and Kalidasan have filed affidavit to the effect that the\n\nBER El\n\n2015/KER/789\nCrl. M.C No. 100 of 2015 & 101 of 2015 2\nwhole dispute stands settled and resolved, and that they have\nno complaint or grievance now. I am well satisfied that there\nis a real and genuine settlement between the parties, and\ncontinuance of prosecution in such a situation will do harm and\nhardship to both the parties. In a situation of amicable\nsettlement nobody will support the prosecution, if the cases go\nto trial. Thus continuance of prosecution will be a sheer waste\nof time.\n\nIn the result, both the petitions are allowed. The\nprosecution against the petitioner in Crl.M.C 100/2015 in C.C\nNo. 57/2012 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,\nAlathur, and also the prosecution against the petitioner in\nCril.M.C 101/2015 in C.C No.558/2012 of the same\ncourt, will stand quashed under Section 482 Cr.P.C.\nAccordingly, the petitioners will stand released from\nprosecution, and the bail bond, if any, executed by them will\nstand discharged.\n\nSd/-\nP.UBAID,\nJUDGE\nsab\n\n: ee\nropes\n2015/KER/789\nCri.
