The crux of the prosecution case is that the petitioner\nherein had obtained a passport with forged documents. When this\nwas detected, crime was registered. The investigation is still\npending. According to the petitioner herein, the long delay in filing\nthe final report causes irreparable injury to him. He has now been\noffered a job abroad. Hence, he sought permission of the court\nbelow to apply for a fresh passport. Court below, by Annexure-B\norder dismissed the application on the reasoning that the\ninvestigation is still going on and if the petitioner is permitted to\nleave abroad, that is likely to hamper the investigation. Learned\nPublic Prosecutor submitted that the petitioner herein is alleged to\nhave changed photograph in his passport and hence the question of\nhis identity may also arise. It is further submitted that the\n\n2017/KER/951\nCrl.M.C.5273/16\n2\ndocuments have been forwarded to the FSL for expert opinion.\n\n3. Evidently, the disputed passport is with the investigating\nagency. Investigation has not reached its final stage in spite of long\nlapse of time. Petitioner herein may not be restrained on account of\npendency of the case, which would affect his livelihood. In the light\nof above, I am inclined to set aside the impugned order. The\npetitioner herein is permitted to apply for a fresh passport, which\nmay be issued by the authorities, if otherwise permissible, for a\nperiod not less than two years. It is made clear that this permission\nis only for the limited purpose for applying for a passport. For the\npurpose of permission to leave the country, petitioner herein shall\nmove the court below with appropriate application detailing the\ncountry which he proposes to visit, period of his stay there, purpose,\nhis contact details and also the period during which he proposes to\nleave the country. Court below shall consider it and permit him to\nleave the country for a period of one year at a stretch.\n\nCrl.M.C is disposed of as above.\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS\nJudge\nSbna/9/1/17\nTrue Copy /\nP A to Judge\n\n"
