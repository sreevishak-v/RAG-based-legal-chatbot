Vishnu residing at Thiruvathira Bhavan\nThrippadapuram Kulathoor P.O\nThiruvananthapuram\nBy Advocates:- M Anil Prasad\nCounter Petitioners :-\n1) Station House Officer\nKazhakuttom Police Station\n2) State of Kerala\nBy Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumari\nThis Criminal M.C. is coming on for hearing on 04.03.2025 and the court\non 05.03.2025 passed the following :\nORDER\nThis is an application filed by accused Nos. 1 and 2 in the above crime\nunder Section 483 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking regular\nbail.\n\n2\n\n2. The petitioners/ accused Nos. 1 and 2 are alleged to have\ncommitted the offences punishable under Sections 296(b), 115(2), 118(1) and\n109(1), r/w Section 3(5) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.\n\n3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- The 3\" accused\nand the defcto complainant are husband and wife. The friend of the defacto\ncomplainant sent some private photos and videos of the 3\" accused, while she\nwas abroad, to the defacto complainant, which he forwarded to the wife of the\n2° accused, and thereafter, the defacto complainant filed a divorce petition\nagainst the 3 accused. Due to that animosity, on 19.01.2025 at about 11.15\np.m., the 3 accused called the defacto complainant over phone to come to a\nplace near the Library at Thrippadapuram Temple, and when the defacto\ncomplainant reached there, the 3 accused quarreled with him, and at that time,\nthe 2\"! accused slapped on the left cheek of the defacto complainant, and the 1*\naccused abused and threatened him, and by using a chopper, hacked him on his\nleft hip, causing an injury, and the 2\" accused exhorted to kill him. Thereafter,\naccused Nos. 2 and 3 restrained the defacto complainant and the 1* accused\nhacked him above the left hip, causing a deep injury.\n\n4. Reportedly, the 1* petitioner / 1 accused was arrested on\n27.01.2025 and the 2™ petitioner / 2\" accused was arrested on 20.01.2025 and\nthey are in judicial custody since then.\n\n3\n\n5. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor.\nThe Investigating Officer filed report opposing the bail application.\n\n6. Heard. Perused the records.\n\n7. The only point to be considered is, whether regular bail can be\ngranted to the petitioners/ accused Nos. 1 and 2.\n\n8. The Point:- The 1\" petitioner / 1\" accused is the father of the 2\"\npetitioner / 2™ accused and the 3 accused. Allegedly, accused Nos. 1 and 2 had\nassaulted the defacto complainant, and the 1* accused had stabbed him, using a\nchopper. The marital problems between the defacto complainant and the 3\"\naccused is the motive of the alleged assault.\n\n9. According to the petitioners, they are absolutely innocent of the\nallegations levelled against them and they were arrayed as accused on the basis\nof the allegations of the defacto complainant, solely to wreck vengeance against\nthe petitioners due to personal and matrimonial disputes. It is submitted that,\nthe 1* petitioner is the father-in-law and the 2™ petitioner is the brother-in-law\nof the defacto complainant, and the 3 accused is the legally wedded wife of the\ndefacto complainant, and when she questioned the illicit relationship of the\ndefacto complainant with other women, their relationship got strained, and the\ndefacto complainant demanded divorce from the 3” accused. It is also\nsubmitted that, thereafter, the defacto complainant used to visit her home and\n\n4\nstarted threatening her after consuming alcohol, and none of the accused met\nthe defacto complainant on the alleged date of incident.\n\n10. The magnitude of the offence alleged is grave. Apparently, there is\nmarital dispute between the 3\" accused and the defacto complainant. It is seen\nfrom the First Information Statement given by the defacto complainant that both\nof them were living separately for the past three years and that a mutual divorce\npetition is pending before the court. Going by the First Information Statement, it\nis seen that the 3\" accused had called over phone the defacto complainant and\nasked him to come to a place to talk something and when he reached the said\nplace, the petitioners/accused Nos. 1 and 2 also came to the spot and there was\nsome altercation between the two, and consequently, the alleged assault\noccurred. It is stated that the defacto complainant had sustained deep injuries\nand he was taken to Medical College Hospital. The discharge summary of the\ndefacto complainant/victim appended along with the report shows that, he had\nsustained severe injuries, including fracture to rib, incised wound over left\nlumbar region, and incised wound over left flank. So there are corresponding\ninjuries. It is stated in the report that the chopper used for the commission of\nthe offence was recovered. So, the prosecution has made out a prima facie case\nagainst the petitioners and regarding the involvement of the petitioners in the\nalleged offence. The investigation in this case is progressing. The 1“ petitioner\n/ 1\" accused is in custody only for a period of 37 days and the 2\" petitioner / 2\"\n\n5\naccused is in custody only for a period of 44 days. It is stated in the report that,\nthe 1* petitioner is involved in eight other crimes and the 2\" petitioner is\ninvolved in two other crimes. So the criminal antecedents of the petitioners is\nnoted. It is stated in the report that, the 3% accused is yet to be arrested and her\nmobile phone is to be recovered. So, if the petitioners are released on bail, it\nmay hinder the arrest of the 3\" accused, and they are likely to influence or\nintimidate the defacto complainant and other witnesses and tamper with the\nevidence. So, the investigation will be adversely affected. The chance of\nabsconding also cannot be ruled out. Considering the afore aspects, including\nthe gravity of the offence, this court is not inclined to release the petitioners on\nbail at this stage.\nIn the result, this petition is dismissed.\nDictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and\npronounced by me in Open Court on this the 5\" day of March, 2025.\nNAZEERA S.\nSESSIONS JUDGE\n(Copies : 4)\nTyped by =: Manjusha\nCompared by :Rifa\nECS...\n\n6\nFair Copy of Order in\nCrl MC 647/2025\nDated:05.03.2025\n\n"
