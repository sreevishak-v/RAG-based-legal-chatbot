It is alleged\nthat the petitioner had obstructed the removal of an aged\nwoman, who was abandoned on the road, to the police\nstation for taking her to some old age home.\n2. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits\nthat on information that the aged woman was abandoned by\nsomebody on the road, the police reached there and they\n\n2018/KER/985\nCRL.M.C.No. 5516 of 2014 aoe\nwanted to somehow wash their hands and to send the aged\nwoman to the premises of the Attukal Bagavathi Temple.\nThe petitioner questioned the same and called media\npersons thereby the police was constrained to remove the\naged woman to an old age home.\n\n3. On a perusal of the report appended with\nAnnexure 1 FIR it seems that an offence under Section\n117(e) of the Kerala Police Act had not taken place. Apart\nfrom questioning the attempt of the police to send the aged\nwoman to some other place in order to wash their hands,\nnothing had happened. The police got irritated when media\npersons appeared at the spot. The prosecution of the\npetitioner in this matter is quite unnecessary and therefore,\nAnnexure II final report and all further proceedings pursuant\nto it in C.C.No.974/2014 pending before the Judicial First\nClass Magistrate's Court-l, Thiruvananthapuram in Crime\nNo.768/2014 of the Karamana_ Police Station,\nThiruvananthapuram, are liable to be quashed",
