Thereafter, on 13.11.2017 at 9.45 pm, the since Deceased\nsuccumbed to his injuries, while undergoing treatment. Thus, the Accused is\nalleged to have committed the above stated offences.\n3. This Court took cognizance in respect of offences under Sections 279 and\n304 A of the IPC and 3(1) r/w 181 MV Act and took the case on file. On issuance of\nprocess, the Accused entered appearance.

CW12 is no more and his death\n\n3\n\ncertificate was produced. The remaining witnesses were given up by the Learned\nAPP as the material witness turned hostile to the case of Prosecution. Since no\nincriminating circumstances arose from the depositions of the witnesses, the\nexamination of the Accused under Section 313(1)(b) of the CrPC was dispensed\nwith. No Defence evidence was adduced.\n\n5. Heard both sides and perused relevant documents. The following points\narise for consideration.\n\na. Has the Accused driven the aforesaid vehicle rashly, negligently in a\n\nmanner endangering the life of since deceased, causing injury to him and\n\nthereby committed the offence punishable under Section 279 of the IPC as\nalleged?\n\nb. Has the Accused by so driving the aforesaid vehicle in rash or\n\nnegligent manner hit the vehicle of since deceased and caused him to\n\nsuccumb to his injuries, and thereby committed the offence punishable\nunder section 304 A of the IPC as alleged?\n\nCc. Has the Accused drive the motorcycle has valid insurance on the\n\nrelevant day and thereby committed offence punishable under section 3(1)\n\nr/w 181 MV Act?\n\nd. If so, the proper sentence to be awarded?\n\n6. Points (a) to (c): These points are considered together for the sake of\nbrevity and to avoid repetition.\n\nPWI1 deposed that the since deceased is her father and that the incident\noccurred at 2018. He does not remember the date of incident. He deposed that he\nwas informed of the same by the Police through phone. Further he deposed that\nhe gave Exhibit P1 statement to the police on the basis of the Information received.\n\nA\n\nPW2 denied having witnessed the incident and turned hostile to the\nProsecution case. PW3 deposed that he is an Ambulance driver. He also denied\nhaving witnessed the incident and having given a statement to that effect to the\npolice and turned hostile to the Prosecution case. He deposed that the since\ndeceased was taken to the funeral cite from the hospital in his ambulance. On\nspecific question put forth by the Learned APP, he denied having stated to the\npolice that he witnessed the incident on his way back from a post-death ceremony\nand that it was on account of the rashness and negligence of the driver of the said\nAuto.\n\nPW4, the Investigating Officer deposed that he is acquainted with the\nsignature and handwriting of CW12, his colleague and identified his signatures in\nExhibit Pl and Exhibit P4 FIR. He deposed that he took over the investigation,\ncompleted the inquest proceedings and produced Exhibit P5 Inquest Report and\nalso Exhibit P6 Postmortem Certificate issued by CW11 before this Court. He had\nvisited the place of occurrence, inspected the same and prepared Exhibit P7 Scene\nMahazar; according to which, the place of occurrence is the portion of the tar road,\n1 meter 40 centimeters eastwards from the west tar end of Killipalam-Thampanoor\nRoad. He inspected the autorickshaw and its records produced on the basis of the\nExhibit P8 notice and Exhibit P8(a) reply notice; prepared Exhibit P9 Vehicle\nMahazar. The vehicle was inspected by the AMVI and Exhibit P10 Inspection\nReport is produced before the Court and thereafter it was released on Exhibit P13\nThird Party bail bond. Exhibit P11 Scene Plan prepared by the Village Officer is\nalso produced by him. The arrest of the Accused was recorded by him and the\nAccused was enlarged on Exhibit P12 bail bond and Exhibit P14 is the report\nreflecting the details of the Accused. Exhibit P15 is the report reflecting that on\ninvestigation, offence punishable under Section 3(1) r/w 181 of the MV Act is also\ninvolved in this case. He deposed that he completed the investigation and\nsubmitted the final report and could identify the Accused.\n\nThis Court has carefully gone through the materials on record and\nconsidered the submissions of the respective parties. On going through the\n\n5\n\nevidence on the record, it can be seen that PW1 does not have any direct\nknowledge as to the commission of the offence. Further, the witnesses who\nclaimed to have seen the incident deposed against the version of the Prosecution.\nThe contradictions in the deposition of the occurrence witness is not proved as and\nthe same have not been put to the Investigating Officer, when he mounted the box.\nThe deposition of PW1 cannot be admitted in evidence as the same is only hearsay.\nThe remaining witnesses were given up by the Learned Assistant Public\nProsecutor. There is nothing on record as revealed from the deposition of the\nwitnesses so as to implicate the Accused to the alleged incident that the Accused\nhad driven the autorickshaw in a rash and negligent manner, causing the injured\nto succumb to his injuries. Nothing has been brought out in evidence to the effect\nto prove the ingredients of the offences alleged. The Prosecution has failed to\nsubstantiate its case by adducing proper evidence and thereby failed to prove the\nguilt of the Accused beyond reasonable doubt. Hence Points (a) to (c) are found in\nfavour of the Accused.\n9, Point d: In light of analysis of the points hereinabove, since those are found\nin favour of the Accused, no sentence is to be awarded to the Accused.\n10. In the result, the Accused is found not guilty of having committed the\noffence punishable under Sections 279, 304 A of the IPC and 3(1) r/w 181 of MV\nAct Hence, the Accused is acquitted of the said offences under section 255(1) of\nCrPC. His bail bond stands canceled and he is set at liberty.\n(Dictated to my Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected by\nme and pronounced in open court on this the 31\" day of January, 2025)\n\nJudicial Magistrate of First Class-I\n\nThiruvananthapuram\n\n6\nAPPENDIX\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nPW1 Palaniammal(CW1) Occurrence witness\nexamined on 06.02.2024\nPW2 Anil Kumar C R(CW3) Occurrence witness\nexamined on 21.03.2024\nPW3 Vinod(CW2) examined on |Occurrence witness\n05.10.2024\nPW4 Subin Thankachan(CW13) |Police witness\nexamined on 28.12.2024\nB: Defence witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nNil Nil Nil\nC: Court witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\n\n7\nwitness, Medical\n=\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA.
