Hence, non bailable\nwarrant was issued by the court on 14/11/2017 and notice to the\nsureties ordered. The petitioner has approached this court\ncontending that she is ready and willing to appear before the court\nbelow, to submit herself to the jurisdiction and to participate in all\nfuture proceedings personally or through the counsel. Her\napprehension is that, if she appears, her application for bail is not\nlikely to be taken up on the same day. She further stated that, she\nis only 25 years old and seeks indulgence of this court.\n\nDale Dal\n2018/KER/49\n\nCrl.M.C.No.8829/2017 2\n\n2. Having considered the entire facts and the assurance\nmade by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner\nherein shall appear before the court below on all posting dates and\nco-operate with the trial, I am inclined to give one more\nopportunity to the petitioner herein to surrender herself before the\ncourt below within a period of ten days from today. If the\npetitioner so surrenders before the court below and _ files\napplications for bail and also for recalling the warrant, the court\nbelow shall take up those applications on the date of appearance\nand pass appropriate orders on the same day, having regard to the\nfact that essentially the warrant is issued to ensure the presence of\nthe accused and the purpose will stand satisfied once the accused\nappears. Warrant issued by the court below will be kept in\nabeyance till the date of appearance within the period of ten days\nfrom today.\n\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS\nJudge\ndpk\n/true copy/ PS to Judge.\n\nPelicigee ea al\nfe are\nBr\nBae\n2018/KER/49\nCri.M.C.No.8829/2017 3\n\n"
