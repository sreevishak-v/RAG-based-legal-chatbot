The petitioner claims that he\nhas entrusted the matter with a counsel at Kolkatta and\nhe proposes to appear before the court and to seek bail.\nThe apprehension is that in the mean while, warrant has\nbeen issued and he is likely to be arrested within the\njurisdiction of this Court. Learned counsel submits that\nthe he proposes to appear before the Kolkatta court\nwithin the time specified by this court. The learned\ncounsel relied on the decision reported in Madhusoodan\nv. Supt. of Police reported in [1992 (2) KLT 83]. In\nthe above decision, it was held that the place, where the\npetitioner herein apprehends the arrest is of crucial\nnature and having regard to that, a relief in the nature of\n\n2017/KER/948\nCRL.M.C.No. 156 of 2017 2\na pre arrest bail can be granted to meet the interest of\njustice.\n\n2. In the light of the above, I am inclined to\ndispose of the above Crl.M.C. with a direction that in the\nevent of the petitioner being arrested, he shall be\nreleased on bail on executing a bond of a sum of\nRs.50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand) with two sureties for\nthe like sum each and also on a condition that he shall\nappear before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court,\nKolkatta within a period of fifteen days from today. The\nabove order will not be in force after the expiry of fifteen\ndays.\n\nThe Crl.M.C. is disposed as above.\n\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS , JUDGE.\nRmm/9/01/2017\n/true copy/ PS to Judge.\n\n"
