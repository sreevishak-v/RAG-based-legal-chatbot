[have analyzed the evidence of PW1 to 8 and perused Ext P1 to P14 series.\nOn going through Ext P6 FIR it is seen that the incident occurred in between\n10.10.2013 to 31.10.2013 and information received the police station on\n02.11.2013. After that the FIR was filed before this court on 04.11.2013. It is\ninteresting to be noted that Ext P6 FIR registered by PW5 not recorded the\nreason for delay and instead of it, it is recorded as no delay. It is pertinent to\nnote that it is settled proposition of law that the delay in lodging the FIR and\ndelay in the sending of FIR before this court must be satisfied. The complaint\nfiled by the PW1. is silent about the name of the accused. PW3 deposed before\nthe court during the cross examination that he had taken down the FIS\nstatement of the PW1. But no such FI Statement was seen found in the\nprosecution records and the prosecution was no consistent version for this\nmatter. In this case, the allegation of the prosecution is that someone in\nbetween the dates 10.10.2013 to 31.10.2013 unauthorisly used the computer\ndatas of Marikar Motors, Thiruvananthapuram and done malpractice. To the\ntax returns and SBT bank accounts and thereby caused interruption to the day\nto day business affairs of the Marikar Motors, Thiruvananthapuram. It is perti-\nnent to note that none of the officials of SBI, Statue branch was examined by\nthe prosecution to strengthen the prosecution story. The prosecution bring a\nbundle of documents relating to the transactions of Marikar Motors Limited.\nExt P1 is the complaint, Ext P3 is the letter sent to the SBT Bank by Marikar\nMotors and another one is Ext P4 which is a return statement of Kerala\nCommercial Tax Department executed by the Manager, Marikar Motors.\nExt P2 is an another document sent by the accountant to the Assistant manager\nof Marikar Motors dated 23.10.2013. On perusal of this letter it is seen that\nthe Marikar Motors admitted the mistake crept in the password of commercial\nsite of the said company. The letter was found to be written on 23.10.2013.\nAs per the version of the prosecution witnesses accused is terminated from\nthis office prior to 23.10.2013. So the evidence brought out by the prosecution\nis not tally with the version of the prosecution that the accused unauthorisingly\n\n7\ndownloading or copying or interrupting the digital system of computer of\nMarikar Motors with a dishonest intention so as to cause any interruption to\nthe day to day business affairs of Marikar Motors.\n\n18. It is pertinent to note according to Section 43 of the Information Technology\nAct which imposes liability for defined set of action performed personally\nwhich subject to individual to penalties but not to criminal prosecution.\nHowever, when these actions was carried out with guilty state of mind as a\nspecified by fraudulently or dishonestly in section 66 of the Information\nTechnology act they constitute an offence. By virtue of section 66, additionally\nany act as defined u/s. 43 is done dishonestly and fraudulently attract section\n66 of the Information Technology Act. So in order to constitute the offence of\nsection 66 and 66 C of the Information Technology Act someone has to done\nact with dishonest or fraudulent manner and should cover the element of\ndeceit which is an additional concomitant for constituting act as cheating\nequivalent to the definition under section 415 of Indian Penal Code. Here in\nthis case, the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the offence of Section\n66 and 66 C of Information Technology Act against the accused based on the\nprosecution witnesses and documents the light of the discussions above\nmentioned. Hence, points no. 1 and 2 are found against the prosecution.\n\n10. Point no. 3:-In view of my findings on Points Nos.1 and 2, it is found that the\naccused is found not guilty for the offences punishable under Sections 66 and\n66 (c) of the Information Technology Act.\n\n11. In the result, the accused is found not guilty and acquitted under section 248(1)\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for the offences under sections 66 and\n66 (c) of the Information Technology Act. The bail bond of the accused stands\ncancelled and he is set at liberty.\n\n(Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected and\npronounced by me, in open court, on this the 20\" day of February 2025).\nSd/-\nJudicial Magistrate of the First Classâ€” TT\nThiruvananthapuram\n\n8\nAPPENDIX\nWitnesses for Prosecution:\nPW1/CW3: Soja, occurrence witness examined on 23.05.22\nPW2/CW1: Manikkuttan, informant examined on 12.07.22\nPW3/CW5: Prasantha, police witness examined on 12.07.22\nPW4/CW2: Babu, occurrence witness exmained on 26.09.22\nPW5/CW7: Sajikumar, police witness examined on 20.012.23\nPW6/CW9: Sudheer, police witness examined on 20.01.23\nPW7/CW6: K.E Baiju, police witness examined on 26.09.23\nPW8/CW8 : Santhosh, police witness examined on 11.01.23\nExhibits for Prosecution:\nPi : Complaint dated 26.10.13 proved by PW2\nP2 : Letter dated 23.10.13 proved by PW2\nP3 : E-mail dated 19.10.13 proved by PW2\nP4 : Return details dated 26.10.13 proved by PW2\nP5 : Return payment details dated 26.10.13 proved by PW2\nP6 : ELR dated 02.11.13 proved by PW5\nP7 : Bail bond dated nil proved by PW6\nP8 : Report dated 01.03.14 proved by PW6\nP9 : Report dated 11.03.14 proved by PW6\nP10 : Report dated 03.02.14 proved by PW6\nPil : For No. 15 dated 01.03.14 proved by PW6\nP12 : Letter dated 26.02.14 proved by PW7\nP13 series : IP address details dated 18.02.14 proved by PW7\nP14 series : Login details from 01.10.13 to 31.10.13 proved by PW7\nP15 : Report dated nil proved by PW8\nWitness for Defence: Nil\nExhibit for Defence: Nil\nMaterial Objects: Nil\nSd/-\nJudicial Magistrate of the First Classâ€” IIT\nThiruvananthapuram\n//True Copy//\n\n"
