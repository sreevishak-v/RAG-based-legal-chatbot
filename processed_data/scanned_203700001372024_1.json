It was further submitted that none of the\noffences alleged against the petitioners are made out, and\nhence the proceedings against the petitioners ought to be\nquashed.\n\n4. Smt.Sreeja V., the learned Public Prosecutor, opposed the\napplication and submitted that the nature of allegations as\nrevealed from Annexure-1 final report indicates that\nappreciation of evidence is required, which can be done only\nafter trial.\n\nBante\n2024/KER/2740\nCRL.MC 137/2024\n4\n\n5. Petitioner is alleged to have abused the de facto complainant\nand other police officers and even tore the name plate from\nCW1. According to the prosecution, when the accused was\nfound, during a vehicle check, roaming around in violation\nof Covid-19 restriction. He refused to stop the vehicle, and\nlater the vehicle was found parked on the side of the road\nand was taken into custody. In retaliation, the accused\nassaulted the de facto complainant and other police officers\nand even tore the name plate of the police officers.\nWhether such allegations are true or false is a matter that\ncan be appreciated only after adducing evidence.\n\n6. It is settled that the remedy under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.,\ncannot be invoked unless the admitted allegations do not\nmake out any of the offences alleged. A reading of the\nallegations as seen in the final report indicates that the\noffences can be made out if those allegations are admitted.\nTherefore, it is only after trial can any court can appreciate\nwhether those are proved or not. Thus Section 482 of\nCr.P.C. is certainly not a remedy available to the petitioners.\n\nBeer\n\neee RE\n\neae\n\n2024/KER/2740\nCRL.MC 137/2024\n5\nAccordingly, I find no reason to quash the proceedings\nC.C.No.1464/2021 on the files of the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate Court, Nedumkandam.\nThis Crl.M.C., is dismissed.\nsd/-\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\n\nAMV/12/01/2024\n\nae\n= nel 1\nBe shea\n2024/KER/2740\nCRL.MC 137/2024\n6\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 137/2024\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES\nANNEXURE 1 CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT IN\nCRIME NO.197/2021 OF NEDUMKANDOM\nPOLICE STATION\nTRUE COPY\n\n"
