He is charged with and proceeded against\nfor having committed offence punishable under Section\n324 of the IPC.\n\n2.The prosecution allegation is that on 15.4.2016 at 10 am\nthe petitioner had intentionally dashed his motor bike on\nthe body of the de facto complainant owing to previous\nenmity and caused injuries.\n\n3.Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the\nlearned Public Prosecutor.\n\n4.The learned counsel painstakingly took this court through\nthe prosecution records and made an attempt to convince\nme that even if the prosecution allegations are admitted\nas true and correct, the ingredients of the offence under\nSection 324 will not be attracted. According to’ the\n\n2016/KER/33673\n\nCrl.M.C. No. 4878 of 2016 -2-\nlearned counsel the prosecution had no case that the\npetitioner had committed the act intentionally or with the\nknowledge that it would cause pain. In view of the above\nAnnexure B final report cannot be sustained and prays for\nquashing the same. The learned Counsel has relied on a\nseries of pronouncements of the Apex Court as well as this\nCourt to advance his contentions.\n\n5.The learned Public Prosecutor on the other hand submitted\nthat final report has already been laid and the matter is\nnow pending before the learned Magistrate. According to\nthe learned public prosecutor the instant petition filed\nunder Section 482 of the Code is not liable to be\nentertained as the petitioner has an inviolable right to\nraise all his contentions before the Court below at the time\nof framing of charge and if the learned Magistrate\nconsiders the charge to be groundless, he is empowered\nto discharge the accused.\n\n6.

It has\nbeen held that while exercising jurisdiction under Section\n482 of the Code, the High Court would not ordinarily\nembark upon an enquiry whether the evidence in question\nis reliable or not or whether on a reasonable appreciation\n\n2016/KER/33673\nCrl.M.C. No. 4878 of 2016 -4-\n\nof it, the accusation could be sustained. That is the\nfunction of the trial Court. Section 482 of the Code is not\nan instrument handed over to an accused to short-circuit a\nprosecution and brings about its closure without a full-\nfledged enquiry. Though High Court may exercise its\npower to prevent abuse of process of any Court or\notherwise to secure the ends of justice, the power has be\nexercised sparingly and with’ circumspection. The\ninterference must be on sound principles and the inherent\npower cannot be exercised to stifle a legitimate\nprosecution. It is also settled that, if on taking the\nallegations and the complaint as they were, without\nadding or subtracting anything, no offence was made out,\nthen the High Court would be justified in quashing the\nproceedings in the exercise of its power under S.482\nCrPC.
