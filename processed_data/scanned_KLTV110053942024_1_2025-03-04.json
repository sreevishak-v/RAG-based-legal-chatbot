Manu Kallampally,Assistant Public\nProsecutor Grade-I)\nOrder : Dismissed\nThese CMPs having been heard on this day, and the Court on the same day, passed\nthe following:\n\n2\nCOMMON ORDER\n\n1. These are the applications filed by the prior registered owner and the\npossessor of the vehicle bearing No. KA-12-B-4357 (KL-01-CR-1112) under\nSection 497 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita.\n\n2. For the sake of convenience for passing a common order, these two petitions\nare clubbed together. For the sake of convenience, the prior registered owner\nin CMP No. 6605/2024 named Satheeshkumar and the present possessor of\nvehicle bearing no. KA-12-B-4357 (KL-01-CR-1112) named Nazarudeen\nwho is the rival claimant in CMP No.6544/2024 are mentioned herein in the\npresent order as petitioner and respondent accordingly.\n\n3. The petitioner herein through Crl.M.P No.6605/2024 filed a petition stating\nthat he is the original registered owner of an Innova Crysta car bearing no.\nKA-12-B-4357 (KL-01-CR-1112) which was purchased from Karnataka for a\nprice of Rs. 13,80,000/- . Subsequent to it, the said vehicle was handed over to\none Mr. A. Salim who is the managing director of Asia Stars\nCommunications Private Limited for the purpose of changing the RC book in\nthe name of the petitioner through the Regional Transport Department of State\nof Kerala. But the above named person Salim transferred this vehicle to\nanother person named Kunjumon Nazarudeen without the consent and\nconnivance of the petitioner. This matter was brought to his notice in the year\n2021 when he approached the Regional Transport Office. Consequent to it, he\nhad lodged a complaint before the Cantonment police station and after that,\nthe Cantonment police registered a crime vide crime no. 1197/2023 after\nreferring this matter to the Cantonment police station from this court. Now\nthe vehicle is kept unused for a longer period of time on the premises of\nCantonment Police Station. Hence the vehicle may be released to the interim\ncustody of the petitioner.\n\n3\n\n4. In the argument note filed by the petitioner, the person named A. Salim\nconspired with another person named Kunjumon, created a false transfer\ndocument by putting the false signature of the petitioner and transferred this\nvehicle through the Regional Transport Office. As per the Right Information\nAct supplied by the Regional Transport Officer now the said department is not\nin possession of any documents showing the change of RC book in the name\nof the petitioner and relevant documents connecting the change of ownership\nof vehicle in the name of Kunjumon from the name of petitioner. The\npetitioner now filed an appeal before the appellate authority of the Regional\nTransport Office, Thiruvananthapuram against the non furnishing of\ninformation relating to the said vehicle by the Regional Transport Office.\n\n5. In this case, the petitioner produced 11 documents which were marked as\nExt P1 to P11 and examined the petitioner as PW1. The petitioner adduced\ndocuments in support of it and stated that the person named Salim\nfraudulently transferred the vehicle bearing no. KA-12-B-4357 (KL-01-CR-\n1112) with the help of a person named Kunjumon and further transferred the\nvehicle to Nazarudeen. Nazarudeen changed the RC ownership with the\nprior forged documents created by Kunjumon with the help of Salim. The\ninvestigation in this case is going on before the Cantonment Police Station. At\nthis stage the vehicle is transferred to the respondent it would adversely affect\nthe investigation and every chance to alter, modify and transfer the vehicle to\nsome other person and could not recover it through the process of law.\n\n6. The respondent who is the petitioner in CMP No. 6544/2024 strongly\nopposed the contentions put forward by the petitioner herein. The respondent\nsubmitted that the vehicle was seized by Cantonment police as per the search\nwatrant issued by this court. The respondent submitted that he had purchased\nthe vehicle bearing no. KL-01-CR-1112 from his brother-in-law Kunjumon on\n15.10.2022 for an amount of Rs. 13.5 lakhs. Thereafter the RC ownership was\n\n4\n\nchanged through the Regional Transport Office, Thiruvananthapuram. The\nvehicle was purchased by Kunjumon from Satheeshkumar, the petitioner\nherein on 25.01.2021 for an amount of Rs. 13,00,000/-. It is stated that the\nsaid vehicle was originally registered in Karnataka in the name of Sivasankar\nin the year 2020. The accused named Salim in Crime no. 1197/23 approached\nthe person named Kunjnumon and offered to sell the vehicle. Relying on the\nwords of Salim, Kunjumon purchased the vehicle and changed the RC\nownership of the vehicle bearing no. KL-01-CR-1112 through Regional\nTransport office, Thiruvananthapuram. From Kunjumon the vehicle was\npurchased by respondent Nazarudeen who is the petitioner in CMP No.\n6544/2024. The respondent produced Ext D1 to D4 showing the ownership of\nvehicle bearing no. KL-01-CR-1112. Hence the vehicle may be released to\nthe interim custody of the petitioner.\n\n7. Heard both sides. Perused Ext P1 to P11, D1 to D4 and analysed the statement\nof PW1 and DW1 taken as a part of an inquiry u/s. 497of Bharatiya Nagarik\nSuraksha Sanhita.\n\n8. I have considered the contentions put forward by learned counsel for the\npetitioner and respondent as discussed above in CMP Nos. 6605/2024 and\n6544/2024. First of all the petitioner adduced a bundle of documents and\nraised a strong claim over the vehicle bearing no. KL-01-CR-1112 with the\nbackdrop of the registration of crime no.1197/2023 of Cantonment police\nstation. In this case, as per Ext P1 document which is a advance sale receipt\nexecuted in Kudak, Karnataka which shows the transfer of vehicle to the\npetitioner by one Mr. Sivasankar N.K. Ext P2 is a document obtained by the\nRight to Information Act which shows that the Regional Transport Office,\nThiruvananthapuram is not in possession of the relevant registration\ndocuments of vehicle bearing no. KL-01-CR-1112 after the registration of the\nvehicle in the name of the respondent. Ext P3 is another document which\n\n5\n\nshows that the vehicle was transferred from Satheeshkumar to Kunjumon as\nper the Right to Information Act given by the Regional Transport Office,\nThiruvananthapuram. Ext P4 is a document which shows the same matter as\ndiscussed in Ext P2. Ext P5 is another document issued by the Regional\nTransport Office, Thiruvananthapuram which shows the transfer of the vehicle\nfrom Sivasankar to the petitioner. Ext P6 is a document from the Regional\nTransport Office, Thiruvananthapuram which shows that a hearing was\nconducted in this matter by the Joint Regional Transport Officer and\nSri. Kunjumon was not present and did not participate in the said proceedings.\nExt P7 is a document showing that the matter was taken by the appellate\nauthority of the Regional Transport Office, Thiruvananthapuram. Ext P8 isa\ndocument which shows that the registration of the said vehicle was\ncompleted through the Regional Transport Office, Thiruvananthapuram.\nExt P9 is a document which is stick on by the counsel for the petitioner\nstating that it is an application for the transfer of ownership of the vehicle\nexecuted by the petitioner which is a forged document. Ext P10, Ext P11 are\nthe documents showing the transfer of other vehicles in the name of the\npetitioner. On the other hand the respondent filed four documents Ext D1 is\nthe sale agreement executed by the petitioner in favour of Kunjnumon and\nExt D2 is the sale agreement executed by Kunjumon in the favour of\nrespondent. Ext D3 is the registration document showing the ownership of the\nvehicle in favour of the respondent and Ext D4 is the insurance certificate in\nfavour of the respondent.\n\n9. As per the statements of PW1 and DW1 both of them are claiming ownership\nor possession over the vehicle bearing no. KL-01-CR-1112 based on the\ndocuments marked as Ext P1 to P11 and Ext D1 to D4.\n\n10.The questions that arise for consideration in this case are as follows:-\n\n1. Is the petitioner or respondent entitled to the proper custody of vehicle\n\n6\nbearing no. KL-01-CR-1112 pending the conclusion of the proceedings in\nthis case?\n\n2. Is the petitioner or respondent established superior title over the vehicle\nbearing no. KL-01-CR-1112 in the strength of the documents produced in\nthis case?\n\n3. Whether this court has the power to decide the question of the ownership\nand right of possession over the vehicle bearing no.KL-01-CR-1112 while\nconsidering an application for interim custody of the said vehicle as per\nsection 497 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita?\n\n11. In this case, this court elaborately discussed the contentions put forward by\nthe petitioner, and respondents based on their documents which are marked as\nExt P1 to P11 and Ext D1 to D4. For the sake of convenience point nos. 1 to\n3 can be considered together. In this case, the first question to be decided is\nwhether the court has locus standi to determine the ownership and possession\nof vehicle bearing no. KL-01-CR-1112 while considering the application for\ninterim custody of the vehicle under Section 497 of Bharatiya Nagarik\nSuraksha Sanhita. It is a settled proposition of law that the summary power to\norder custody under Section 497 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita is to\nbe exercised judiciously in respect of any property produced before that court\nin the circumstances contemplated under the said section. However, it should\nnot be exercised when the competent Civil Court is in seizin of the matter to\ndecide the question of ownership and right of possession. So the said power\nof the Magistrate does not extend the determination of the ownership of\nproperty so produced and the main purpose of such exercise when the\nproperty concerned shall be (1) the owner of the vehicle should not suffer on\naccount of its remaining unused or by its misappropriation, (2) the court or\npolice would not be required to keep the vehicle in safe custody as a vehicle is\nfor want of user, it is likely to get rusted. The interim custody of such a\n\n7\n\nvehicle is only a custody in trust for and on behalf of the court and its very\npurpose is nothing but it protect and preserve the property pending trial and\nalso to ensure control over it. While exercising the power, the court imposes\nor incorporates necessary precautions and conditions. To substantiate the view\ntaken by this court I have gone through the decision of the Hon’ble High\nCourt of Kerala in Saji Devan V. State of Kerala reported in 2009 (4) KHC\n882, it is held that Magistrate while exercising the power is not deciding the\nquestion of ownership and right of possession and competent civil court is\nvested with the power to decide the question of ownership and possession. So\nbased on the discussion, this court is of the opinion that this court cannot\ndecide the right of ownership and possession of a vehicle bearing no. KL-01-\nCR-1112 while considering an application for interim custody of said vehicle\nunder Section 497 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita. The limited\nquestion to be considered is who is entitled to the proper custody of the\nvehicle pending the conclusion of the proceedings in this case. In this case,\nanother peculiarity is that both the parties are claiming ownership and\npossession over the vehicle based on a bundle of documents. The petitioner is\nalleging fraud against the respondent for the creation of forged documents by\nthe prior owner of the said vehicle and challenging that the respondent is not\na bonafide purchaser. The respondent on the other side produced documents\nand asserting that he is a bonafide purchaser and purchased the vehicle for a\nvaluable consideration from his brother-in-law. Then another question is who\nis having superior title over the vehicle for the purpose of deciding the limited\nquestion of interim custody of the vehicle and who could best use the vehicle\nis yet another important consideration taken into account while considering\nthis application in this case.\n\n12. In this case, the police filed a report in two petitions. In both petitions, the\nstrong contention of the police is that investigation is going on in crime no.\n\n8\n1197/2023 of Cantonment Police Station registered against one Mr. Salim\nwho is alleged to have created forged documents and transferred the vehicle\nbearing no. KL-01-CR-1112 in the name of Kunjumon and thereafter to\nNazarudeen through the Regional Transport Office, Thiruvananthapuram. As\nper the police report the police sent notice to Regional Transport Office,\nThiruvananthapuram and as per the report of Regional Transport Office,\nThiruvananthapuram the documents showing the registration of vehicle\nbearing no. KL-01-CR-1112 in the name of the respondent is not in the\npossession of the Regional Transport Office, Thiruvananthapuram and they\ncould not find out the documents showing the ownership of the vehicle in the\nname of the respondent. Only after getting the documents including the\ntransfer application signed by the petitioner, the investigation could be\ncontinued including sending the disputed documents to the FSL department.\nAt this stage, the vehicle bearing no. KL-01-CR-1112 is released to the\ninterim custody of the respondent it would adversely affect the investigation\nand may transfer the vehicle. So as per the police report the Cantonment\npolice have strong objection to releasing the vehicle in the favour of the\nrespondent due to the reason that a crime was registered relating to this\nvehicle vide crime no. 1197/2023 before the Cantonment police station and\nthe vehicle was seized through the search warrant of this court. It is important\nto note that on perusing the documents of Ext P1 to P11 and on going through\nthe report of the police this court noted that the registration documents\nshowing the transfer of vehicle bearing no. KL-01-CR-1112 in favour of\nKunjumon from the petitioner and from Kunjumon to Nazarudeen were found\nmissing and an internal inquiry is going on in the Regional Transport Office,\nThiruvananthapuram by the appellate authority of said office in this matter.\nSo from the available documents, it is clear that the ownership of vehicle\nbearing no. KL-01-CR-1112 is under challenge before the Regional Transport\n\n9\n\nOffice, Thiruvananthapuram and under investigation as per crime\nno.1197/2023 of Cantonment Police station. Even though the respondent is\nholding the RC book of the vehicle bearing no.KL-01-CR-1112, the relevant\ndocuments were misplaced from the Regional Transport Office,\nThiruvananthapuram from where the RC book was issued. In Biju V. Sub\nInspector of Police reported in 1996 Crl Law Journal 1927 it is held that\nwho could best use the vehicle is yet another important consideration taken\ninto account while exercising the power under the said section. But the\nconsiderations like ownership in the Registration Certificate and being the\nperson who could best use the vehicle would lose all their significance when\nthe applicant is an accused alleged to have acquired the possession of the\nvehicle in question through the commission of an offence. In this case, as per\ncrime no. 1197/2023 of Cantonment police station one Mr. Salim is the\naccused who is not the party in this case. According to the respondent, the\nrespondent is a bonafide purchase as stated by him. But as per the police\nreport the investigation is going on and at this stage, this court cannot\npredicate who will be the accused in this case after the completion of the\ninvestigation of crime no. 1197/2023 of Cantonment Police Station.\nMoreover, a parallel inquiry is going on in the Regional Transport Office,\nThiruvananthapuram regarding the missing of registration documents\nrelating to vehicle bearing no. KL-01-CR-1112 registered in favour of the\nrespondent.\n\n13. It is a settled proposition of law that the registered owner is entitled to the\npossession of the vehicle. But if a rival claim was raised in this case by\nclaiming superior title over the vehicle bearing no. KL-01-CR-1112 by\nproducing a bundle of documents showing a cloud over the title of vehicle\nbearing no KL-01-CR-1112 by raising allegations against the Regional\nTransport Office, Thiruvananthapuram who is responsible for the due\n\n10\nregistration of the vehicle and consequent registration of crime vide crime\nno.1197/2023 of Cantonment police station for creating forged documents,\nthis court is of the opinion that even though the respondent is the registered\nowner as per Ext D1 to D4, he could not succeed in claiming a superior title\nover the said vehicle by rebutting the authenticity of documents vide Ext P1\nto P11 produced by the petitioner in this case. This court is of the opinion that\neven though the petitioner is a registered owner, he loss the entitlement to\nuse the vehicle on the reason that the vehicle was acquired and the possession\nof the vehicle in question through the commission of an offence. Hence by\nweighing the evidence of both the petitioner and respondent, the petitioner\nsucceeded in proving the superior title over the property at this present stage\nof proceeding. The order passed under Section 497 Bharatiya Nagarik\nSuraksha Sanhita is only intended to make a provisional arrangement with\nregard to the interim custody of the articles seized during the pendency of the\ntrial. The purpose of such an order is to protect and preserve the property\nduring the pendency of the trial. Therefore, even if any articles seized during\nthe investigation are released to the party concerned, the custody of the same\nis deemed to be retained by the court. While passing an order of release, it is\nbeing entrusted to the person to preserve the said article until the trial is over,\nwith an obligation to return the same to the court as and when required. The\ntitle or right of such person on such article is not to be decided. Therefore, the\ncrucial question to be decided while passing an order under Section 497 of\nBharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita is whether the person can be entrusted\nwith the property during the pendency of the trial. In other words, while the\nentrustment of a custody of an article to a person is made as per the order\npassed under Section 497 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, such a\nperson attains the capacity of the representative of the court only and he is\nunder constant obligation to return the same to the court when demanded. In\n\n11\nBasavva kom Dyamangouda Patel V. State of Mysore (1997) 4 SCC 358, the\nHon'ble Supreme Court explained in detail the object and scheme of Section\nA451 of Cr.PC. After referring to the aforesaid decision of the Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in Sundarbhai Ambalal Desai v. State of Gujarath_ reported\nin 2003 KLT 1089 while dealing with this matter regarding the release of\nproperty, valuable articles including the currency notes the following\nobservations were made. (1) preparing detailed proper panchanama (2) taking\nphotographs of such articles (3) after taking proper security. In Suresh Serve\nV. State of Kerala reported in 2020 (3) KLT 395 the Hon'ble High Court of\nKerala formulated certain additional guidelines with regard to the disposal of\narticles including currency notes.\n\n14. It was further held that the owner of the article would not suffer because of its\nremaining unused or its misappropriation. The Court or police would not be\nrequired to keep the articles in safe custody. If the proper panchanama before\nhanding over the possession of articles is prepared, that can be used in\nevidence instead of its production before the court during the trial. In this\ncase, based on the above discussion as this court discussed earlier that the\nlimited question to be considered is who is entitled to the interim custody of\nthe vehicle bearing No. KL-01-CR-1112. In this case there is a dispute with\nregard to the changing registration of vehicle bearing no. KL-01-CR-1112 and\ncancellation of the registration done by respondent in this case. It is pertinent\nto note that as per Section 55 of the Motor Vehicle Act if a registering\nauthority is satisfied that the registration of a Motor Vehicle has been obtained\non the basis of documents which are or by representation of facts, which is,\nfalse in any material particular before a registering authority, then the\nauthority shall after giving the owner an opportunity to be heard and reasons\nto be recorded in writing cancel the registration. In this case, the petitioner\nfiled appropriate applications before the Regional Transport Office,\n\n12\n\nThiruvananthapuram alleging the fraudulent act of creating forged document\n\nrelating to the said vehicle and registered a crime against one Mr. Salim for\n\ncreating a forged document and transferred the vehicle bearing no. KL-01-CR-\n\n1112 from the ownership of the petitioner. So from the records, it is prima\n\nfacie seen that the petitioner had made steps for the cancellation of registration\n\nof the ownership of vehicle bearing no. KL-01-CR-1112 which is now in the\n\ncustody of the respondent who is the petitioner in CMP No. 6544/2024.\n\n15. In Srei Equipment Finance Limited Vs. Ramjan Ali reported in AIR 2021\nSCC 326 it is held that the purchaser although claimed that he is a bonafide\npurchaser but the fact remains that he is the beneficiary of fraud. Purchaser\nhas no right to claim the release of the vehicle. Here in this case, the\nrespondent who is the petitioner in CMP No. 6544/2024 is the purchaser of the\nvehicle bearing no. KL-01-CR-1112. From the available records, the records\nprima facie seems that the respondent who is the petitioner in CMP No.\n6544/2024 is the beneficiary of an alleged fraudulent act as alleged in crime\nno.1197/2023 of Cantonment police station. Hence based on the elaborate\ndiscussion by weighing the validity of documents produced by both sides and\nbased on the statements of petitioner and respondent taken as a part of inquiry\nunder Section 497 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita this court is of the\nopinion that the petitioner in CMP No. 6605/2024 is entitled to get interim\ncustody of the vehicle subject to the following conditions:-\n\n1. The petitioner in CMP No. 6605/2024 shall execute a bond of Rs.\n13,80,000/- (Rupees Thirteen Lakhs Eighty Thousand Only) with two\nsolvent sureties and one surety shall be the resident of the State of Kerala.\n\n2. The petitioner in CMP No. 6605/2024 shall take the photographs of the\nvehicle bearing No. KL-01-CR-1112 in all angles and duly attest the same\nby petitioner and learned counsel for the petitioner and prepare a proper\npanchanama of the same.\n\n13\n\n3. The petitioner in CMP No. 6605/2024 shall not alienate or dispose of the\nvehicle through any document or otherwise until further order of this court.\n\n4. The petitioner in CMP No. 6605/2024 shall use the vehicle only after\ngetting proper documents in accordance with Motor Vehicle Act and Rules\nfrom the Regional Transport office concerned.\n\n5. The petitioner in CMP No. 6605/2024 shall use the vehicle only after\ngetting the order from the Regional Transport Office, Thiruvananthapuram\nws. 55 (5) of the Motor Vehicle Act and Rules regarding the cancellation\nof registration in the name of respondent who is the petitioner in CMP.\n6544/2024 and change of RC Book in the name of the petitioner named\nSatheesh kumar in CMP No. 6605/2024.\n\n6. The registering authority of the Regional Transport Office,\nThiruvananthapuram shall communicate the order u/s. 55 (5) of Motor\nVehicle Act and Rules if any, passed in case of filing of the proper\napplication from the petitioner named Satheeshkumar in CMP No.\n6605/2024 be communicated to the respondent named Nazarudeen who\nis the petitioner in CMP No. 6544/2024.\n\n7. The interim custody of vehicle bearing no. KL-01-CR-1112 given to the\npetitioner Sri. Satheeshkumar in CMP No. 6605/2024 shall be subjected to\nthe final order of the Regional Transport Office, Thiruvananthapuram\nregarding the cancellation of registration u/s. 55 (5) of the Motor Vehicle\nAct and Rules and also relevant orders regarding the usage of vehicles in\naccordance with Motor Vehicles Act.\n\n8. The petitioner in CMP No. 6605/2024 shall not use or make any alterations\nwithout the prior permission of the Regional Transport Office,\nThiruvananthapuram.\n\n9. The petitioner in CMP No. 6605/2024 shall produce the vehicle before the\nCantonment police station for the purpose of investigation in crime no.\n\n14\n1197/2023 as and when required by the investigating officer. In the\nmeantime, the investigating officer can seize the vehicle and can prepare\nrelevant documents including mahazar for the purpose of investigation in\ncrime no. 1197/2023 of Cantonment police station.\n\n10.The petitioner in CMP. No. 6605/2024 shall produce the original\ndocuments now in his possession showing the prior possession and\nownership of the vehicle. The Junior Superintendent of this office verify\nthe original documents and it should be attested by the petitioner in\nCMP No. 6605/2024. The original documents shall be returned to the\npetitioner.\n\n11. Communicate this order to the Sub Inspector of Cantonment police station\nand Regional Transport Office, Thiruvananthapuram for the speedy\ndisposal of the matters in connection with this case pending before the\nabove authorities concerned including the determination of change of RC\nbook by the Regional Transport Office, Thiruvananthapuram.\n\nNevertheless to say the respondent who is the petitioner in CMP No.\n6544/2024 and the petitioner in CMP No. 6605/2024 are at liberty to\napproach the competent civil court for the determination of the right and\nownership of vehicle bearing no. KL-01-CR-1112.\n\n12. The interim order of custody passed by this court is subject to the final\ndecree of competent civil court in connection with the ownership and\npossession of vehicle bearing no. KL-01-CR-1112.\n\nIn the result, CMP No. 6544/2024 stands dismissed and CMP No.\n6605/2024 stands allowed accordingly.\n(Dictated by me, transcribed and typed by Confidential Assistant and corrected by me and\npronounced in the open court, on this the 04\" day of March 2025)\nSd/-\nJudicial First Class Magistrate — III,\nThiruvananthapuram.\n\n15\nAPPENDIX\n\nCrl.M.P No.6605/2024\nWitness for petitioner:\nPW1 : Satheesh Kumar\nExhibits for_petitioner:\nP1 : Copy of Advance Sale Receipt dated 17.01.17\nP2 : Right Information Act letter dated 15.10.24\nP3 : Right Information Act letter dated 10.12.24\nP4 : Right Information Act letter dated 15.10.24\nP5 : Right Information Act letter dated 10.12.24\nP6 : Complaint dated 29.04.24\nP7 : Report dated 27.01.25\nP8 : Right Information Act letter dated 15.10.24\nP9 : Application for the transfer of ownership of the vehicle\nP10 : Application for transfer of other vehicles in the name of the\n\npetitioner\nPil : Application for transfer of other vehicles in the name of the\n\npetitioner\nCrl.M.P No.6544/2024\nWitness for petitioner :-\nDW1 : M.
