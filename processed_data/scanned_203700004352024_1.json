Petitioner’s application\nfor release of his passport was rejected by the learned Magistrate by\norder dated 05.01.2024 in Crl.M.P.No.1544/2023 referring to the\ncondition imposed by this Court in the order dated 08.12.2023.\n\n2. | have heard Sri.P.E.Sajal, learned Counsel for the petitioner\nand Sri.K.A.Noushad, learned Public Prosecutor.\n\n3. Pursuant to the registration of Crime No.991/2023 of\nBadiadukka Police Station, petitioner was granted an interim bail by\nthis Court on 08.12.2023. One of the conditions directed was to\nsurrender his passport before the jurisdictional court while executing\nthe interim bail bond. However, subsequently on 19.12.2023, when\nthe final order was issued by this Court, allowing the bail application,\nthere was no condition for surrendering the passport. Since the\ninterim order issued by this Court on 08.12.2023 has merged with the\nfinal order dated 19.12.2023, it can only be the final order that\nremains alive.\n\n4, As there is no condition directing deposit of passport in\n\nPlier\nPee\n2024/KER/6962\nCRL.MC NO. 435 OF 2024\n3\nthe final order, petitioner is not required to surrender his passport nor\ncan the court retained the passport already surrendered.\n5. In the above circumstances, there is no necessity for\neven a direction to lift or modify the condition regarding the deposit\nof the passport. Therefore, further retention of the passport of the\npetitioner by the court is not sanctioned by law.\n6. Accordingly, there will be a direction to the Judicial First\nClass Magistrate Court-ll to forthwith release the passport deposited\npursuant to the order dated 08.12.2023 in B.A.No.10435/2023 to the\npetitioner.\nThe Crl.M.C. is allowed.\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\njm/\n\nDsl\nBs Ceti ‘\naa eat\n2024/KER/6962\nCRL.MC NO. 435 OF 2024\n4\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 435/2024\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES\nAnnexure At TRUE COPY OF THE INTERIM BAIL ORDER OF THIS\nHONORABLE COURT IN BAIL APPLICATION\n10435/2023 DATED 88.12.2023\nAnnexure A2 TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER OF THIS HONORABLE\nCOURT IN BAIL APPLICATION 10435/2023 DATED\n19.12.2023\nAnnexure A3 TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER OF THE JUDICIAL FIRST-\nCLASS MAGISTRATE COURT-II, KASARGOD IN CMP\n1544/2023 DATED 5.01.2024\n\n"
