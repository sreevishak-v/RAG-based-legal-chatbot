This case is instituted upon the Final Report filed by the Sub Inspector of\nPolice, Sreekaryam Police Station in Crime No. 762/2017 for the offences\npunishable under Sections 294(b), 506(i) r/w 34 _ of the Indian Penal Code, 1860\n(hereinafter referred to as the ‘IPC’).\n2. The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: Due to the animosity\ntowards the Informant for having lodged complaint against the daughter of the i*\nAccused, the Accused persons, in furtherance of their common intention, on\n02.07.2017 at 10.30 am at Ulloor Village, on the road in front of the residence of\nthe Informant showered obscene words on her and criminally intimidated her with\nthreat to her life. The 1** Accused is alleged to have uttered obscene words to her\nand criminally intimidated her with injury to her life. Thereby the Accused are\nalleged to have committed the above-mentioned offences.\n3. The cognizance was taken on the basis of Final Report in respect of the\noffences under Sections 294(b), 506(i) r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. On\nissuance of process, the Accused Persons entered appearance before this Court.\n\n3\nThey were enlarged on bail. They were represented by a Counsel of their own\nchoice. Copies of all relevant Prosecution records were furnished to them.\nParticulars of offences were read over and explained to them, to which they\npleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.\n4. From the side of Prosecution CWs 2, 4 and 5 were examined as PW1 to PW3\nrespectively and Exhibits P1 to P4 were marked. The Prosecution failed to procure\nthe presence of CW1 and 3, and steps under Section 82 of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure (hereinafter referred to as the CrPC) was effected against them. The\nProsecution evidence was closed. The Accused were examined under Section\n313(1)(b) of the CrPC. They denied all the incriminating circumstances against\nthem and claimed innocence. No evidence was adduced by the Defence.\n5. Heard both sides and perused the documents. The following points arise for\nconsideration:\n\n(a) Have the Accused persons, in furtherance of their common intention,\n\nuttered obscene words to PW1 and thereby committed the offence\n\npunishable under section 294 (b)r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged\n\n(b) Have the Accused persons, in furtherance of their common intention,\n\ncriminally intimidated PW1 with a threat to her life and thereby committed\n\noffence punishable under Section 506(i) of the IPC as alleged?\n\n(c) If so, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded?\n\n6. Points (a) and (b): These points are considered together for the sake of\nbrevity and for avoiding repetition.\n\nPWI1 deposed that she has acquaintance with CW1 for several years and also\nwith the Accused persons as well. She does not remember the exact date of\nincident, but deposed that the same occurred about four to five years back. CW1 is\nthe sister-in-law of the husband of the daughter of the 2\"? Accused. They are\n\n4\nhaving certain family issues. On the date of incident the Accused persons together\ngot into the house of the Informant and uttered obscene words to her and they\nwere about to hit her. Informant lodged complaint before the Police and she also\ngave statement. She was present at the relevant time in the house of the\nInformant. It was around 12:30 PM to 01:00 PM. She deposed that the Accused\npersons threatened to hit Informant in her house, in case the latter would cause\nany problems and the Accused persons hit the Informant with a stick lying therein.\n\nPW2 deposed that he was the Senior Police Officer, Sreekaryam police\nstation at the relevant period of time. On the basis of Ext P1 FIS, he registered\nExhibit P2 FIR.\n\nPW3, the Investigating Officer deposed that he prepared Exhibit P3 Scene\nMahazar after visiting the place of occurrence, prepared Exhibit P4 Address\nReport and thereafter completed the investigation and filed Charge before the\nCourt.\n\nThe Learned Counsel for the Accused submits that the injured witness has\nnot turned up before the Court. The only evidence available is that of the alleged\noccurrence witness, PW1. PW1 has no consistent case and she is not a reliable\nwitness. She has not deposed what the alleged obscene words were, the nature of\nthose words and that the same had caused annoyance to her. No evidence\nforthcoming to the effect that the alleged threat was made with an intent to cause\nalarm and that such an alarm was caused in fact. On specific questions during\ncross-examination, PW3 admitted to have ascertained that there were ongoing\ndisputes between the parties and the same is also reflected from the evidence of\nPWI1 as well.\n\nI have carefully gone through the materials placed on record and\nsubmissions of both the parties. On perusal of the evidence led by the Prosecution\nand the materials on record, as rightly pointed out by the Learned Counsel for the\nAccused, the injured herself has not mounted the box. The evidence of PW1 would\n\n5\n\nreveal that she has even come up with a new case, which in fact, even the\nProsecution has not alleged. PW1 deposed that the Accused persons hit CW1 with\na stick, which is not even an allegation in the Prosecution case. Further she has not\ndeposed as to the exact words uttered alleged to be obscene, whether the same\nwas lascivious or so, and whether the same caused annoyance to her. The\ningredients of the alleged offences are not brought forth. There definitely arises a\ndoubt on the veracity of the evidence of PW1. In the aforesaid circumstances,\ntaking into account the absence of the injured, it definitely calls for other\ncorroborative evidence, which is conspicuously absent in the present case. Neither\nthe ingredients of the alleged offences, nor the involvement of the Accused persons\ncould be established beyond reasonable doubt by the Prosecution. Thus, this Court\nis of the view that the Prosecution has miserably failed to prove the involvement of\nthis Accused persons in the above Crime beyond reasonable doubt. Hence, Points\n(a) and (b) are found in favour of the Accused.\n\n7. Point (c): In light of finding in the foregoing points, this point does not\narise for consideration.\n\nIn the result, the Accused persons are found not guilty of having\ncommitted the offences punishable under Sections 294(b), 506(i) r/w 34 of the IPC.\nThey are acquitted of the aforesaid offences under Section 255(1) of the CrPC.\nTheir bail bonds stand cancelled and they are set at liberty.\n\n(Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her,\ncorrected by me and pronounced in open Court on this, the 30\" day of January,\n2025.)\n\nJudicial Magistrate of I Class -I,\nThiruvananthapuram\n\n6\nAPPENDIX\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nPw2 0 Mibleumar K(CW4) Police Witness\nB: Defence witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nC: Court witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA.
