No.2116 of 2015\nDated this the 21\" day of April, 2015.\nORDER\nThe petitioner is the fourth accused in NDPS\nCrime No.2/2014 of Excise Range, Erattupetta. The\nprosecution case is that the accused Nos.l1 to 3 were\nselling Ganja in an autorikshaw owned and possessed\nby the petitioner and when the Excise party came, they\nran away. The respondent took custody of the vehicle\nalong with 50 grams of Ganja in it and thereafter the\nvehicle is being kept idle in the premises of the\nErattupetta Police Station. The petitioner filed CMP\nNo.3511/2014 under Section 451 of the Cr.P.C. for\ngetting interim custody of the vehicle. The\nrespondent objected the said application on the\nallegation that the petitioner is a habitual offender\nand if the autorikshaw is released to the petitioner he\nwill again commit the very same offence. The legality\nand propriety of the findings whereby the court below\n\n2015/KER/17253\nCrl.M.C.2116/15-B 22:\nrejected the application under Section 451 of the\nCr.P.C. is under challenge in this Cr1.M.C.\n\n2. The learned counsel for the petitioner\nadvanced arguments challenging the findings whereby\nthe court below declined the grant of interim custody.\n\n3. Per contra, the learned Public Prosecutor\nadvanced arguments to justify the denial of the\ninterim custody.\n\n4. Going by the impugned order it is seen that the\napplication for interim custody was dismissed on the\nsole reason that the petitioner is a habitual offender\ninvolved in several crimes. But the particulars of the\nsaid offences, in which he was allegedly involved, are\nnot stated in the impugned order. Indisputably, the\nvehicle is being kept idle in the premises of the\npolice station in a position exposed to sunlight and\nrain and the vehicle will be ruined, if it is allowed to\nbe kept as such. In the absence of the particulars of\nthe offences, in which the petitioner is said to have\ninvolved, he cannot be treated as a habitual offender,\n\nPee\naaa\n2015/KER/17253\n\nCrl.M.C.2116/15-B 3:\nwho used the above said autorikshaw for the\ncommission of any other offence. In this analysis, I\nam of the view that no purpose will be served by\nkeeping the autorikshaw in the police custody ina\nway subject to speedy and natural decay. The said\nview is supported by the decision of the Apex Court in\nSunderbhai Ambalal Desai v. State of Gujrat [AIR (2002)\n10 SC 290]. Therefore, I am inclined to grant interim\ncustody of the vehicle to the petitioner subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\n(1)The petitioner shall furnish Bank Guarantee\nfor the value of the vehicle, which is to be\ndetermined by the competent authority.\n\n(2)The petitioner shall produce the vehicle\nbefore the concerned Magistrate's court as\nand when required.\n\n(3)In the event of failure to produce the\nvehicle, the court below is allowed to encash\nthe Bank Guarantee.\n\nThis petition is allowed.\nSd/-\n(K.HARILAL, JUDGE)\nokb.\n\n"
