OE!\nCrl.M.C.No.3949 of 2016\nDated this the 3 day of January, 2017\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner herein is the 6\" accused in CC.No.96\nof 2016 on the file of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-\nI, Kozhikode for the offences punishable under Sections\n143, 147, 341, 323, 332, 427 read with 149 of the Indian\nPenal Code.\n\n2. The crux on the prosecution allegation is that a\nteam of shadow police was on their duty at 10 pm on\n22.05.2015. They intercepted a group of six persons who\nwere drinking in a public place. When they were asked to\nmove out of the place, they questioned the shadow police\nand even after revealing the identity, they insisted for,\nseeing their identity cards. Thereafter they were\nchallenged, abused and beaten on the various parts of\nthe body. Crime was registered thereafter. In the\nmeanwhile it is further stated that keys of the their\nvehicles were also taken away by the group. They were\nsaved by the police who had reached the spot after\n\n2017/KER/52\nCrl.M.C.No.3949 of 2016 2\nreceiving the information. After investigation final report\nwas laid.\n\n3. The specific contention of the petitioner is that\neven as per the police records, he reached the spot later\nand he has been wrongly implicated. The available\nrecords do not support that stand. Since specific overtacts\nare attributed to the petitioner herein also. Having regard\nto this fact, I feel that it is a matter to be agitated before\nthe court below. I am not inclined to consider this Crl.M.C\nat this stage. It is dismissed reserving the right of the\npetitioner herein to move for discharge if so advised.\n\nCrl.M.C is dismissed.\n\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE\nRAV ITTRUE COPY/I\nPATO JUDGE\n\n"
