The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: On 19.112021 at 08.30\npm on the road near the house of SJ Bhavan, Manvila, the Accused persons, in\nfurtherance of their common intention slapped on the face of the Informant and\nuttered obscene words to her, due to the animosity in her son having thrown the\nbucket kept by the 3™ Accused for collecting the rain water. When the elder\nson of the Informant came seeing this, he was hit on his back by the 1** Accused\nhit and the younger son was hit by the 2\"? Accused and showered with obscene\nwords. Thereby the Accused persons are alleged to have committed the above-\nmentioned offences.\n3. The cognizance was taken on the basis of Final Report in respect of the\noffences punishable under Sections 294(b), 323 and 34 of the of the IPC. On\nissuance of process, the Accused persons entered appearance. They were\nenlarged on bail. They were represented by a Counsel of their own choice.\nCopies of all relevant Prosecution records were furnished to them. After\nhearing both parties and on perusing relevant records, particulars of offences\nwere read over and explained to them, to which they pleaded not guilty and\nclaimed to be tried.\n\n3\n\n4. From the side of Prosecution CW1 was examined as PWland Exhibit Pi\nwas marked. The Learned Assistant Public Prosecutor gave up the remaining\nwitnesses as the material witness herself had turned hostile to the Prosecution\nand Prosecution evidence was closed. Since no incriminating circumstances\narose against the Accused persons from the deposition of the witness, his\nexamination under Section 351(1)(b) of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita\n(hereinafter referred as the ‘BNSS’) was dispensed with. No evidence was\nadduced from the side of the Defence.\n\n5. Heard both sides and perused the documents. The following points arise\nfor consideration.\n\n(a) Have the Accused persons in furtherance of their common\n\nintention uttered obscene words to PW1 and thereby committed offence\n\npunishable under Section 294(b) r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged?\n\n(b) Have the Accused persons in furtherance of their common\n\nintention voluntarily caused hurt to PW1 and thereby committed the\n\noffence punishable under section 323 of the IPC as alleged.\n\n(c) If so, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded?\n\n6. Points (a) and (b): These points are considered together for the sake of\nbrevity and for avoiding repetition.\n\nPW1 deposed that she did not sustain any injury in the incident. The\nincident occurred about two years back on the road near her house and only\noral argument had taken place. PW1 denied having statement to police to the\neffect that Accused persons assaulted her and uttered obscene words to her.\nShe deposed that she is unable to identify the person with whom the alleged\narguments ensued.\n\nThe remaining witnesses were given up by the Prosecution as the\nmaterial witness herself turned hostile to the Prosecution and their examination\nwould only remain a futile exercise. I have carefully considered the evidence\nadduced by the Prosecution and the materials on record. It is pertinent to note\n\n4\nthat PW1, the injured herself is having no complaint or allegations that the\nAccused persons had assaulted her or uttered obscene words to her. She in fact\ndeposed that she has no such complaints against the Accused.\n\nOn perusal of the evidence led by the Prosecution and the materials on\nrecord, it is clear from the testimony of PW1 that there is no evidence to\nsupport the Prosecution case. None of the ingredients of the alleged offences\nare made out from the evidence adduced. There is nothing available on record\nto implicate the Accused to the above incident. Furthermore, PW1, when\nquestioned by the Learned APP admitted the case to have settled between the\nparties and compromise petition having been filed. The Compromise Petition,\nC.M.P. 3663/2024 was dismissed for the reason of involvement of non-\ncompoundable offence. Hence, on a total consideration of facts and\ncircumstances of the above case and on appreciation of the evidence adduced,\nthis Court finds that the Prosecution has failed to prove the case against the\nAccused persons and therefore, Points (a) to (e) are found in favour of the\nAccused persons.\n\n8. Point (c): In wake of analysis and finding on the forgoing points, this\npoint does not arise for consideration.\n\nIn the result, 1% and 2\"? Accused are found not guilty of having\ncommitted the offences punishable under Sections 294(b), 323 and 34 of the\nIPC. They are acquitted of the aforesaid offences under Section 278(1) of the\nBNSS. Their bail bonds stand cancelled and they are set at liberty.\n\n(Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected\nby me and pronounced in open Court on this, the 30\" day of December, 2024.)\nJudicial Magistrate of First Class -I,\nThiruvananthapuram\n\n5\nAPPENDIX\n\nA: Prosecution witness\n\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\n\nPW1 S Sasikumari(CW1) Injured witness\n\nexamined on 26-11-21\n\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\n\nC: Court witness\n\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\n\nNil Nil Nil\n\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA.
