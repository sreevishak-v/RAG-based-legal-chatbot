NIDHIN KUMAR A.P.\nSRI B JAYASURYA PP\n\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n\n04.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\n_\nBis\n2019/KER/340\nCr1.MC.No. 8093 of 2018\n2\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner is a handicapped man and is a singer of some\nrepute. He faces accusation of having committed offence under\nSections 376(2)(n) and 506 of the IPC, and Section 67(A) of the\nInformation Technology Act, 2002, in S.C. No.1090 of 2017 on the\nfile of the Additional Sessions Court-I, Manjeri.\n\n2. The 2\" respondent, who was a married woman and the\nmother of three children, lodged a complaint before the police on\n02.01.2016 alleging that the petitioner herein, by threatening that\nher explicit photographs would be circulated online, induced her to\nhave a sexual relationship with him. She was subjected to rape in\nher house and in a hotel at Ooty in the year 2015. The crime was\ninvestigated and final report was laid before the jurisdictional court.\n\n3. The above criminal proceedings are sought to be quashed\nby invoking the inherent powers of this Court under Section 482 of\nthe Cr.P.C.\n\n4. The 2” respondent, who is the de facto complainant, has\nfiled an affidavit stating that she was in love with the petitioner\n\n_\nBis\n2019/KER/340\nCr1.MC.No. 8093 of 2018\n3\nherein and when this fact came to the knowledge of her near\nrelatives, they had forced her to lodge a complaint leveling false\naccusations. According to the 2™ respondent, her former husband\nhas divorced her and she has now married the petitioner herein.\nShe would refer to Anneuxre-B certificate of marriage issued by the\nMarriage Officer, Tirur to substantiate her contention. She would\nalso refer to Annexure-C affidavit sworn to by her and contended\nthat the continuance of criminal proceedings is an abuse of process\nand would prove detrimental to her married life.\n\n5. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner\nsubmitted that the petitioner is a renowned singer and the 2\"\nrespondent had fallen in love with him. When the matter came to\nthe knowledge of her former husband, she was forced to lodge a\ncomplaint. Immediately thereafter, both parties divorced their\nrespective spouses and have got married.\n\n6. The learned Public Prosecutor was directed to get\ninstructions. It is submitted that the investigating officer has\nrecorded the statement of the victim and she has stated in clear\nterms that she has no grievance against the petitioner herein.\n\n_\nBis\n2019/KER/340\nCr1.MC.No. 8093 of 2018\nA\n\n7. I have considered the submissions advanced and have\nperused the materials made available.\n\n8. The legal position with regard to quashing of proceedings\non the basis of compromise between the parties is by now well\nsettled. It has been held that the power of the High Court in\nquashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its\ninherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to\na criminal Court for compounding the offences under Section 320 of\nthe Code. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or\ncomplaint or FIR may be exercised where the offender and victim\nhave settled their dispute would depend on the facts and\ncircumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed.\nHowever, before exercise of such power, the Court will have to give\ndue regard to the nature and gravity of the crime. It is also settled\nthat heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences\nlike murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot quashed even though the\nvictim or victim's family and the offender have settled the dispute.\nSuch offenses are not private in nature and have serious impact on\nsociety. The directions of the Apex Court in Gian Singh v. State of\n\n_\nBis\n2019/KER/340\nCr1.MC.No. 8093 of 2018\n5\n\nPunjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303] and in Narinder singh v. State of\nPunjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466 ] serve as guiding lights.\n\n9. Insofar as the offence of rape is concerned, there cannot\nbe any doubt that the same cannot be settled on the strength of a\ncompromise arrived at between the victim and the accused. The\nApex Court in State of M.P. v. Madan Lal [2015 (7) SCC 681],\nrelying on the decision in Shimbhu_ and Another v. State _ of\nHaryana [2014 (13) SCC 318] has clearly reminded the Courts that\nrape is a non-compoundable offence and it is an offence against the\nsociety and is not a matter to be left for the parties to compromise\nand settle. This was because of the fact that the Court cannot\nalways be assured that the consent given by the victim in\ncompromising the case is a genuine consent. There is every chance\nthat the victim might have been pressurised by the accused or the\ntrauma undergone by her all the years might have compelled her to\nopt for a compromise. In such cases, the accused may use all his\ninfluence to pressurise the victim for a compromise. It was taking note\nof this aspect that it was held that it would not be safe in considering\nthe compromise arrived at between the parties in rape cases.\n\n_\nBis\n2019/KER/340\nCr1.MC.No. 8093 of 2018\n6\n\n10. However, in the instant case, it is borne out from the\nstatement of the 2\"? respondent recorded by the investigating officer\nthat the parties were in love and the Crime was registered due to\nthe circumstances prevailing then. Annexure-B would show that the\nparties have married and they are living together as husband and\nwife. There is no case for anyone that the dignity of the 2\"\nrespondent was violated by a wanton act of the petitioner. This\nis not one of those cases, wherein the allegations reek of\nextreme depravity, perversity or cruelty. It cannot be said that the\noffence in the instant case would fall in the category of offences that\nhave a serious impact on society. In the peculiar facts of the\ninstant case, grave hardship and inconvenience will be caused to\nthe 2™ respondent, if the prosecution is permitted to continue. She\nhas also filed an affidavit stating that she is not desirous of\nprosecuting against her husband any further. In that view of the\nmatter, the prospects of an ultimate conviction is remote and bleak\neven if the case is proceeded with. Furthermore, the 2\" respondent\ncan continue with her life with dignity and respect. Having\nconsidered all the relevant circumstances, I am _ of the\nconsidered view that this is a fit case in which this Court will\n\nRee Tal\nBaers\n2019/KER/340\nCr1.MC.No. 8093 of 2018\n7\nbe well justified in invoking its extraordinary powers under\nSection 482 of the Code to quash the proceedings.\n\nIn the result this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-A Final\nreport and all further proceedings pursuant thereto against the\npetitioner in SC No. 1090/2017 on the file of Additional Sessions\nCourt-I, Manjeri are quashed.\n\nSD/-\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN V.,\nJUDGE\navs //TRUE COPY// P.A.
