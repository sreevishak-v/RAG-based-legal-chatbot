Nos. 5435 of 2016 & 6969 of 2017\nDated this the 8‚Äù day of December, 2017\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner herein who is the respondent in M.C.\nNo.842/2010 of the Family Court, Tirur suffered an order of\nmaintenance under Sections 125(3) and 128 of Cr.P.C. In\nexecution proceedings, the petitioner was brought under arrest\nand by Annexures A2 and A3 orders, the court below on the date\nof his surrender noted that he has committed default and ordered\nhim to be detained for separate specified periods mentioned in\nAnnexures A2 and A3. This is assailed in Crl.M.C. No.5435/2016.\nThe petitioner was ordered to be released by the order of this\nCourt dated 26.08.2016 relying on the decisions reported in\nAbdulrahiman v. State of Kerala (2011 (4) KLT 124) and\nMohandas V. Jayanthi (2012 (3) KLT 43) on a premise that\nthe petitioner was ordered to be detained without compliance of\nthe statutory formalities.\n\n2.  Cri.M.C. No.6969/2017 arises from the order in Crl.M.P.\nNo.457/2016 in M.C. No.842/2010. In that also, the petitioner was\nbrought under arrest finding that the petitioner has committed\ndefault of 13 months and he was ordered detention of 15 days for\n\nBl\nesas\n2017/KER/49761\nCri. M. C. Nos. 5435 of 2016 & 6969 of 2017\neach months default. This is the subject matter of Crl.M.C.\nNo.6969/2017. In that, by order dated 11.10.2017, the petitioner\nwas ordered to be released on the same reason as mentioned in\nconnected Crl.M.C.\n\n3. |The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner\nis that, the court should have conducted an enquiry as to whether\npetitioner herein has committed any default without any reason.\nThis was considered by this Court in the above said decisions.\nNecessarily, the court is bound to conduct an enquiry into that.\n\n4. The petitioner has a further case that the applications\nfor execution are barred by limitation, in so far as it relates to the\nperiod beyond one year from the due date. To buttress that\nargument, the learned counsel for the petitioner relied on the\ndecisions reported in Abdulrahiman's case and Mohandas'\ncase as well as Ali.C and others V. State of Kerala and\nOthers (2013 (4) KHC 871).\n\n5. Having regard to the above two contentions taken up\nby the learned counsel for the petitioner, | am inclined to set\naside Annexures A2 and A3 orders in Crl.M.C. No.5435/2016 and\nAnnexure A2 in Crl.M.C. No.6969/2017. The matters are remitted\n\nesas\n2017/KER/49761\nCri. M. C. Nos. 5435 of 2016 & 6969 of 2017\nback to the court below to consider, in the light of the decisions\nreferred to the above, whether there was default without any\nreason from the part of the petitioner herein. The court shall also\nconsider the question whether the applications for execution in\nCri.M.C. No.5435/2016 and in Crl.M.C. No. 6969/2017 are beyond\nthe prescribed period under the statute. Any other preliminary\nobjection raised by the petitioner herein shall also be raised by\nthe court below. The court below shall thereafter proceed in\naccordance with law.\nCrl.M.Cs. are allowed to the above extent.\nSd/-\n\nSUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE.\n\nPn\n\n"
