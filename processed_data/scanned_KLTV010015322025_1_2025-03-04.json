    "outcome": "ORDER\n\nThis is the 2™ application filed by the sole accused in the above crime\nunder Section 483 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking regular\nbail.\n\n2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable\nunder Sections 62 of 64(1), 74, 127(2) and 332(b) of the Bharatiya Nyaya\nSanhita.\n\n3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- On 19.01.2025 at\n5.30 p.m., the accused, trespassed into the rented apartment of the defacto\ncomplainant bearing door No. 614/1, situated at Kattayikonam in Ayirooppara\n\n2\nVillage, and thereafter, locked the room, while the defacto complainant was\ninside the room. Thereafter, the accused grabbed the defacto complainant from\nbehind, closed her mouth, fisted on her back and attempted to commit rape upon\nher. When the defacto complainant cried aloud, the neighbours came there, and\nat that time, the accused escaped from there.\n\n4. Reportedly, the petitioner/accused was arrested on 20.01.2025 and\nhe is in custody since then.\n\n5. The earlier bail application filed by the petitioner was dismissed by\nthis Court as per Order dated 14.02.2025 in Criminal M.C.No. 394/2025.\n\n6. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor.\nThe Investigating Officer filed report opposing the bail application.\n\n7. Heard. Perused the records.\n\n8. The only point to be considered is, whether regular bail can be\ngranted to the petitioner/accused.\n\n9. ‘The Point:- The defacto complainant and the petitioner are totally\nstrangers. As per the allegations, the petitioner/accused trespassed into the\nresidence of the defacto complainant and attempted to commit rape upon her.\n\n10. According to the petitioner, he is innocent of the allegations\nlevelled against him and the registration of this crime is a corollary of strained\nrelationship between the petitioner and the local leaders of ruling party. It is\nsubmitted that, while going through the First Information Statement given by\n\n3\nthe defacto complainant, it is seen that the ingredients of the offences\npunishable u/ss. 74, 62 of 64, 127(2) and 332(b) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita are\nabsent in this case.\n\n11. The magnitude of the offence alleged is grave. However, it is seen\nfrom the report filed by the Investigating Officer that the CCTV footages were\ncollected, the dresses worn by the accused were seized, the scene mahazar was\nprepared, and the statement of the victim under Section 183 of the Bharatiya\nNagarik Suraksha Sanhita was recorded. It is also stated in the report that the\nreport of medico-legal examination of the victim was obtained. It appears that\nmajor part of the Investigation is over. The petitioner/ accused is in judicial\ncustody for a period of 44 days. So even if the petitioner is released on bail,\nthere is nothing much, which will adversely affect the investigation. No\ncriminal antecedents of the petitioner is brought to the notice of this court.\nConsidering all the afore aspects, I am of the view that, the petitioner/accused\ncan be enlarged on bail subject to conditions.\n\nIn the result, the petition is allowed",
