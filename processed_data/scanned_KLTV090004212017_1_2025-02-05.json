This is a case instituted upon the Final report filed by Sub Inspector of\nPolice, City Traffic Police Station in Crime No. 1325/16 for the offences punishable\nunder Sections 279, 304 A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860(hereinafter referred to\nas ‘the IPC’) and 146 r/w 196 of Motor Vehicles Act, (hereinafter referred to as the\n‘MV Act’).\n2. The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: The Accused being the rider\nof the motor cycle bearing Registration No. KL 20F 2761, without having valid\ninsurance, drove it via Kowdiar to Paipinmood road, rashly, negligently, and in a\nmanner so as to endanger human life and at high speed about 8.30 PM on\n16.03.2016 and hit another motor cycle bearing Registration No. KL 01 BM 7854\ndriven by the since deceased, near the Golf Links Road. Due to its impact, the since\ndeceased sustained grievous injuries and was taken to Medical College Hospital,\nThiruvananthapuram. Thereafter, on 23.03.2016, the since Deceased succumbed\nto his injuries., while undergoing treatment. Thus, the Accused is alleged to have\ncommitted the above stated offences.\n\n3\n\n3. This Court took cognizance in respect of offences under Sections 279 and\n304 A of the IPC, and Section 146 r/w 196 of the MV Act. On issuance of process,\nthe Accused entered appearance. He was enlarged on bail. He was represented by\na Counsel of his own choice. Copies of all relevant prosecution records were\nfurnished to him. The particulars of the aforesaid offences were read over and\nexplained to him, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.\n4. From the side of Prosecution, CWs2, 7, 10 and 1 were examined as PWs 1 to\n4 respectively and Exhibit Pl and P2 were marked. The presence of CW8 and 9\ncould not be procured by the Prosecution and report filed to the effect that their\npresence cannot be procured in the near future. Death Certificate of CW18 was\nproduced. The remaining witnesses were given up by the Learned APP as the\nmaterial witness turned hostile to the case of Prosecution. Since no incriminating\ncircumstances arose from the depositions of the witnesses, the examination of the\nAccused under Section 313(1)(b) of the CrPC was dispensed with. No Defence\nevidence was adduced.\n5, Heard both sides and perused relevant documents. The following points\narise for consideration.\n\na. Has the Accused driven the aforesaid vehicle rashly, negligently in a\n\nmanner endangering the life of PW1, causing injury to him and thereby\n\ncommitted the offence punishable under Section 279 of the IPC as alleged?\n\nb. Has the Accused by so driving the aforesaid vehicle in rash or\n\nnegligent manner hit the vehicle of since deceased and caused him to\n\nsuccumb to his injuries, and thereby committed the offence punishable u/S.\n\n304 A of the IPC as alleged?\n\nCc. Has the Accused driven the vehicle without having a valid insurance\n\nand thereby commit offence punishable under section 146(1) r/w 196 of MV\n\nAct as alleged?\n\nd. If so, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded?\n\nA\n6. Points (a) to (c): These points are considered together for the sake of\nbrevity and to avoid repetition.\n\nPW1 deposed that the deceased is the son of her friend and that she had\nattested as witness to the Inquest proceedings and identified her sign in Exhibit P1\nInquest Report. PW2 and PW3 denied having witnessed the incident, having given\nstatement to that effect to the police and turned hostile to the Prosecution case.\nPW4 deposed that the deceased is his nephew. The accident took place on\n16.03.201 near Golf Links Club at 8.25 pm. He deposed that he was informed of\nthe same by the Police through phone and when he reached Medical College\nHospital, he found the Accused to be sustained with grevious injuries on face.\nFurther he deposed that he gave Exhibit P2 statement to the police.\n\nOn going through the evidence on the record, it can be seen that PW4 does\nnot have any direct knowledge as to the commission of the offence. Further, the\nwitnesses who claimed to have seen the incident deposed against the version of\nthe Prosecution. The presence of other occurrence witnesses could not be\nprocured by the Prosecution. The deposition of PW4 cannot be admitted in\nevidence as the same is only hearsay. The remaining witnesses were given up by\nthe Prosecution as no purpose would be served by examining them in the said\ncircumstances. Except for the mere allegation in the Charge that there was no\nvalid insurance policy on the motor cycle, no evidence brought forth to prove the\nsame. Nor any person acquainted with the handwriting and sign of Investigating\nOfficer examined. There is nothing on record as revealed from the deposition of the\nwitnesses so as to implicate the Accused to the alleged incident. The Prosecution\nhas failed to substantiate its case by adducing proper evidence and thereby failed\nto prove the guilt of the Accused beyond reasonable doubt. Hence Points (a) to (c)\nare found in favour of the Accused.\n\n7. Point d: In light of the finding on the above points, the question of awarding\nsentence to the Accused does not arise.\n\n5\n8. In the result, the Accused is found not guilty of having committed the\noffences punishable under Sections 279, 304 A of the IPC and 146 r/w 196 of MV\nAct. Hence, the Accused is acquitted of the said offences under section 255(1) of\nCrPC. His bail bond stands canceled and he is set at liberty.\n(Dictated to my Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected by\nme and pronounced in open court on this the 5\" day of February, 2025)\nJudicial Magistrate of First Class-I\nThiruvananthapuram\nAPPENDIX\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA: Prosecution witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nPW1 Bindhu Sreekumar(CW2) [Occurrence witness\nexamined on 19.05.2022\nPW2 Rajesh(CW7) examined on |Occurrence witness\n19.08.2023\nPW3 Maniyan(CW10) examined |Occurrence witness\non 26.09.2023\nPW4 Anil Kumar G(CW1) Occurrence witness\n\n6\nPramines on 02.12.2023 |\n\nB: Defence witness\n\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\n\nNil Nil Nil\n\nC: Court witness\n\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\n\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA.
