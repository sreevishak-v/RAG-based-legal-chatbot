The petitioner was not available for trial and\nthe case against him was split up and re-filed and later\nthe case was included in the list of long pending case as\nabove. The petitioner seeks for issuance of appropriate\ndirections to the learned Magistrate to consider his\napplication for recall of warrant and grant of Bail on the\ndate of surrender itself and to grant him Bail.\n\n2016/KER/33672\n\nCrl.M.C. No.4873 of 2016 -2-\n\n3.It was owing to the contumacious conduct of the\npetitioner, that Non Bailable Warrant was issued against\nhim to secure his presence before the court below. This\ncourt in exercise of powers under Section 482 of the Code\nof Criminal Procedure will not be justified in interfering\nwith the discretion of the learned Magistrate in granting\nbail.\n\n4.It is for the petitioner to approach the learned Magistrate\nand appraise the reasons for his absence and to seek for\nrecalling the warrant and grant of Bail. There is no reason\nfor this Court to assume that the learned Magistrate will\nnot exercise his discretion judicially and in accordance\nwith law.\n\n5.In the result, the petitioner is directed to surrender before\nthe learned Magistrate within 3 weeks from the date of\nthis order and prefer application for recall of warrant and\nalso for grant of bail with advance notice to the prosecutor\nconcerned. In that event the learned Magistrate is directed\n\nPeel\na\n2016/KER/33672\nCrl.M.C. No.4873 of 2016 -3-\nto consider and dispose of the said application, preferably\non the same day itself, on its merits and in accordance\nwith law.
