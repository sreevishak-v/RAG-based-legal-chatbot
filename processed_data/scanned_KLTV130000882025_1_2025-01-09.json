L.R.Rahul)\nCounter petitioner : State of Kerala represented by the Sub Inspector of\nPolice, Mannanthala Police Station.\n(By Assistant Public Prosecutor)\nOffence : Uj/ss. 296(b), 118(1), 329(3) BNS and 31(1) of Domestic\nViolence Act.\nOrder : Allowed.\nThis petition having been heard today the court passed the following:-\nORDER\n\n1. This is the 2\" petition filed u/s. 480 of BNSS 2023 by the petitioner / accused\nin Crime No. 895/2024 of Mannanthala Police Station.\n\n2. Offence alleged against the petitioner / accused is U/ss. 296(b), 118(1), 329(3)\nBNS and 31(1) of Domestic Violence Act.\n\n3. The prosecution case in brief as follows:- In violation of the protection order\npassed against the accused in CMP No. 1337/2021, on 15.06.2024 , at 11.00\npm the accused trespassed into the house of informant, Siva Deepam Veedu,\nSreevalsam Lane, Mukkolakkal P.O and attempted to break her hands,\nsubsequently on 08.09.2024, at 19.30 hours, the accused by uttering obscene\nwords beaten her with a frond, when she fell down, he further struck her with\nthe same, resulting in severe injury. Thus the accused has committed offences\n\n2\npunishable u/ss. 296(b), 118(1), 329(3) BNS and 31(1) of Domestic Violence\nAct.\n\n4. Petitioner/accused was arrested and produced before this court on 26.12.2024.\nSince then he has been in judicial custody. Thus this petition.\n\n5. Areport was called for from SHO, Mannanthala police station. Report filed by\nthe SHO Mannanthala Police Station dated 09.01.2025 stating that the investi-\ngation in the above case is going on and if accused is enlarged on bail he may\nflee from justice and also there is a chance that the evidence will be tampered.\n\n6. Heard both sides. The following point has arisen for consideration ?\n\nIs the petitioner /accused entitled to be released on bail ?\n\n7. Point :- The learned counsel for the petitioner / accused submitted that the al-\nlegations of prosecution false and because of the family disputes that exist be-\ntween the accused and the informant, she now lodged the FIR. The learned\ncounsel further contented that he is in custody for three weeks.\n\n8. The learned Assistant Public Prosecutor argued that the offences alleged\nagainst the accused is serious in nature and he has serious similar criminal an-\ntecedents. The learned APP further submitted that accused committed viola-\ntion of the protection order earlier also and that case is still pending. Since the\ninvestigation is at the initial stage, and his custody is required hence this appli-\ncation has to be rejected.\n\n9. In Dataram Singh v. State of UP 2018(1)KHC 901 the Honourable Apex\nCourt held that “Yet another important facet of our criminal\njurisprudence is that the grant of bail is the general rule and putting a\nperson in jail or in a prison or in a correction home (whichever expression\none may wish to use) is an exception. Unfortunately, some of these basic\nprinciples appear to have been lost sight of with the result that more and\nmore persons are being incarcerated and for longer periods. This does not\ndo any good to our criminal jurisprudence or to our society.\n\nThere is no doubt that the grant or denial of bail is entirely the discretion\n\n3\nof the Judge considering a case but even so, the exercise of judicial\ndiscretion has been circumscribed by a large number of decisions\nrendered by this Court and by every High Court in the country. Yet,\noccasionally there is a necessity to introspect whether denying bail to an\naccused person is the right thing to do on the facts and in the\ncircumstances of a case”.\n\n10. In XXXX v. State of Kerala 2024 KHC 1267 the Honourable Apex Court\nheld that “In bail applications, generally, it has been laid down from the\nearliest times that, the object of bail is to secure the appearance of the\naccused person at his trial by reasonable amount of bail. The object of bail\nis neither punitive nor preventive. Deprivation of liberty must be\nconsidered a punishment, unless it is required to ensure that an accused\nperson will stand his trial when called upon. The courts owe more than\nverbal respect to the principle that punishment begins after conviction,\nand that every man is deemed to be innocent until duly tried and duly\nfound guilty”.\n\n11.1 have heard the contentions of both parties. As per the report, recovery has\nbeen effected. The earlier bail application filed by the accused/ petitioner was\ndismissed vide order in CMP No. 1567/2024 dated 28.12.2024. As per the\nprosecution records now the final report has been filed by the police and there\nis change in circumstances. Considering the facts and circumstances of the\ncase, this court is of the view that further detention of the accused in the\njudicial custody is not required. Hence he can be released on bail.\n\n12. As a result, the Accused /petitioner is released on bail on the following\nstringent conditions:-\n\n1. Accused /petitioner is released on bail on executing a bail bond of\n~.50,000/- with two solvent sureties each for like sum.\n\n2. Accused /petitioner shall not commit any offences while he is on bail.\n\n3. Accused /petitioner shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement,\n\n4\nthreat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so\nas to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the court or police offi-\ncer or tamper with the evidence.\n4. If any of the conditions are violated the bail granted hereby will be can-\ncelled.\nDictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected by me and\npronounced by me in open court on this the 9\" day of January, 2025.\n//True copy//\nSd/-\nJudicial First Class Magistrate-V,\nThiruvananthapuram.\n\n"
