The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: The Accused was the rider\nof Tipper Lorry bearing Registration No. KL 20 E 1202. He drove the vehicle from\nStationkadavu to Pallithura rashly, negligently and in such a manner as to\nendanger human life through Stationkadavu-Pallithura road about 3.00 AM on\n16.07.2016 and hit the motor cycle bearing Registration No. KL 16Q 3925 driven\nby the since deceased, with CW2 as the pillion rider. Due to its impact, the since\ndeceased and CW2 fell on the road. Since deceased sustained grievous injuries on\nhis head, chest and body who succumbed to his injuries at the Govt. Medical\nCollege Hospital, while undergoing treatment. CW2 also sustained injuries on his\nface, both cheeks, left knee and fracture on the bone of his right leg. Thus, the\nAccused is alleged to have committed the above stated offences.\n3. On the basis of the Final Report, the cognizance was taken for the offences\nunder Section 279, 337, 338 and 304 A of the IPC and summons was issued to the\nAccused herein. On issuance of process, the Accused entered appearance and he\nwas enlarged on bail. He was represented by a Counsel of his own choice. Copies\nof all the Prosecution records were furnished to him. The particulars of offences\nunder Sections 279,337, 338 and 304A of the IPC were read over and explained to\nthe Accused and he understood the same, to which he pleaded not guilty and\nclaimed to be tried.\n4. From the side of Prosecution, CWs 1, 2, 4, 5 and 20 were examined as PWs1\nto 5 and Exhibits P1 to P11 were marked. The Prosecution failed to procure the\n\n3 of 7\npresence of CW3, and steps under Section 82 CrPC was effected against him. The\nProsecution evidence was closed. The Accused was examined under section 313(1)\n(b) of the CrPC. He denied all the incriminating evidence against him and claimed\ninnocence. No evidence was adduced by the Defence.\n5. Heard both sides and perused relevant documents. The following points\narise for consideration.\na. Has the Accused driven his vehicle rashly, negligently and in a\nmanner likely to endanger human life and thereby committed the offence\npunishable under Section 279 of the IPC as alleged?\nb. Has the Accused by his act of having driven the vehicle in rash or\nnegligent manner caused hurt to since deceased and PW2, thereby\ncommitted the offence punishable u/S. 337 IPC as alleged?\nCc. Has the Accused by so driving the aforesaid vehicle caused grievous\nhurt to the Deceased driven the aforesaid vehicle grievous hurt to since\ndeceased and PW2, thereby committed the offence punishable u/S. 338 of\nthe IPC as alleged?\nd. Has the Accused driven his vehicle rashly, negligently and in a\nmanner likely to endanger human life, resulting in the since deceased to\nsuccumb to his injuries and thereby committed the offence punishable under\nSection 304 A of the IPC as alleged?\ne. If so, what shall be the proper sentence?\n6. Points (a) to (d): These points are considered together for the sake of\nbrevity and to avoid repetition.\n\n4 of 7\n\nPW1 deposed that the since deceased is his nephew and that PW2, his son.\nHe deposed that he was informed of the incident over phone. He gave Exhibit P1\nstatement to the police.\n\nPW2 deposed that he sustained injury in the incident and that since\ndeceased is his cousin, who had driven the motor cycle. According to him the\nincident occurred in Thumba due to the negligence of the lorry, but denied his\nhaving given statement to the police as regards the driver and number of the lorry.\n\nPW3, deposed to have witnessed the inquest proceedings of since deceased\nand having attested Exhibit P2 Inquest Report. PW4, also deposed to that effect\nand subsequently denied his signature.\n\nPW4, is the Investigating Officer. He deposed that he registered Exhibit P3\nFIR on the basis of the Exhibit P1 Statement, prepared Exhibit P2 Inquest Report,\nExhibit P3 Scene Mahazar, Exhibit P5 Seizure Mahazar to the effect of seizure of\nthe alleged offending vehicle. Further he deposed to have prepared Exhibit P6\nReport reflecting the name and address of the Accused, whose arrest was recorded\nand who was enlarged on bail. Exhibit P7 report reflecting addition of offence\npunishable under Section 338 of the IPC was also prepared by him. He also\ndeposed that the vehicles involved were inspected by the AMVIs and Exhibits P8\nand P9 are reports to that effect, and the Exhibit P10 is the scene plan prepared by\nthe Village Officer. Further, he also identified the Postmortem Certificate marked\nas Exhibit P11 (subject to proof) sent over to him and produce before the Court.\nPW4, during the cross-examination admitted that the vehicle driven by the since\ndeceased did not have a valid license as on the date of the incident.\n\nThe Learned Counsel for the Accused submits that the Prosecution could not\nsubstantiate its case that it was on account of the alleged negligence or rashness\nof the Accused that the alleged incident occurred. The fact that since deceased did\n\n5 of 7\n\nnot have a valid license as on the alleged date of incident has also to be taken into\nconsideration. PW2, the other injured, though deposed that the accident occurred\non account of the negligence of the lorry, he has neither identified the alleged lorry\nnor the Accused as its driver. The Learned APP points out that the offending\nvehicle has been seized and report also filed and further that merely because PW5\ndeposed that since deceased did not have valid license, that the accident occurred\ndue to the negligence of the since deceased.\n\nThis Court has carefully considered the materials placed on records and the\nsubmissions of the Learned APP and the Learned Counsel for the Accused. As\nrightly pointed out by the Accused, there are no independent evidence to prove the\ncomplicity of the Accused in the alleged incident. The injured witness turned\nhimself against the case of Prosecution. Though he deposed to the effect that\nincident occurred due to the negligence of the lorry, he denied direct knowledge to\nthe same and denied to have identified the Accused and the vehicle. It is true that\nmerely because PW5 deposed that since deceased did not have valid license, it\ncannot be said that the accident occurred due to the negligence of the since\ndeceased. However, it is to be noted that the Prosecution has failed to discharge\nits initial burden to prove the negligence, rashness on the part of the Accused,\nespecially on account of the testimonies of the witnesses and absence of proof of\nmedical evidence. There is nothing on record so as to implicate the Accused to the\nalleged incident. Hence, this Court finds that the Prosecution failed to substantiate\nits case beyond reasonable doubt. These points are therefore answered in favour of\nthe Accused.\n\n7. Point (e): In light of analysis of the points hereinabove, since those are\nfound against the Prosecution, question of sentencing the Accused does not arise.\n\n8. In the result, the Accused is found not guilty of having committed the\noffence punishable under Sections 279, 337, 338 and 304 A of the IPC. Hence, the\n\n6 of 7\nAccused is acquitted of the said offences under section 255(1) of the CrPC. His bail\nbond stands canceled and he is set at liberty.\n(Dictated to my Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected by\nme and pronounced in open court on this, the 27™ day of January, 2025)\nJudicial Magistrate of First Class-I\nThiruvananthapuram\nAPPENDIX\nA:Prosecution witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\n‘witness, Other witness\n7\non\nNazarudheen(CW2) Injured witness\nPwo iK P Purushothaman(CW20) Police Witness\nB:Defence witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nC:Court witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\n\n7 of 7\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA.
