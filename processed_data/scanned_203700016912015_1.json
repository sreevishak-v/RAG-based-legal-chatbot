No.638/2014 on the file of\nAdditional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court (Economic\nOffences), Ernakulam, on the basis of settlement under\nSection 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\n2. It is alleged in the petition that the first\npetitioner married the second respondent and they were\nliving together as husband and wife. Petitioners 2 and 3 are\nthe father and mother of the first petitioner. There was\nsome misunderstanding arose between them and on\naccount of the same, they started residing separately and\nthe second respondent filed Crl.M.P.1946/2012 alleging\noffence under Section 498A read with Section 34 of the\nIndian Penal Code, which was forwarded to the police by\nthe learned magistrate and on that basis Annexure-A1 first\ninformation report was registered as Crime No.1570/2012\n\n—\n2015/KER/I7315\nCri. M.C. No.1691 of 2015\n2\nof Ernakulam Town South Police station. After investigation\nfinal report was filed and it was taken on file as C.C.No.\n638/2014 on the file of the Additional Chief Judicial\nMagistrate Court (Economic Offences), Ernakulam. Now\nthe matter has been settled between the parties in the\nmediation held and they have decided to separate and on\naccount of the settlement, second respondent does not want\nto prosecute the case. In view of the settlement, there is no\npossibility of conviction. Since the offence alleged is non-\ncompoundable in nature, they cannot move the lower court\nfor this purpose. So in view of the settlement, conviction is\nremote. So the petitioner has no other remedy except to\napproach this court, seeking the following relief:\n“This Hon'ble Court may be pleased to quash\n\nAnnexure-Al FIR in Crime No.1570/2012 of Ernakulam\n\nTown South Police Station and its further proceedings\n\npending as C.C.No.638/2014 before the Additional Chief\n\nJudicial Magistrate Court(EO), Ernakulam, so as to\n\nsecure the ends of justice”.\n\n3. Second respondent appeared through\n\ncounsel and submitted that, the matter has been settled and\n\nae\n.\n2015/KER/17315\nCri. M.C. No.1691 of 2015 ;\nshe has no objection in quashing the proceedings. Second\nrespondent has filed Annexure-III affidavit stating these\nfacts.\n\n4. The counsel for the petitioner also submitted\nthat, in view of the settlement, there is no possibility of\nconviction. So he prayed for allowing the application.\n\n5. The application was opposed by the Public\nProsecutor.\n\n6. It is an admitted fact that first petitioner\nmarried the second respondent and on the basis of a private\ncomplaint filed, which was forwarded to the _ police,\nAnnexure-Al crime was registered and after investigation\nfinal report was filed and it was taken on file as\nC.C.No0.638/2014 before the Additional Chief Judicial\nMagistrate Court (Economic Offences), Ernakulam, alleging\noffence under Section 498A read with Section 34 of the\nIndian Penal Code against the petitioners. Now the matter\nhas been settled between the parties evidenced by\n\n.\n2015/KER/17315\n\nCri. M.C. No.1691 of 2015 ,\nAnnexure-A2, when the case was referred to mediation in\nM.C.298/2014, pending before the Family Court, Ernakulam\nand on that basis they have decided to separate and joint\npetition for divorce has been agreed to be filed. In view of\nthe settlement, second respondent did not want to\nprosecute the case and she filed Annexure-A3 affidavit\nstating these facts and expressing her willingness to quash\nthe proceedings on the basis of settlement. In view of the\nsettlement there is no possibility of conviction, as neither\nthe defacto-complainant nor her witnesses will support the\ncase of the prosecution. Allowing the case to proceed will\nonly amount to wastage of judicial time.\n\n7. Further in the decision reported in Gian\nSingh v. State of Panjab [2012(4) KLT 108 (SC)], the\nSupreme Court has held that, in cases of private disputes\nand matrimonial disputes which resulted in registering of\ncrime and filing of final report and if the matter has been\nsettled due to the intervention of mediators, then, even if\n\n2015/KER/17315\n\nCri. M.C. No.1691 of 2015 ;\n\nnon-compoundable offences have been incorporated, court\n\nhas to invoke the power under Section 482 of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure to quash the proceedings in order to\nhonour the settlement and harmony that has been reached\namong the family members on account of the intervention of\n\nthe well-wishers of both the parties.\n\n8. Considering the fact that, it is a matrimonial\ndispute, which resulted in registration of the crime and\nfiling of final report and the matter has been settled\nbetween the parties and on account of the settlement,\npossibility of conviction is remote and allowing the case to\nproceed will only amount to wastage of judicial time, this\ncourt feels that, it is a fit case where the power under\nSection 482 can be invoked to quash the proceedings to\npromote the settlement and harmony that has been resulted\nin the two families due to the intervention of the mediators.\n\nSo the application is allowed and _ further\nproceedings in C.C.No.638/2014 (Crime No.1570/2012 of\n\n—\n2015/KER/I7315\nCri.
