KEMAL PASHA, J.\nCRL.M.C. Nos. 5769 & 5781 of 2017,\nORDER\n\nThere was a delay in filing income tax return in these\nmatters. According to the petitioners, the delay was not\nwillful; whereas, the Department says that the delay was\nwillful. According to the Department, the delay was willful in\nthe sense that it was also a modus operandi to avoid the\npayment of tax. The learned counsel for the petitioners has\npointed out that the petitioners were suffering from utter\nfinancial stringency and therefore, the return could not be\nfiled in time. The return could be filed only on uploading the\npayment of the admitted tax. They were not in a position to\npay the admitted tax and that is the reason why the delay\nhad occurred.\n\n2. Huge amounts were imposed on the petitioners\nas penalty. Of course, in case of such willful delay, and\n\n2017/KER/49759\nCRL.M.C.Nos. 5769 & 5781 of 2017 uoe\nconcealment of income, it is for the Department to take such\nmeasures.\n\n3. Now, an appeal has been filed and the matter is\npending adjudication. In the mean time, the petitioners had\napproached this Court and the matters in the appeal stands\nstayed by the orders of this Court as is evident from\nAnnexure N in Crl.M.C. No.5769 of 2017. In a similar\nsituation this Court had occasion to pass Annexure O order\nin Cri.M.C.No.5769/2017. In this particular situation, this\nCourt is of the view that the prosecution proceedings before\nthe court below in these matters shall stand stayed, till the\ndisposal of the appeal.\n\nIn the result, these Crl.M.Cs. are disposed of by\nordering that the prosecution proceedings before the court\nbelow in these matters shall stand stayed till the disposal of\nthe appeal.\n\nSd/- B. KEMAL PASHA, JUDGE.\nul/-\n// true copy //\nPS. to Judge.\n\n"
