C.S. HRITHWIK, PUBLIC PROSECUTOR\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n04.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nop a\n2024/KER/407\nCRL.MC NO. 33 OF 2024\n2\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.\n~ CrLLM.C.No.33 of 2024\nDated this the 4\" day of January, 2024\nORDER\n\nPetitioner challenges Annexure Al order issued by the Sub\nDivisional Magistrate, Fort Kochi under Section 111 of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure, 1973 (for short, 'the Cr.P.C.'). As per the impugned\norder, the learned Sub Divisional Magistrate recorded that he is prima\nfacie convinced that the petitioner herein causes threat to the public\npeace and tranquility and security proceedings under Section 107 of the\nCr.P.C. are liable to be initiated against him.\n\n2. Sri.M.A.Ahammad Saheer, the learned counsel for the petitioner\nvehemently contended that the procedure carried out by the learned Sub\nDivisional Magistrate is wrong in law especially since except one case, all\nother cases referred to in Annexure Al have either been compounded or\nsettled and therefore those cases cannot be relied upon to invoke\nproceedings under Section 107 of the Cr.P.C. or issue an order under\nSection 111 of the Cr.P.C. It is further submitted that the report of the\nInvestigating Officer to the learned Sub Divisional Magistrate was on\n12.03.2022 while the impugned order was issued only on 20.05.2023.\n\n3. I have heard Sri.M.A.Ahammad Saheer, the learned counsel for\nthe petitioner as well as Sri.C.S.Hrithwik, the learned Public Prosecutor.\n\nBREN:\n2024/KER/407\nCRL.MC NO. 33 OF 2024\n3\n\n4. The impugned order is issued under Section 111 of the Cr.P.C.\nThe said order is only the beginning of an enquiry proceeding under\nSection 116 of the Cr.P.C. Petitioner will have all the opportunity to\ncontrovert the prima facie observations of the learned Sub Divisional\nMagistrate as recorded in Annexure Al in the enquiry proceedings.\nFurther, it is noticed that the impugned order is issued on 20.05.2023\nwhile this Crl.M.C.is filed after almost 7 months, though the petitioner has\na case that the order was served on him only recently.\n\n5. Be that as it may, as the order under Section 111 of the Cr.P.C.\nis subject to an enquiry proceedings to be carried out under Section 116\nof the Cr.P.C., this Court is of the view that petitioner has sufficient\nremedy available under law to bring to the notice of the learned\nMagistrate the entire contention that he intends to take.\n\n6. Since the petitioner has an effective opportunity as per the\nprovisions of Section 116 of the Cr.P.C., there is no merit in this Crl.M.C.\nand the same is dismissed.\n\nThe contentions raised by the petitioner in this Crl.M.C. are kept\nopen to be raised before the learned Sub Divisional Magistrate during the\nenquiry proceedings.\n\nSd/-\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, JUDGE\nRKM\n\nBue\n2024/KER/407\nCRL.MC NO. 33 OF 2024\n4\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 33/2024\n\nPETITIONER'S ANNEXURES :\n\nAnnexure Al TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER DATED 20.05.2023\nIN M.C.NO.543/2022 PASSED BY THE SUB\nDIVISIONAL MAGISTRATE FORT-KOCHTI\n\nAnnexure A2 TRUE COPY OF THE JUDGMENT DATED\n04.11.2017 IN ST NO. 4913/2016 ON THE\nFILES OF JFCM-I, ALUVA\n\nAnnexure A3 TRUE COPY OF THE JUDGMENT DATED\n23.11.2023 IN CC NO.893/2022 ON THE FILES\nOF JFCM-I, ALUVA\n\nAnnexure A4 TRUE COPY OF THE JUDGMENT DATED\n20.02.2018 IN CC NO.154/2018 ON THE FILES\nOF JFCM-I, ALUVA\n\nAnnexure A5 TRUE COPY OF THE JUDGMENT DATED\n27.06.2019 IN CC NO.558/2015 ON THE FILES\nOF JFCM-I, ALUVA\n\nAnnexure A6 TRUE COPY OF THE JUDGMENT DATED\n09.02.2023 IN CC NO.901/2020 ON THE FILES\nOF JFCM-I, ALUVA\n\nAnnexure A7 TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER OF THIS HON'BLE\nCOURT DATED 01.02.2016 IN\nCRL.M.C.NO.385/2016\n\nAnnexure A8 TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER DATED 25.10.2016\nOF THIS HON'BLE COURT IN\nCRL.M.C.NO.3377/2016\n\n"
