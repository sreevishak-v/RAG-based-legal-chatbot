This is a case charge sheeted by the Sub Inspector of Police, Pettah Police\nStation in crime No. 1851/2017 against the accused, 14 in numbers, alleging\ncommission of offences u/s 143, 147, 149, 294(b), 323, 447 and 427 of IPC.\nCognizance is not taken for the offence punishable u/s 294(b) of IPC.\n\n2. The prosecution case in brief is that on 19/11/2017 at about 5.45 pm, the\naccused formed themselves into an unlawful assembly and in prosecution of\ntheir common object, criminally trespassed into the Ayappa Thavalam inside\nthe property of CW1 near Karikkakam SNDP Sakha Guru Mandiram and\ncommitted mischief by destructing the tube light, utensils and chairs thereby\ncausing loss to the tune of %.5,000/-. When CW1 questioned the accused, the\n1* accused pushed her down thereby causing injury and hurt to her. The\naccused thereby committed the offences as alleged against them.\n\n3. All accused appeared on summons and they were furnished with copies of all\nrelevant prosecution records. After hearing, particulars of the offences u/s\n143, 147, 149, 323, 447 and 427 of IPC were read over and explained to them\nand they pleaded not guilty.\n\n4. To prove their case, the prosecution examined CW1 and CW2 as PW1 and\nand PW2 and marked a document as Ext.P1. Since the witnesses examined\ndid not support the prosecution, CW3 to CW12 were given up by the learned\n\n4\nAPP. Hence, the prosecution evidence was closed. As there were no\nincriminating circumstances brought out in evidence against accused,\nexamination u/s 313 of Cr.P.C was not necessary. The accused did not adduce\nany evidence.\n\n5. Heard both the sides.\n\n6. The points that arise for consideration are:-\n\n1. Whether the accused Nos. 1 to 14 had committed the offences\npunishable u/s 143, 147, 149, 323, 447 and 427 of IPC, as alleged?\n2. What shall be the sentence or order?\n\n7. Point No.1 :- The evidence in this case consists of depositions of 2\nwitnesses and 1 document from the side of the prosecution. PW1 deposed\naffirming the incident, but she stated that she was not assaulted. She admitted\nher signature in Ext.P1, but categorically stated that she could not identify any\nof the accused. PW2 cited as occurrence witness denied having witnessed the\nalleged incident. Since the material witnesses turned hostile to prosecution,\nthe learned Assistant Public Prosecutor gave up the remaining witnesses.\nFrom the above evidence, there is nothing to prove the occurrence as alleged\nor to connect the accused with the offences. Thus, the prosecution failed to\nprove that the accused committed the offences u/s 143, 147, 149, 323, 447 and\n427 of IPC. Point No.1 is found against the prosecution.\n\n8. Point No.2 :- In view of my finding on point no.1, the accused Nos.1 to 14\nare found not guilty of the offences punishable u/s 143, 147, 149, 323, 447\nand 427 of IPC they are acquitted u/s 255(1) of CrPC and set at liberty,\ncancelling their bail bonds.\n\n5\nProperty produced in this case as T 408/2017, broken piece of tube light,\nbeing valueless, shall be destroyed.\nDictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected\nand pronounced by me in open Court on this the 28\" day of February 2025.\n¢\nElsa Catherine George\nAdditional Chief Judicial Magistrate\nKos > | Thiruvananthapuram\nf8/_ Ex e \\\nmi MS aA St is\nz Gs EB )\n; Cems .\n\n6\nAPPENDIX\nWitnesses for Prosecution\nPW1 Maheshwari\nPW2 Rajamma\nExhibits for Prosecution\nPl FI Statement dated 19/11/2017 by PW1\nWitnesses and Exhibits for the defence\nNIL\nMaterial Objects\nNIL\n¢\n32\nElsa Catherine George,\nAdditional Chief Judicial Magistrate,\nThiruvananthapuram.\n| Fessler ON .\nO/ Gea \\e\\\nCy a\n\n"
