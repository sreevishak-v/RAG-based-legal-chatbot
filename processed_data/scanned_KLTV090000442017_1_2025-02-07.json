There is nothing on record as revealed\nfrom the deposition of the witnesses so as to implicate the Accused to the alleged\nincident that the Accused had driven the bus in a rash and negligent manner,\ncausing the injured to succumb to his injuries. Nothing has been brought out in\nevidence to the effect to prove the ingredients of the offences alleged. The\nProsecution has failed to substantiate its case by adducing proper evidence and\nthereby failed to prove the guilt of the Accused beyond reasonable doubt. Hence\nPoints (a) and (b) are found in favour of the Accused.\n\n5\n9.
