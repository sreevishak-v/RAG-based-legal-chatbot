This case has been arisen on a final report filed by the Sub Inspector of Police,\n\n3\nCantonment Police Station in crime No. 1395/2016 alleging the commission of\noffences against the accused under Sections 143,147,149,341, 294(b) and 323\nof the Indian Penal Code.\n\n2. The prosecution case in brief _is_as follows:- Accused due to the enmity\ntowards the informant on 07.11.2016 at 03.15 pm near University College,\nSpencer Junction, Palayam ward, Vanchiyoor village, formed themselves into\nan unlawful assembly, each of them knowing well aware that they were the\nmembers of said unlawful assembly, accused no. 1 uttered obscene words\nagainst the informant and accused no.2 wrongfully restrained him . Accused\nno. 1 voluntarily caused hurt to the informant by fisted on his lips with his\nhand and htting on his left shoulder and accused nos. 3 to 5 hitting and\nbeating on the various parts of his body, causing pain. Thereafter,Thereby the\naccused alleged to have committed the offences punishable under Sections\n143,147,149,341, 294(b) and 323 of the Indian Penal Code.\n\n3. On the submission of final report by Sub Inspector of Police, Cantonment\nPolice Station, cognizance was taken by this court for the offences under\nsections 143,147,149,341, 294(b) and 323 of the Indian Penal Code. The case\nwas taken on file as C.C 348/2017 against accused. Copies of relevant records\nof the prosecution case and thereby complied with the mandate under section\n207 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. On hearing the learned Assistant\nPublic Prosecutor and the learned counsel for the accused and on perusal of\nfinal report and documents sent with it under section 173 of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure, 1973. Thereafter, the accused nos. 3 to 5 were heard on\nthe charge levelled against them. Particulars of offence under Sections\n143,147,149,341, 294(b) and 323 of the Indian Penal Code, read over them and\nthey pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.\n\n4. In the light of the denial of charge framed against accused nos. 3 to 5, the\nprosecution was directed to adduce evidence to prove the charge against\naccused. The prosecution cited witness Nos.1 to 7 in support of the prosecution\n\n4\n\ncase and as a first step for the prosecution evidence summons were issued to\nprosecution witnesses. In response of it, the prosecution witness No.1\nappeared and was examined as PW1 and Ext.P1 was marked through PW1.\nPW1 was examined from the side of prosecution and he turned hostile. After\nthe examination of PW1, as the evidence of the remaining witnesses by itself\nwould not improve the prosecution case, remaining charge witnesses were\ngiven up by the learned Assistant Public Prosecutor and the prosecution\nevidence was closed. Since there was no incriminating circumstances\nappearing in evidence against accused Nos. 3 to 5, examination of accused\nNos. 3 to 5, under Section 313 (1) (b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973\nwere dispensed with.\n\n5. No defence evidence from the side of the accused persons.\n\n6. Heard both sides.\n\n7. The point that arise for consideration are as follows:\n\n1 Did the accused Nos. 3 to 5, on 07.11.2016 at 03.15 pm near\nUniversity College, Spencer Junction, Palayam ward, Vanchiyoor\nvillage , in furtherance of common object, form themselves into an\nunlawful assembly and thus alleged to have committed offence under\nSection 143 read with 149 of the Indian Penal Code?\n\n2 Did the accused Nos. 3 to 5, on 07.11.2016 at 03.15 pm near\nUniversity College, Spencer Junction, Palayam ward, Vanchiyoor\nvillage, in furtherance of common object, and commit rioting and thus\nalleged to have committed offence under Section 147 read with 149 of\nthe Indian Penal Code?\n\n3 Did the accused Nos. 3 to 5, on 07.11.2016 at 03.15 pm near\nUniversity College, Spencer Junction, Palayam ward, Vanchiyoor\nvillage, in furtherance of common object, wrongfully restrain witness\nno. 1 in the final report and thus alleged to have committed offence\n\n5\nunder Section 341 read with 149 of the Indian Penal Code?\n\n4 Did the accused Nos. 3 to 5, on 07.11.2016 at 03.15 pm near\nUniversity College, Spencer Junction, Palayam ward, Vanchiyoor\nvillage, in furtherance of common object, voluntarily cause hurt to\nwitness no. 1 in the final report and thus alleged to have committed\noffence under Section 323 read with 149 of Indian Penal Code?\n\n5 Did the accused Nos. 3 to 5, 07.11.2016 at 03.15 pm near University\nCollege, Spencer Junction, Palayam ward, Vanchiyoor village, in\nfurtherance of common object,utter obscene words against witness\nno. 1 in the final report and thus alleged to have committed an offence\nunder section 294(b) read with 149 of the Indian Penal Code?\n\n6 Ifthe accused found guilty, what is the order as to sentence?\n\n8. Point Nos.1 to 5:- For the sake of convenience, point Nos.1 to 5 are to be\nconsidered together. PW1- Midhun is the informant in this case. PW1\ndeposed that regarding the incident, he had given statement to the Police and\nthe First Information Statement was marked as Ext.P1. He admitted his\nsignature in Ext.P1 First Information Statement.But he turned hostile to the\nprosecution and deposed that he could not identify the person who attacked\nhim.\n\n9. In the view of evidence of PW1 and non examination of remaining\nprosecution witnesses, there is no incriminating circumstance appearing in\nevidence against the accused, hence examination of accused no. 3 to 5 under\nsection 313 (1) (b) of Cr.P.C was dispensed with.\n\n10.0n the backdrop of above discussion and in the view of evidence of\nprosecution witnesses, I find that the prosecution has failed to establish the\noffence alleged against the accused no. 3 to 5 beyond reasonable doubt. Hence,\n\n6\nthese points were found against the prosecution.\n10.Point no. 6:-In view of my findings on Point Nos.1 to 5, it is found that the\naccused no. 3 to 5 are found not guilty for the offences punishable under\nsections 143,147,149,341, 294(b) and 323 of the Indian Penal Code\n11.In the result, the accused nos. 3 to 5 are found not guilty and acquitted under\nsection 255(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for the offences under\nSections 143,147,149,341, 294(b) and 323 of the Indian Penal Code. The bail\nbonds of accused stand cancelled and they are set at liberty. Case against\naccused nos. 1 and 2 is split up and refiled as CC No.434/2025\n(Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected and\npronounced by me, in open court, on this the 27\" day of February,2025).\nSd/-\nJudicial Magistrate of the First Class— II\nThiruvananthapuram\nAPPENDIX\nWitnesses for Prosecution:\nPW1/CW1: Midhun, informant examined on 13.02.25\nExihibit for Prosecution:\nP1 : ELS dated 07.11.16 proved by PW1\nWitness for Defence: Nil\nExihibit for Defence: Nil\nMaterial Objects: Nil\nSd/-\nJudicial Magistrate of the First Class— III\nThiruvananthapuram\n/fTrue Copy//\n\n"
