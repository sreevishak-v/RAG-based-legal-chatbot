According to the prosecution, the petitioners herein formed\nan unlawful assembly and in prosecution of their common object,\ntrespassed into the house of the de facto complainant on 5.11.2018 at\nabout 5.30 p.m. and attacked her husband and other family members\nwith weapons. It is also alleged that mischief was committed by the\naccused causing a loss to the tune of Rs.1,79,000/-.\n\n3. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would\nsubmit that the petitioner as well as the de facto complainant and\nothers are near relatives. Only minor injuries were sustained by the\nvictims. Without taking note of the nature of injuries, the\ninvestigating officer has incorporated Section 307 of the IPC. Itis\nfurther contended that parties were litigating in the civil court in\nrespect of a pathway leading to the property of the petitioners.\nAccording to the learned counsel, in the course of proceedings, the\n\note\nCrLMC:8856/18 4 2019/KER/1251\nentire disputes have been settled and the parties are now living in\npeace and harmony. The de facto complainant and the other injured\nhave filed separate affidavits before this court asserting that they\nhave no subsisting grievance and they have no objection in\nterminating the criminal proceedings.\n\n4. The learned counsel appearing for the party respondents\nwould contend that the crime was registered due to _ the\ncircumstances prevailing then. It is submitted that the entire\ndisputes have been settled and the party respondents have no further\ngrievance.\n\n5. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted\nthat the statements of the victims have been recorded and they have\nstated in unmistakable terms that they have no further grievance.\n\n6. Ihave considered the submissions advanced and have gone\nthrough the statement of the witnesses and also the wound\ncertificate. Except for one Mary Kutty Kurian, the other witnesses\nhave sustained only contusions. Mary Kutty Kurian has suffered a\nlacerated wound in the occipital region of the scalp, which injury\n\note\nCrLMC:8856/18 5 2019/KER/1251\ncannot be said to be serious.\n\n7. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303]\nand in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466], the\nApex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the High Court\ncan take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the\nvictim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings.\n\n8. The offence committed by the petitioners cannot be said to\nbe grave and serious having ingredients of extreme mental depravity.\nThough Section 307 has also been incorporated, the injury sustained\ncannot in any way be regarded as serious. The parties are members\nof the same family and they have managed to iron out their entire\ndisputes and to live in peace and harmony. It also does not appear\nthat the offence in this case will have a serious impact on the society.\nIt is felt that quashing of proceedings on account of compromise\nwould bring about peace and secure the ends of justice. Even\notherwise, persisting with the prosecution would be nothing but a\nwaste of time as the prospects of conviction is bleak. Having\nconsidered all the relevant circumstances, I am of the considered\nview that this Court will be well justified in invoking its extraordinary\n\nBerl\n\niene\n\nBle a\nCrl.MC:8856/18 6 201/KER/1ISI1\npowers under Section 482 of the Code to quash the proceedings.\n\nIn the result, this petition will stand allowed.
