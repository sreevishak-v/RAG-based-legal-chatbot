The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: On 14.11.2001 at 7.30 pm,\nthe Accused Persons due to prior animosity towards CW1, in prosecution of their\ncommon object to voluntary cause hurt the Informant and others formed\nthemselves into an unlawful assembly, carrying dangerous weapons like sword\nand short sticks and committed riot at a place near Edapazhinji Junction and\nfurther, the 1%‘ Accused hit Informant with a short stick, the 2\"? Accused caused\ninjury to the Informant on his left knee by means of a sword and 3™ to 6\" Accused\nhit on several parts of his body causing pain to the Informant. Thus, the accused\nare alleged to have committed the above mentioned offences.\n3. On the basis of the Final Report, the cognizance was taken for the offences\nunder Sections 143, 147, 148,149, 323, 324 of the IPC and 27 of Arms Act and\nsummons was issued to the Accused Persons. This case was initially filed before\nthe Court of the Hon’ble Chief Judicial Magistrate, Thiruvananthapuram taken on\nfile as CC 56/2003 and subsequently made over to this Court, refiled as C.C. No.\n\n3\n385/2003. The cognizance was taken on the Final Report in respect of all the\nabove offences. The Accused 1 to 4 and 6 were acquitted under Section 248(1) of\nCrPC vide Judgment of this Court dated 29.09.2004. The case against the present\nAccused, i.e., the 5% Accused was split up and refiled as C.C. No. 1241/2015 on\nhis arrest and production. He was enlarged on bail and he was represented by a\nCounsel of his choice. Copies of relevant Prosecution records were furnished to\nhim. After hearing both parties and on perusing relevant records, charge was\nframed for offences under Sections 143, 147, 148,149, 323, 324 of the IPC and 27\nof Arms Act. It was read over and explained to the Accused and he understood the\nsame, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.\n4. From the side of Prosecution, CWs1, 3,4, 5, 6, 7 were examined as PW1 to\nPW6 respectively and Exhibits P1 to P3 were marked. CW2 was reported to have\nbeen expired and his Death Certificate also produced. The presence of CW8 could\nnot be procured by the Prosecution and report filed to the effect that CW8 is not\navailable. The Prosecution gave up the remaining witness as no purpose would\nbe served in examining him when the material witnesses themselves had turned\nagainst the case of the Prosecution and the Prosecution evidence was closed.\nSince no incriminating circumstances arose from the deposition of the witness,\nthe examination of the Accused under Section 313(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure (hereinafter referred to as the ‘CrPC’) was dispensed with. No\nevidence adduced on behalf of the Accused.\n5. Heard both sides and perused relevant documents. The following points\narise for consideration.\n\n4\n\na. Has the 5\" Accused along with other Accused persons, formed themselves\ninto an unlawful assembly and thereby committed offence punishable under\nSection 143 of IPC as alleged?\n\nb. Has the 5\" Accused along with other Accused persons, in prosecution of\ntheir common object, committed rioting and thereby committed offence\npunishable under section 147 of IPC as alleged?\n\nCc. Has the 5\" Accused along with other Accused persons, in prosecution of\ntheir common object, committed rioting with short sticks and sword and\nthereby committed offence punishable under section 148 of IPC as alleged?\n\nd. Has the 5\" Accused along with other Accused persons, in prosecution of\ntheir common object, voluntarily caused hurt to PW1 and others and\nthereby committed the offence punishable under Section 323 of the IPC as\nalleged?\n\ne. Has the 5\" Accused along with other Accused persons, in prosecution of\ntheir common object, voluntarily caused hurt to PW1 and others with sword\nand short sticks and thereby committed offence punishable under Section\n324 of the IPC as alleged?\n\nf. Has the 5\" Accused along with other Accused persons, in prosecution of\ntheir common object, used sword in violation of the Arms Act and thereby\ncommitted offence under Section 27 of arms Act.\n\ng. If so, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded?\n\n6. Points a to f: These points are considered together for the sake of brevity\n\nand to avoid repetition.\n\nPWI1 deposed that he sustained injury in the incident and that he had given\nExhibit P1 statement to the police regarding the incident. He deposed that he is\nunable to identify the assailants. He further deposed that he knows the Accused.\nTo the question put by the Learned APP, he categorically deposed that he doesn’t\n\n5\nintend to proceed the matter further with this Accused and the case with other\nhas Accused already been settled.\n\nPWs 2 to 4 cited as occurrence witnesses turned hostile to the case of\nProsecution, wherein they deposed not to have witnessed the incident and further\ndenied having given a statement to the police officials to that effect. PW5, the\nScene Mahazar witness though admitted his signature in the Exhibit P2 Scene\nMahazar denied to have known the contents therein and further that he was not\npresent at the time when the Mahazar was prepared by the Police officials and\nthat he doesn’t remember at which place he had signed the same. Similarly, PW6\nadmitted to have affixed his signature in Exhibit P3 Recovery Mahazar, but\ndoesn’t know the arm that has been recovered and further that he was not\npresent at the scene of occurrence and the he did not identify the arm to be a\nsword.\n\nOn careful consideration of the materials placed on record and the\nsubmissions of the Learned APP and the Learned Counsel for the Accused, it is\ncrystal clear that there is nothing on record to implicate the involvement of the\nAccused in the above crime. The injured himself has no consistent case. At one\npoint he deposes that he is unable to identify the Accused and later deposes that\nhe does not intend to proceed with the matter. The injured cannot approbate and\nreprobate. Merely for the reason that he knows the Accused, that does not imply\nhis involvement especially when PW1 deposed that he is unable to identify his\nassailants. The occurrence witnesses also turned hostile to the Prosecution. The\ndeposition of the Mahazar witnesses renders the recovery and inspection of the\nalleged scene of occurrence questionable, which is unexplained by the\nProsecution. The remaining witness was given up by the Prosecution as no\npurpose would be served in examining him in the above circumstances. Thus, this\nCourt is of the view that the Prosecution has miserably failed to prove the\ninvolvement of this Accused in the above Crime beyond reasonable doubt.\nTherefore, these points are found in favour of the Accused herein.\n\n6\n\n7. Point _h: In light of analysis of the points hereinabove, since those are\nfound in favour of the Prosecution, question of sentencing the Accused does not\narise.\n\n8. In the result, the Accused is found not guilty of having committed the\noffence punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148,149, 323, 324 of the IPC and 27\nof Arms Act. Hence, the Accused is acquitted of the said offences under section\n248(1) of the CrPC. His bail bond stands canceled and he is set at liberty.\n\nThe Sword recovered as per Exhibit P3 Mahazar and entered in the\nProperty Register of this Court as T. No.29/2003 shall be disposed of in\naccordance with the rules subject to the period of Appeal, and in the event an\nAppeal is preferred, pursuant to its finality thereof.\n\n(Dictated to my Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected by\nme and pronounced in open court on this the 4\" day of November, 2024)\nJudicial Magistrate of First Class-I\nThiruvananthapuram\nAPPENDIX\nA: Prosecution Witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nPW1 Ramesh examined on Injured\n09.05.2019\nPW2 Mohana Chandran Eye Witness\nexamined on 09.05.2019\nPW3 Gopakumar examined on |Eye Witness\n09.05.2019\nPW4 Gopakumar examined on |Eye Witness\n\n7\nPW5 Sasi examined on Mahazar Witness\n15.10.2019\nPW6 Satheesh Kumar examined |Mahazar Witness\non 20.12.2019\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nC: Court witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA.
