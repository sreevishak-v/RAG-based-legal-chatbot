This is a Petition filed by the Petitioner herein to withdraw his earlier plea and\nto allow him to plead guilty to the offence alleged against him.\n2. The Petitioner herein is the sole Accused in the above case facing charges for\nthe offences punishable under Sections 279, 337, 338 of Indian Penal Code\n(hereinafter referred to as ‘the IPC’) and 146 r/w 196 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988\n(hereinafter referred to as the ‘M.V.

The case of the Petitioner is that at the time when the particulars of the\noffences were read over to him, he pleaded not guilty to the offences alleged and\nclaimed to be tried without properly understanding the contents and consequences\n\nthereof due to some confusion. Now the case is posted for examination of the\nProsecution witnesses and the Petitioner intends to plead guilty to the offences\nalleged and that he has come up voluntarily after fully understanding the\nconsequences thereof.

Per contra, the Learned\nCounsel for the Petitioner submits that the plea of the Accused is voluntary and he\nhas clearly submitted the circumstances under which his erstwhile plea has been\nrecorded and there is no prohibition to record the subsequent plea.

I have carefully gone through the materials on record and the considerations\nof the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner and the Learned APP. The specific case of\nthe Petitioner is that he intends to plead guilty to the above offences and that he\npleaded not guilty earlier without properly understanding the contents and\nconsequences thereof due to some confusion. It is settled that when the guilt is\nadmitted by the Accused and the admission is found to be voluntary, there is no\nreason why the Court should not allow him to withdraw his claim to be tried and\nplead guilty. See Suo Motu v State of Kerala, 2023 (2) KHC 178, Santhosh v. State of\nKerala, 2003 KHC 135. Applying the principles in the above decisions, J am unable to\naccept the contention of the Learned APP.
