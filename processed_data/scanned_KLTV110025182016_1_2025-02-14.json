The case is instituted on complaint filed by the complainant alleging the\ncommission of offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable\nInstruments Act.\n\n2. The complainant's case, in brief, is as follows:- The complainant and accused\nare acquainted with each other. The accused was running an internet cafe near\nthe house of the complainant. In the month of October 2015, the accused\napproached the complainant and requested him to advance a loan of\nRs. 2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lakhs only) to meet his urgent financial necessity\nin connection with his business. The accused believed the complainant that\nhe would repay the amount within three weeks. Believing the words of the\naccused the complainant pledged her gold ornaments and _ arranged\nRs. 2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lakhs only) for giving it to the accused. The\nsaid amount was handed over to the accused and in discharge legally\nenforceable debt the accused executed a cheque bearing No. 000009 dated\n01.02.2016 for an amount of Rs. 2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lakhs only) from\nhis account maintained in the Bank of Baroda, Palayam branch,\n\n3\n\nThiruvananthapuram. As assured by the accused the complainant presented the\nsaid cheque for encashment through her banker United Bank of India,\nThiruvananthapuram . The said cheque was returned unpaid for the reason\n“Funds insufficient” and the same was intimated to the complainant as per the\ndishonour memo dated 16.02.2016. The complainant thereafter issued a\nlawyer’s notice dated 27.02.2016 and the same was received on 01.03.2016.\nThe accused neither replied nor repaid the amount covered by the said\ncheque. Hence the act on the part of the accused constituted the offence\npunishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.\n\n3. On the issuance of summons, the accused appeared before the court. The\naccused was furmished with copies of prosecution records and thereby\ncomplied with the mandate under section 207 of the Criminal Procedure Code.\nThereafter, the accused was heard on the charge levelled against him.\nParticulars of offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act was\nread over him, and he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.\n\n4. From the side of the complainant, the complainant examined one witness as\nPWi and marked six documents as Exts.P1 to P6. From the side of the de-\nfence, DW1 and DW2 were examined and Exts. D1 and D2 were marked.\n\n5. On the completion of the complainant’s evidence, the accused was questioned\nunder Section 313 (1) (b) of the Criminal Procedure Code, in which he denied\nall the incriminating circumstances appearing in the prosecution evidence\nagainst him.\n\n6. Heard the learned counsel of the complainant and the learned counsel for the\naccused.\n\n7. The points that arise for determination are as follows:-\n\n1 Whether the accused executed and issued Ext P2 cheque in favour of\nthe complainant ?\n\n2 Whether the Ext P2 cheque was issued in discharge of a legally\nenforceable debt or liability?\n\n4\n3 Whether the accused committed an offence punishable under Section\n138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act?\n4 Ifthe accused is found guilty, what is the order as to sentence?\n\n8. Points No.1 to 3 :- For the sake of convenience these points are to be\nconsidered together. In this case, from the side of the complainant, the\ncomplainant was examined as PW1 and Ext P1 to P6 were marked. From the\nside of the defence DW1 and DW2 were examined and Ext D1 and D2 were\nmarked. On analysing the evidence of PW1, DW1 and DW2 and on perusing\nExt P1 to P6 and D1 and D2 and on hearing both sides.\n\n9. The learned counsel for the complainant filed an argument note and\nconducted a hearing in this case by putting forward the point that the\ncomplainant has discharged his burden in proving the offence under Section\n138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act against the accused. The learned\ncounsel for the PW1 (complainant) submitted that the complainant had given\nevidence in tune with the complaint. During the cross examination, PW1\n(complainant) categorically deposed that the accused and his wife came to her\nresidence and accepted the amount of Rs. 2,00,000 (Rupees Two Lakhs only )\nand executed Ext P2 cheque in favour of PW1 (complainant). The accused\nnot denied that fact. The specific case of the accused through the examination\nof DW1 and DW2 is that he had not issued Ext P2 cheque in favour of PW1\n(complainant). The accused had transaction with DW2 who is the son of\nPW1 (complainant) and due to the instigation of DW2, PW1 filed this\ncomplaint against the accused. The accused was a producer of a Television\nserial and DW2 was working with him as his executive producer. But DW2\ndenied that fact and is was not proved by the accused. The allegation that Ext\nP2 cheque was issued by the accused to DW2_ is a fact within the special\nknowledge of the accused and that is to be proved in accordance with section\n106 of the Indian Evidence Act. The accused neither repaid nor replied after\nreceiving the Ext P4 advocate notice issued by PW1 (complainant).\n\n5\n\n10. The learned counsel for the accused placed the decision of the Hon'ble High\nCourt in Gopakumar P. Vs. B. Anilkumar and Another reported in 2011\n(3) KHC 850 and submitted that as per the decision when accused failed to\nexplain why a reply notice was not sent would weaken the defence case.\nAnother contention is that even though the accused has disputed the\ntransaction he had not denied the cheque and the signature put in Ext P2\ncheque. Then the learned counsel for the PW1 (complainant) placed the\ndecision of Vasanthakumar Vs. Viyakumari reported in 2015 KHC 4332 it is\nheld that if the cheque is admitted and the signature is also admitted the com-\nplainant is entitled to get presumption available under Sections 118 and 139\nof the Negotiable Instruments Act. To buttress the said point the learned\ncounsel placed another decision Kalamani Tex and Another V. P. Balasubra-\nmanyan reported in 2021 (5) SCC 283 and another decision Raju M.\nThomas V. State of Kerala reported in 2021 KHC 3234. Kalamani Tex V.\nSubramanian reported in 2021 (5) SCC 281 In addition to it, the accused\nraised another defence during the cross examination is that the signature and\nwritings in the Ext P2 cheque are different. In Oriental Bank Of Commerce\nVs. Prabodh Kumar Tewari reported in 2022 (4) KLT 1231 it is held that\neven if the details of the cheque have not been filled up by the drawer but by\nanother person that is not relevant to the defence whether the cheque was is-\nsued towards payment of a debt or in discharge of liability. So on going by the\naforesaid facts, evidence and the decisions of Hon’ble Apex Court the learned\ncounsel for the PW1 (complainant) submitted that PW1 (complainant) has\nproved his case beyond any reasonable doubts that the accused executed a\nExt P2 cheque and received 2 lakhs rupees in discharge of legally enforce-\nable debt. The accused also failed to rebut the presumption available under\nSection 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act as per law in favour of the com-\nplainant. So complainant is entitled to get adequate compensation including\nthe cheque amount and interest as prayed for the complaint.\n\n11. The defence counsel on the other hand refuted the contentions put forward by\n\n6\n\nthe counsel for the complainant and stated that merely putting a signature in\ncheque leaf is not a valid execution. This aspect was discussed in A Pathu\nand Others Vs. Khatheesa Umma reported in 1990(2) KLJ 115. The learned\ndefence counsel put a question for consideration is whether a cheque bears\nonly the admitted signature of the accused can be considered as execution of a\ncheque. To substantiate this contention the learned counsel for the accused\nplaced the decisions of Hon’ble High Court of Kerala Joseph Vs. Gladis\nSasi reported in 2010(3) KLT 379, Santhy C V. Mary Sherly and Another\nreported in 2011 (3) KHC 22, Purushothaman Nair V. Sreekantan Nair\nreported in 2013 (4) KLJ 256 and submitted that as per the decisions it is\nstated that admission of the person that he signed a blank cheque leaf does not\namount to the execution of the cheque.\n\n12. The learned defence counsel submitted that when the same question was came\nup for consideration in Ranganna V. Mohan (AIR 2010 SCC 1898) the\nHon’ble Supreme Court of India held that since the accused did admit that\nthe cheque was his, the statutory presumption comes in to play. The learned\ncounsel for the accused placed some other decisions of Hon’ble Supreme\nCourt of India and Hon’ble High Court of Kerala which are as follows: ANSS\nRajashekar Vs. Agustus Jeba Ananth (2019 (2) KHC 155), Shabeer M Vs.\nAnitha Bajee and Another (2022 (6) KHC 704),Ahammed P.K V. State of\nKerala (2024(3) KHC 176), Bharat Barrel and Drum Mfg Co. V. Amin\nChand Payerlal reported in 1999 KHC 467 and _ Basalingappa V.\nMudibasappa, (2019 (2) KHC 451). Based on the decisions the learned coun-\nsel for the accused argued that the PW1 (complainant) had failed to adduce\nevidence to prove his case.\n\n13. The learned defence counsel submitted that the PW1 (complainant) is\nunaware about the whereabouts of the accused. In the examination in chief of\nPW1 (complainant) stated that the accused approached PW1 for urgent\nfinancial assistance. But during the cross examination PW1 stated that she had\nlent money to the accused upon the request of her son. It is brought out from\n\n7\nthe evidence of PW1 that nobody is present in the house of the complainant at\nthe time of alleged transaction. So the consideration of Ext P2 cheque is not\nat all proved by other aspects. PW1 in her cross examination kept mum\nwhile asking questions relating to the date of transaction and issuance of the\nExt P2 cheque. The learned defence counsel pointed out some discrepancies\nin the testimony of complainant through his argument note.\n\n14.I have gone through those matters and considered those contentions put\nforward by the learned defence counsel in this case. Another defence is that\nPW1 deposed that during 2015 the accused might have resided either in\nThycaud or Vazhuthacaud. But the advocate notice was sent to the address in\nthe place of Thamalam and that too was not accepted by the accused. The\nlearned defence counsel submitted that throughout the evidence, and 313 of the\naccused, he had a consistent version that the accused was a producer of a\ntelevision serial Mughom and the Son of the complainant Harikumar was a\nexecutive producer. The son of the complainant was entrusted with the cheque\nleaf as a part of his work purpose and Ext P2 cheque was also in his custody\nalong with other cheque leafs. The complainant’s son demanded money from\nthe accused and accused failed to pay it. So DW2, the son of the complainant\nmisused Ext P2 cheque and filed this case through PW1. In order to prove it\nson of PW1 was examined as DW2. Non examination of DW2 by PW1 itself\nproves the falsity of the case set up by PW1. From the side of the accused the\nmanager of Bank of Baroda was examined as DW1 and Ext D1 and D2 were\nmarked. Ext D1 is the statement of the account and Ext D2 is the passbook.\nExt P2 cheque is bearing no. 000009. From Ext D1 and D2 documents, it can\nbe seen that except Ext P2 cheque all other cheque leafs were passed by the\nbank during 2013 and 2014. But the Ext P2 cheque is dated 01.02.2016. So\nthis discredit the version of PW1 that the cheque was issued in the year 2016\nby the accused to PW1 for a legally enforceable debt. In an ordinary course of\nthe transaction, it would happen by using cheque leafs continuously one by\none in a constitutive manner. So it cannot be presumed that the accused kept\n\n8\n\nExt P2 cheque in his custody after the issuance of the constitutive cheque leafs\nso as to give it to the PW1 for the discharge of legally enforceable debt in the\nyear 2016. It is true that the accused did not issue reply notice to Ext P4\nadvocate notice. In Rajmohan V. Chandrika Shaji reported in 2023 KHC\n253 is observed that failure to send a reply notice by itself cannot lead to the\nconclusion of the allegation of notice being accepted. In the facts and\ncircumstances of the case, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that\nwhether the complainant failed to establish the presumption of the existence\nthe legally enforceable debt and the same has been rebutted by the accused.\nHence the accused may be acquitted on the ground that the PW1(complainant)\nfailed to prove this case beyond reasonable doubt in support of the two cardinal\npresumptions against the accused w/s. 118 and 139 of the Negotiable\nInstruments Act.\n\n15. Ihave analysed the evidence of PW1, DW1 and DW2 and perused Ext P1 to\nP6, D1 and D2. The specific case of the accused is that he had never executed\nan Ext P2 cheque in favour of PW1 for any legally enforceable debt. The\naccused was a producer of a Television serial named Mughom and the son of\nPW1 who was examined as DW2 was the Executive producer of that\nTelevision serial. The accused entrusted some cheque leafs to DW2 for\nfacilitating production work of his serial. The complainant's son (DW2)\nmisused the cheque and demanded money. When the accused refused the\ndemand of DW2, DW2 misused the Ext P2 cheque and filed this complaint\nthrough PW1 who is the mother of DW2. It is brought out from the evidence\nof PW1 that PW1 was acquainted with the accused through DW2. PW1 was\nsubjected to lengthy cross examination by the defence counsel. During the\ncross examination PW1 stated that due to the immediate financial necessity,\nthe accused approached him and borrowed a sum of Rs. 2,00,000/- (Rupees\nTwo Lakhs only) and the said amount was given as per the direction of DW2.\n\n16. On analysing the evidence of PW1 it is true that she could not know much\nabout the accused and the accused was introduced to her by DW2. On\n\n9\nanalysing the evidence of DW2 it is seen that a specific question was asked by\nthe defence counsel as follows:- “lend  Mmildlac anglasslar\nHE PWYMG GHOEMATVo S] AEPWAMM MOUQKCGONIG] GIO NGaAla\nO2186) GH GRO AMIENS CGHISO|OIG nNOIR@OAHWA@A alo~Mao.”\nAnswer - “@2186 MoenIMDAs® Mra@IeE UleilerMyc emesis Manic\neel.” So from the evidence of DW2, it is clear that he completely denied the\nspecific defence put forward by the defence counsel. Even though PW1 was\nsubjected to lengthy cross examination there is some discrepancies with regard\nto the whereabouts of the accused but she had deposed in tune with the\ncomplaint that Ext P2 cheque was executed by the accused in her residence.\nDuring the cross examination, the defence counsel put a question with regard\nto the difference in handwriting and signature in Ext P2 cheque. But\nnothing was brought out from the cross examination of PW1 regarding this\naspect. In this aspect, [have referred the decision of the Hon'ble High Court\nof Kerala in Oriental Bank of Commerce V. Prabodh Kumar Tewari\nreported in 2022 (5) KHC 560 held that the fact the details in cheque by\nfilled up not by the drawer but by some other person could de in material.\nThe presumption which arises for the signing of cheque cannot be rebutted\nmerely by the report of a handwriting expert. Even if the details of the cheque\nhave not been filled up by the drawer but by another person this is not relevant\nto the defence whether the cheque was issued to the payment of debt. In\nKalamani Tex V. P. Balasubramanian reported in 2021 (5) SCC 281 is held\nthat a drawer who signs a cheque and hands it over to the payee is presumed\nto be liable unless the drawer adduces evidence to rebut the presumption that\nthe cheque has been issued towards the payment of a debt or discharge of a\nliability. So the contention put forward by the defence counsel on this point\nwould not sustain in this case. The second defence put forward by the defence\ncounsel is that even though the accused did not issue a reply notice in answer\nto the Ext P3 advocate notice is not fatal to the case of the defence in the light\n\n10\n\nof the decision of Rajmohan V. Chandrika Shaji reported in 2023 KHC 253.\nThe Hon'ble High Court of Kerala observed that failure to sent reply notice by\nitself cannot lead to a conclusion that the allegation in the notice is being\naccepted. I have gone through the decision of Hon'ble High Court of Kerala\nin para no. 6 it is observed that the failure on the part of the accused to sent a\nreply notice is not to be taken seriously in the circumstances of the case. No\ndoubt failure to sent reply notice cannot lead to a conclusion that the allegation\nin the notice being accepted. At the same time the Hon'ble High Court by\nreferring to the decision of Gopakumar P. Vs. B. Anilkumar reported in\n2011 (3) KHC 850 held that failure of the accused to explain the reason for\nnot sending the reply notice would weaken the defence case. Here in this\ncase, the defence has failed to explain the reason for not sending the reply\nnotice to the Ext P4 advocate notice. So the sole contention put forward by\ndefence counsel that non sending of reply notice would not weaken the\ndefence case in its entirety would not sustain in this case.\n\n17. The PW1 (complainant) denied to all the suggestive questions put forward\nby the defence counsel regarding the non execution of Ext P3 cheque by the\naccused. So the question to be considered is whether the accused discharged\nhis evidential burden to rebut the presumption of law available under\nSection 139 of the Negotiable Instrument Act. To answer this point, I have\ngone through the following decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court and\nobservation is made by the Hon'ble Apex Court. To answer this point I have\ngone through the decision of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Gimpex Private Ltd.\nV. Manoj Goel reported in (2022)11 SCC 705, the Hon'ble Apex Court has\nunpacked the ingredients forming the basis of the offence under Section 138\nof the Negotiable Instruments Act the following structure:-\n\n1. The drawing of a cheque by person on an account maintained by him\nwith the banker for payment of any amount of money to another person\nfrom that account.\n\n2. The cheque being drawn in discharge of whole or part of the debt or\n\n11\nother liability.\n\n3. Presentation of the cheque to the bank arranged to be paid from that\naccount.\n\n4, The return of the cheque by the drawee bank as unpaid either because\nthe amount of money standing to the credit of that account is insufficient\nto honour the cheque.\n\n5. Anotice by the payee making a demand for the payment of the amount\nto the drawer of the cheque within 30 days of the receipt of information\nfrom the bank in regard to the return of the cheque.\n\n6. The drawer of the cheque failed to make payment to the payee within 15\ndays of the receipt of the notice.\n\n7. These matters were summarized by the Hon’ble Apex Court in K.\nBhaskaran V. Sankaran Vaidyan Balan (1999) 7 SCC 510.\n\n18. The five acts as set out by the Hon’ble Apex Court in the above decisions are\ngenerally speaking matters of record and would be available in the form of\ndocumentary evidence as early as, at the stage of filing the complaint and\ninitiating prosecution. Apart from that it is also to be proved that the cheque\nwas issued in discharge of debt or liability as explained by the Hon'ble Apex\nCourt in the Gimpex case. So the burden of proving this fact could ordinarily\nfall upon the complainant. But under Section 139 requires the accused to prove\nthe non-existence of the presumed fact ie, that the cheque was not issued in\ndischarge of a debt or liability. The Negotiable Instruments Act provides for\ntwo presumptions Section 118 and 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.\nSection 118 of the Negotiable Instruments Act interalia directed that it shall be\npresumed until the contrary is proved, that every Negotiable Instruments was\nmade or drawn for consideration. On the other hand, Section 139 of the\nNegotiable Instruments Act stipulates that unless the contrary is proved it shall\nbe presumed that the holder of the cheque received the cheque, for the\ndischarge of, whole or part or any debt or liability. It seems that \"presumed\nfact\" directly relates to one of the crucial ingredients to sustain a conviction\n\n12\nunder Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Section 139 of the\nNegotiable Instruments Act requires that the court shall presume the fact stated\ntherein. So it is obligatory for the court to raise this presumption in every case\nwhere a factual basis for raising the presumption had been established.\n\n19. The court will necessarily presume that the cheque had been issued towards\nthe discharge of legally enforceable debt in two circumstances. Firstly, when\nthe drawer of the cheque admits the execution of the cheque and secondly, in\nthe event where the complainant proves that the cheque was executed in his\nfavour by the drawer. This matter was discussed by the Hon’ble Apex Court\nBharath Barrel V. Amin Chand (1999) 3 SCC 35. Recently, the Hon’ble\nApex Court in Bir Singh V. Mukesh Kumar 2019 (2) KLJ 205 has discussed\nabout a situation where the accused contends that a blank cheque leaf was\nvoluntarily signed and handed over by him to the complainant. The Hon’ble\nApex Court held that mere admission of the drawer’s signature without\nadmitting the execution of the entire contends in the cheque is now sufficient\nto trigger the presumption. At the same time in Basalingappa V.\nMudibasappa_ reported in AIR 2019 SCC 1983 and Kumar Exports V.\nSharma Carpets 2009 (2) SCC 513. It is held that in order to rebut the\npresumption and prove to the contrary, it is open to the accused to raise a\nprobable defence wherein the existence of a legally enforceable debt or\nliability can be contested. The word “ until the contrary” is proved occurring\nthe section 139 does not mean that accused must necessarily prove in all\naspects that the instrument is not issued in discharge of any debt or liability\nbut the accused has the option to bring circumstances of the case to act upon\nthe supposition that debt did not exist. On going through the decision of the\nHon’ble Apex Court it is seen that the accused is left with two options. The\nfirst option for proving that the debt does not exist is to lead defence evidence\nand conclusive establish with certainty that the cheque was not issued in\ndischarge of a debt. The second option is to prove the non-existence of debt\nby a preponderance of probabilities by referring to the particular circumstances\n\n13\nof the case. In Kumar Exports and Sharma Carpets case Supra the Hon’ble\nApex Court observed that the preponderance of probability in favour of the\naccused's is may be fifty-one to forty-nine arising out of the entire\ncircumstances of the case which includes the complainant's version in the orig-\ninal complaint, the case taken on the demand notice, complainant's case at the\ntrial, plea of the accused in the reply notice, his 313 statement and defence\ntaken at the trial as to the circumstances under which the cheque was disputed.\nThe accused can adduce direct evidence to prove that the instrument was not\nissued in discharge of a debt or liability and if he adduced acceptable\nevidence the burden again shifts to the complainant. Here in this case, the\naccused have not adduced sufficient evidence during the trial proceedings in\nthis case so as to rebut the presumption available under Section 139 of the\nNegotiable Instruments Act. In Bir Singh V. Mukesh Kumar reported in 2019\n(4) SCC 197 it is held that mere admission of drawers signature without\nadmitting the execution of the entire contents in the cheque is now sufficient\nto trigger the presumption. Here in this case, the accused has only raised a\nsuggestive question during the cross-examination denying the execution of the\ncheque without any proof to raise a probable defence to conclusively establish\nwith certainty that the cheque was not issued in discharge of debt by\npreponderance of probabilities referring to the particular circumstances of the\ncase as discussed by Hon’ble Apex Court in Basalingappa  V.\nMudibasappa_ reported in AIR 2019 SCC 1983 and Kumar Exports V.\nSharma Carpets discussed in (2009) 2 SCC 513. So based on the above\ndiscussion in the light of the decision of the Hon’ble Apex Court it can be seen\nthat accused did not adduce any direct evidence to prove that the Ext P2\ncheque was not issued to PW1 (complainant) in the discharge of a legally\nenforceable debt. Except the argument of the defence counsel that the Ext\nP2 cheque was not executed for an amount of Rs. 2,00,000/- (Rupees Two\nLakhs Only) as a security for the legally enforceable debt as contended by the\nPW1 (complainant), no single piece of evidence was adduced from the side of\n\n14\ndefence to substantiate his contention even by a preponderance of probabilities\nby referring to the particular circumstances of the case as discussed above.\n\n20. In this case even though PW1 subjected to lengthy cross examination nothing\nmore has been brought out in this case to rebut the presumption available under\nSection 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Even though defence counsel\nput forward a strong defence that the Ext P2 cheque in question was not\nhanded over to PW1 and there is no transaction as alleged by PW1, it was not\nproved through cogent evidence to show that the Ext P2 cheque was not issued\nin discharge of the debt as stated in the complaint. The accused has failed to\npoint out inconsistencies in the evidence of PW1 and also to set forth\npreponderance of probabilities through his defence case. So as to rebut the\npresumption available under Section 139 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.\n\n21. Based on the analysis of evidence in this case this court finds that the PW1\n(complainant) has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused borrowed\nan amount of Rs. 2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lakhs Only) from the PW1\n(complainant) and issued Ext P2 cheque for the legally enforceable debt.\nHence this court finds that the accused committed the offence under Section\n138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Hence, these points are found in\nfavour of the complainant.\n\n22. Point No. 4:- In the result, the accused is found guilty of offence punishable\nunder Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and is convicted\nthereunder. Considering the circumstances of the case that it comes under the\ncategory of Negotiable Instruments Act and is punishable under Section 138 of\nthe Negotiable Instruments Act, I am not inclined to invoke the provisions of\nthe Probation of Offenders Act in favour of the accused. The accused has to\nbe given adequate punishment for the offence committed by him. At the same\ntime, PW1 (complainant) has to be compensated for the loss on account of the\ndishonour of the Ext P2 cheque. It can be made by the payment of cheque\namount with interest at a reasonable rate. The case in hand is seen filed in the\nyear 2016. 9 years have elapsed since then. Hence I find it reasonable to\n\n15\n\nimpose 6 % interest for 9 years over the principal amount to be paid to the\ncomplainant covered under Ext P2 cheque. The interest at the rate of 6 % for\nthe cheque amount of Rs. 2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lakhs Only) for a period of\n9 years will be Rs.1,08,000/- (Rupees One Lakh Eight Thousand Only). Then\nthe total amount would be Rs.3,08,000/- (Rupees Three Lakhs Eight Thousand\nOnly).
