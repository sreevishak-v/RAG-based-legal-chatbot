The petitioners\nnow seek orders quashing the prosecution, on the ground that\nthey and the injured persons including the first informant have\ncome to terms amicably out of court. The first informant, Junaise\nis the 2\" respondent herein, and the other persons who\nsustained injuries are the respondent Nos. 3 to 6.

No. 91/2015 2\n\nno grievance or complaint. I am well satisfied that there is a real\nand genuine settlement between the parties, and I also find that\nSection 308 IPC was in fact incorporated by the police on the\nbasis of a purely hypothetical statement. This is a simple case of\nassault in which the respondents sustained some simple injuries.\nAny way, the dispute now stands settled. It is definite that\ncontinuance of prosecution will not serve any purpose in the\nabove circumstances, because nobody will support the\nprosecution, if the case goes to trial.\n\nIn the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed. The prosecution in\nS.C.No.131/2013 of the Court of Session, Kalpetta as against the\npetitioners 2 to 8, and in C.P.No.3/2013 of the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate Court, Mananthavady as against the first petitioner\nherein, will stand quashed",
