SREEJA V. (PP)\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n23.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nBiel\n2024/KER/5266\nCRL.MC 720/2024\n2\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J\neen\nORDER\n\nPetitioner is the first accused in S.C.No.1205/2020 on the\nfiles of the Additional Sessions Court (Adhoc)-II, Kollam; for\nthe offences punishable under Sections 120(b), 143, 144, 148,\n449, 294(b), 506(ii), 341, 323, 324 & 302 r/w Section 149 of\nthe Indian Penal Code, 1860. Subsequently, petitioner was\nimplicated as an accused in Crime No. 1712/2023 of Kollam\nEast Police Station. On 19.01.2024, petitioner has been\ngranted interim bail for the subsequent crime.\n\n2. While the proceedings in S.C.No.1205/2020 were going on\nbefore the Sessions Court, and due to the registration of the\nsecond crime, petitioner failed to appear before the trial\ncourt, apprehending his arrest. Due to his failure to appear\nbefore the Sessions Court, a non bailable warrant has been\nissued against him. Though petitioner was represented\n\nBiel\n2024/KER/5266\nCRL.MC 720/2024\n3\nthrough his Counsel, who had even sought for condonation\nof his absence, the learned Sessions Judge issued a non\nbailable warrant against the petitioner, which is challenged in\nthis petition under Section 482 of Cr.P.C.\n\n3. Sri.M.Rajesh, the learned counsel for the petitioner, submitted\nthat petitioner has been granted interim bail on 19.01.2024 in\nB.A.No.10827/2023; and therefore the apprehension of arrest\nin the subsequent crime does not subsist. However, since a\nnon bailable warrant has been issued against him, petitioner\napprehends that he may be remanded to custody on his\nappearance before the Sessions Court. It is further submitted\nthat petitioner is willing to cooperate with the trial without\nfail.\n\n4. Smt.Sreeja V., the learned Public Prosecutor, opposed the\napplication and submitted that petitioner is involved in a\nserious crime and that he has involved himself in a\nsubsequent crime as well as, and therefore, this Court ought\nnot to issue any direction to consider the bail application in\na time bound manner.\n\nBier\n2024/KER/5266\nCRL.MC_720/2024\n4\n\n5. I have considered the rival contentions.\n\n6. It was evident from Annexure-3 that, though the petitioner\nwas directed to appear before the Court on 12.12.2023 and\nhe had appeared through counsel, the Sessions Court had\nrejected the application for condonation of his absence and\nissued a non bailable warrant after cancellation of the bail\nbond. True that petitioner apprehended arrest in the second\ncrime. However, that is not a reason to avoid appearing in\ncourt when there was a direction to appear. Considering the\ncircumstances of the case, the omission to appear on the\nposting date despite a direction by the said Court is a\nserious omission. However, since petitioner has now offered\nto appear before the court and participate in the proceedings\nwithout fail, I am of the view that circumstances warrant the\nissuance of a direction to the learned Sessions Judge to\nconsider the application for recall of warrant and for bail, if\nany, filed by the petitioner, on the same day itself.\n\n7. Accordingly, if the petitioner prefers any application for\nrecall of warrant and for grant of bail on or before\n\nBiel\nbie) pice)\nSaat\n2024/KER/5266\nCRL.MC_720/2024\n5\n02.02.2024, the learned Sessions Judge shall consider the\nsame on the same day itself and pass appropriate orders.\nThe Crl.M.C.is disposed of.\nsd/-\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\nAMV/23/01/2024\n\nBeas\na; eee\nbie} peta\nBats\n2024/KER/5266\nCRL.MC 720/2024\n6\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 720/2024\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES\nANNEXURE1 THE TRUE COPY OF THE ORDERS OF THIS\nHON'BLE COURT IN BA NO. 1237/2023\nDATED 30.09.2023\nANNEXURE2 THE TRUE COPY OF THE NOTARIZED\nAFFIDAVIT DATED 02.12.2023 SUBMITTED\nBY THE DEFACTO COMPLAINANT WHICH WAS\nMARKED AS ANNEXURE-3 IN BAIL\nAPPLICATION NO. 10827/2023\nANNEXURES .
