On the side of prosecution, PW1 was examined and Exhibit P1 was marked. As\nthe material witnesses failed to support the prosecution case, the learned\nAssistant Public Prosecutor gave up the CW2 to CW10.. In the absence of any\nincriminating circumstances against the accused Nos.1 to 3 , questioning of the\naccused Nos. 1 to 3, under section 313(1)(b) of Cr.P.C. was dispensed with.\nAccused Nos. 1 to 3 were called upon to adduce evidence but no defence\nevidence was adduced from the side of the accused Nos 1 to 3.\n\n5. Heard both sides and perused records.\n\n6. The following points have arisen for determination:\n\n1.

If the accused Nos. 1 to 3 are found guilty? What is the order as to\nsentence?\n\n7. Point Nos.. 1 to 6:-To avoid repetition and for brevity, point nos. 1 to 6 are\nconsidered together.
