M.C. ASHI (PP)\nSRI. VIPIN T. JOSE (FOR RESPONDENT)\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n22.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nBTR aR\n2024/KER/5270\nCRL.MC 103/2024\n3\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J\neee i ee\nORDER\nPetitioners have invoked the jurisdiction under Section 482\nCr.P.C to quash all proceedings against them.\n\n2. Petitioners are accused Nos. 1 to 9 in C.C.No.317/2020 on the\nfiles of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Kasaragod,\narising out of Crime No.438/2019 of Badiadkka Police Station\nregistered for the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147,\n148, and 427 r/w Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.\nThe 24 respondent is the defacto complainant.\n\n3. According to the prosecution, accused formed themselves into\nan unlawful assembly, protested against the Citizenship\nAmendment Act, and pelted stones on the car of the de facto\ncomplainant, causing damage to it, and thereby committed the\noffences alleged.\n\n4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned\n\nBTR aR\n2024/KER/5270\nCRL.MC_103/2024\n4\ncounsel for the respondent, apart from the learned Public\nProsecutor.\n\n5. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the\nmatter has been settled and hence the proceedings against the\npetitioners ought to be quashed. It was also submitted that,\nconsidering the nature of offences alleged, no purpose would be\nserved by continuing the proceedings.\n\n6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and Another |(2012) 10 SCC\n303], the Apex Court has held that in appropriate cases, the\nHigh Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes\nbetween the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the\ncriminal proceedings. This view was reiterated in Narinder\nSingh and Others vy. State of Punjab and Another [(2014) 6 SCC\n466] and Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State of Jharkhand\nand Another [(2014) 9 SCC 653].\n\n7. 1 have perused Annexure-AlIl affidavit filed by the 27\nrespondent. The learned Public Prosecutor has submitted that\nupon verification, it is understood that the affidavit is genuine,\nand the de facto complainant stands by the contents thereof. I\n\nDP. ee 4\n2024/KER/5270\nCRL.MC 103/2024\n5\nam satisfied that the matter has been settled and no public\ninterest is involved in this case. There is no impediment for\ngranting the prayer for quashing. The continuance of the\nproceedings will only be an exercise in futility.\n\n8. Though the learned Public Prosecutor pointed out that accused\n3 to 6, 8 and 10 have criminal antecedents against them, I am\nof the view that considering the nature of the settlement\narrived at between the parties, no purpose would be achieved\nin continuing the prosecution.\n\n9. Accordingly, all proceedings against the petitioners in\nC.C.No.317/2020 on the files of Judicial First Class Magistrate\nCourt-II, Kasaragod, are quashed.\n\nThis Crl.M.C is allowed as above.\nsd/-\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\nAMV/22/01/2024\n\nBiel\noe. she\n2024/KER/S270\nCRL.MC_103/2024\n6\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 103/2024\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES\nANNEXURE AI A TRUE COPY OF THE F.I.R IN CRIME NO.\n438 OF 2019 OF BADIADKA POLICE STATION,\nKASARAGOD\nANNEXURE AII CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT IN\nCRIME NO. 438 OF 2019 OF BADIADKA\nPOLICE STATION, KASARAGOD\nANNEXURE AIITI THE AFFIDAVIT SWORN TO BY THE\nRESPONDENT\nTRUE COPY\n\n"
