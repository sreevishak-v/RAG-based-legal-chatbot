EN\n CrI.M.C.No.7515 of 2016\nDated this the 6” day of January, 2017\nORDER\n\nThe petitioners herein are the accused Nos. 1 and 2\nin CC.3643/2015 of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,\nTripunithura for offences under Sections 420, 120b of\nthe Indian Penal Code along with Section 34 of the Indian\nPenal Code.\n\n2. The crux of the allegation raised by the defacto\ncomplaint who is the first respondent is that, the\npetitioners herein had entered into an agreement for sale\nto assign their property for a total consideration of\nRs.10,00,000/- (Rupees ten lakhs' only) received\nRs.5,00,000/- (Rupees five lakhs only). In spite of receipt\nof the entire consideration, without assigning the property\nto the defacto complainant assigned the property to third\nparty.\n\n3. The crux of the contention of the learned\ncounsel for the petitioners is that, they have not entered\ninto an agreement for sale and certain blank documents\n\nCrl.M.C.No.7515 of 2016 2\nobtained by the first respondent in another transaction\nwas misused by forging her signature. To buttress that\nargument, the learned counsel has relied on Annexure-\nA3, which is claimed to be a blank signed stamp paper\nentrusted with the accused. It was further contended that\nthe case has got essentially the nature of a civil dispute\nand no criminal intention can be attributed to the parties.\n4. Essentially the question whether the petitioners\nherein had entered into an agreement for sale, even if\nsuch an agreement was entered into whether the accused\nhad an intention from the beginning not to assign the\nproperty and to cheat them, are all matters of evidence.\nThough the learned counsel for the petitioners relied on\nunreported decisions of this court in Crl.M.C.No.869/2015\nwhich is also broadly based on the similar facts, I am not\ninclined to agree with the contentions of the petitioners.\nThe above decisions refers to the case wherein due to\nreasons beyond the control of the owner of the property,\nit could not be assigned. These are all facts to be decided\nby the trial court itself. Considering these facts, I am not\n\nal\naa\nBia\n2017/KER/710\nCrl.M.C.No.7515 of 2016 3\ninclined to quash the proceedings at this stage. Crl.M.C\nfails and is dismissed, reserving the right of the\npetitioners herein to advance all their arguments before\nthe court below. In the event of the petitioners herein\nfiling an application for permanent exemption and for\npermission to appear before the court below through\ncounsel, that can be considered by the court below,\nhaving regard to the fact that the petitioners are women\nand also mother and daughter.\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE\nR.AV\n//True Copy//\nPA to Judge\n\n"
