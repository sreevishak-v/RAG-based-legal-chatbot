According to the prosecution, the\nsecond accused could not be apprehended in the course\nof investigation and his identity could not be confirmed\nthrough the defacto complainant. On the other hand, the\ncontention of the learned counsel for the petitioners is\nthat he has been wrongly implicated on the basis of\nmistaken identity and that he has never absconded. The\nlearned counsel relied on an affidavit filed by the defacto\ncomplainant stating that the present petitioners is not the\nperson about whom he has raised the allegations. Since\nit largely depends on the question of identification of a\nperson, I am not inclined to consider that in the Crl.M.C.\nThe petitioners may seek their relief before the trial\ncourt. Reserving that right, the Crl.M.C is closed.\n\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE\nRAV ITRUE COPY/\nPATO JUDGE\n\n"
