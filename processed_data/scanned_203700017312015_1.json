HARILAL, J.\nCriLM.C. No. 1731. of 2015\nDated this the 21* day of April, 2015.\nORDER\nPetitioners are the accused Nos. 1 to 4 in Crime No.288\nof 2014 registered for the offences punishable under Sections\n323, 294(b), 498 (A) r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal code.\nIn this petition, it is stated that during the pendency of the\nprosecution against the petitioners for the said offences, the\ndisputes between the petitioners and the second respondent\nhas been settled amicably and the second respondent is no\nmore interested to proceed the case further. At present, the\nfirst petitioner and the second respondent are living separately\nand they do not want to live together. In view of the fact that\nthey have settled the entire disputes, both parties urged for\nquashing the criminal prosecution against the petitioners\ninvoking the inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure. The second respondent has filed\nAnnexure A4 affidavit and A3 joint statement stating that she\n\nAn\n% Santee\nBae\n2015/KER/17250\nCri.M.C. No. 1731 of 2015\n-~2-\nwants to put end to the criminal prosecution against the\npetitioners.\n\n2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the\nlearned counsel for the second respondent.\n\n3. Both the counsel appeared for the respective parties\nurged for quashing the criminal prosecution against the\npetitioners under Annexure A2 final report. In support of the\nabove arguments, both the counsel cited the decision in Gian\nSingh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)].\n\nI have meticulously considered the decision laid down in\nGian Singh's case. In the above case, three Judge Bench of\nthe Apex Court, on a reference, considered the question\nwhether the High Court has power to quash _ criminal\nproceedings involving non-compoundable offences on the basis\nof the compromise reached between the offender and the\nvictim and answered as given below:\n\n\"57. The position that emerges from the above\ndiscussion can be summarised thus: the power of the\nHigh Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or F.I.R. or\ncomplaint in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is\n\nElie\nBlea\n2015/KER/17250\nCril.M.C. No. 1731 of 2015\n-3-\ndistinct and different from the power given to a criminal\ncourt for compounding the offences under S.320 of the\nCode. Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no\nstatutory limitation but it has to be exercised in accord\nwith the guideline engrafted in such power viz;(i) to\nsecure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the\nprocess of any Court. In what cases power to quash the\ncriminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be\nexercised where the offender and victim have settled\ntheir dispute would depend on the facts and\ncircumstances of each case and no category can be\nprescribed. However, before exercise of such power,\nthe High Court must have due regard to the nature and\ngravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of\nmental depravity or offences like murder, rape, dacoity,\netc., cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim\nor victim's family and the offender have settled the\ndispute. Such offences are not private in nature and\nhave serious impact on_ society. Similarly, any\ncompromise between the victim and offender in relation\nto the offences under special statutes like Prevention of\nCorruption Act or the offences committed by public\nservants while working in that capacity etc; cannot\nprovide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedings\ninvolving such offences. But the criminal cases having\noverwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil flavour stand\non different footing for the purposes of quashing,\nparticularly the offences arising from commercial,\nfinancial, mercantile, civil, partnership or such like\n\nBei anal\nBlea\n2015/KER/17250\nCril.M.C. No. 1731 of 2015\n-4-\ntransactions or the offences arising out of matrimony\nrelating to dowry, etc., or the family disputes where the\nwrong is basically private or personal in nature and the\nparties have resolved their entire dispute. In this\ncategory of cases, High Court may quash criminal\nproceedings if in its view, because of the compromise\nbetween the offender and victim, the possibility of\nconviction is remote, bleak and continuation of criminal\ncase would put accused to great oppression and\nprejudice and extreme injustice would be caused to him\nby not quashing the criminal case despite full and\ncomplete settlement and compromise with the victim. In\nother words, the High Court must consider whether it\nwould be unfair or contrary to the interest of justice to\ncontinue with the criminal proceeding or continuation of\nthe criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of\nprocess of law despite settlement and compromise\nbetween the victim and wrongdoer and whether to\nsecure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal\ncase is put to an end and if the answer to the above\nquestion(s) is in affirmative, the High Court shall be well\nwithin its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding.”\n\n2. In view of the proposition laid down above, the\nquestion to be considered, in the instant case, is, whether the\nnon-compoundable offence involved in this case can be\ncompounded, in the exercise of the inherent power under\n\n2015/KER/17250\nCri.M.C. No. 1731 of 2015\n-5-\n\nSection 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Prima facie, I\nfind that the offences alleged against the petitioners will not\ncome under the category of non-compoundable offences, which\nare specifically excluded from composition, in the exercise of\ninherent power under Sec.482 of the Cr.P.C. Going by the\naffidavit filed by the de facto complainant, it is seen that the\ndispute between the accused and the victim had been amicably\nsettled and at present the de facto complainant has no\nsubsisting grievance at all. The de facto complainant does not\nwant to proceed with prosecution against the accused. — Full\nand final settkement and compromise with the victim are\nevidenced by Annexure A4 affidavit and A3 joint statement.\nIn view of the compromise between the petitioners and the\nvictim, I find that the possibility of conviction is remote and\nbleak, and continuation of the criminal case would put the\nparties to great oppression, prejudice and also tantamount to\nabuse of the process of the court. The present criminal\nprosecution against the accused must be put to an end to\n\nmabe\npee mates\na\n2015/KER/17250\nCri.M.C. No. 1731 of 2015\n-6-\nsecure the interest of justice.\n3. In this analysis, the prosecution proceedings against\nthe petitioners under Annexure-A2 final report will stand\nquashed, in the exercise of jurisdiction and power under\nSection 482 of the Cr.P.C.\nThis petition is allowed.\nSd/-\nK. HARILAL\nJUDGE\nScl.\n\n"
