Annexure E affidavit has been filed by the 2™ respondent,\nand Annexure F by the 3% respondent stating that the dispute\nhas been settled and that they have no subsisting grievance\nagainst the petitioner.\n\n2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also, who, on\ninstructions, submits that the petitioner has no_ criminal\nantecedents.\n\n3. Having considered the gravity of the offences alleged,\nnature of the injury caused and having perused the affidavit filed\nby the respondents 2 and 3, the contents of which are submitted\nto be true and voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is\nsettled and that no public interest is involved in this matter.\n\nCrme 5487/2020 3 2021/KER/1701\nUnder normal circumstances, piece-meal quashing of\nproceedings is not entertained by this court. As far as the\ninstant case is concerned, learned counsel appearing for the\npetitioner submits that petitioner's employment is at stake,\nunless and until the proceedings are quashed and certificate to\nthat effect produced before the authorities. Taking the special\ncircumstances and the fact that the allegation is only of an\noffence under Section 324 IPC, having been committed by the\npetitioner along with others, the prayer for quashing the\nproceedings is being entertained. Moreover, in view of the\nsettlement, possibility of the criminal proceedings ending in\nconviction is remote. As such, continuance of the proceedings\nwill amount to an abuse of process of court and hence, in view\nof the legal position set out by the Honourable Supreme Court in\nMadan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC 582]\nand Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another [(2012) 10\nSCC 303], there is no impediment in granting the relief sought.\n\n4. In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. The proceedings in\nC.C.No.1474 of 2018 of Judicial First Class Magistrate-III,\nAttingal is quashed.
