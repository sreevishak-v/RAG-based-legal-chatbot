In the said\ncase, they stand indicted for offences punishable under\nSections 341, 323, 294(b), 506(2), 308, 427 read with\nSection 34 of the IPC.\n\n2.The prosecution allegation is that on 23.8.2015 at 8 a.m.,\nwhile the de facto complainant was returning back in a\nbike, the petitioners herein are alleged to have wrongfully\nrestrained him and after abusing him assaulted him with\ntheir hands. It is further alleged that the 3 accused in\nthe aforesaid case had attempted to hit the de facto\ncomplainant with an iron rod on his head and if he had not\nevaded the blow, the accused would have been guilty of\n\nap\n2016/KER/42227\n\nCrl.M.C.6232/2016 2\nculpable homicide not amounting to murder.\n\n3.Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners,\nthe 3™ respondent as well as the learned Public\nProsecutor.\n\n4.It is submitted by the learned counsel appearing for the\n3 respondent that the disputes have been amicably\nresolved. Reference is also made to Annexure-A3 affidavit\nsworn to by him wherein it is asserted that the dispute\ndoes not subsist any more.\n\n5.The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submits\nthat in view of the settlement arrived at between the\nparties, this Court will be justified in quashing the\nproceedings. According to the learned counsel, the only\nallegation is that the 3% accused made an attempt to\nstrike the 3% respondent and the prosecution has no case\nthat any injury was sustained.\n\n6.The learned Public Prosecutor on instructions submits that\nthe 4 accused is involved in another case. However,\ninsofar as the other accused are concerned, no previous\n\nap\n2016/KER/42227\n\nCrl.M.C.6232/2016 3\nantecedents are reported.\n\n7.In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and Another [2012\n(10)SCC 303], the Apex Court has crystalised the position\nin respect of the powers vested in the High Court under\nS.482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, to quash criminal\nproceedings. It was held that the power vested in the\nHigh Court under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure\nCode, is not limited to quashing proceedings within the\nambit and scope of Section 320 of the Criminal Procedure\nCode. The three - Judge Bench in the above case,\nclearly expounded, that quashing of criminal proceedings\nunder S.482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, could also be\nbased on settlements between private parties, and could\nalso on a compromise between the offender and the\nvictim. Only that, the above power did not extend to\ncrimes against the society. It is also relevant to mention,\nthat the jurisdiction vested in the High Court under\nSection 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, for quashing\ncriminal proceedings, was held to be exercisable in\n\nsoramenran7\n\nCrl.M.C.6232/2016 4\ncriminal cases having an overwhelming and\npredominatingly civil flavour, particularly offences arising\nfrom commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership,\nor such like transactions. Or even offences arising out of\nmatrimony relating to dowry etc. or family disputes where\nthe wrong is basically private or personal. In all such\ncases, the parties should have resolved their entire\ndispute by themselves, mutually. Further, guidelines were\nissued by the Apex Court in Narinder Singh v. State of\nPunjab [2014 (6) SCC 466] and recently in Rajesh\nKamath J. and Others v. Mohana Kurup and Others\n[AIR 2016 SC 2452].\n\n8.I have considered the rival submissions and I have gone\nthrough the materials on record. The offence committed\nby the petitioners cannot be said to be grave and serious\nhaving ingredients of extreme mental depravity. It also\ndoes not appear that the offence in this case will have a\nserious impact on the society. More over, when the party\nrespondents have settled the matter, the possibility of\n\nLER]\n2016/KER/42227\n\nCrl.M.C.6232/2016 5\nconviction is remote and bleak and the continuation of the\ncriminal case against the petitioners would be a futile\nexercise. It would also put the petitioners and the party\nrespondents to great oppression and prejudice. Though\nthe 4\" accused is said to be involved in another case as\nwell, taking note of the allegations in the instant case, I\nam of the view that there is no reason to deny the prayer\nsought for.\n\n9.Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I am of\nthe considered view that this Court will be well justified in\ninvoking its extra ordinary powers under Section 482 of\nthe Code to quash the proceedings.\nIn the result, this petition will stand allowed.
