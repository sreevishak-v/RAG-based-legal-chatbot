CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n19.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nBasha]\nBae\nCRL.MC NO. 575 OF 2024 PEE\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.\n~ Cri.M.C. No.575 of 2024\nDated this the 19\" day of January, 2024\nORDER\n\nPetitioner challenges Annexure-B FIR in Crime No.4 of\n2024 of Kongad Police Station. The offence alleged against the\npetitioner is under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.\n\n2. | According to the FIR, the petitioner had collected an\namount of Rs.11 lakhs from the complainant by offering to\narrange a visa for his brother for Dubai and thereafter, failed to\narrange the visa or return the amount and thereby, committed\nthe offence alleged.\n\n3. Sri. Mansoor B.H., the learned counsel for the\npetitioner contended that, the entire allegations raised by the\ndefacto complainant are false and that, he had even\nsuppressed material facts as well. It was pointed out that,\nAnnexure-D is an enquiry report submitted on the very same\nset off facts, wherein the Inspector of Kongad Police Station\nconducted an enquiry and concluded that, there were doubts\nregarding the veracity of the complaint. According to the\n\n2024/KER/4266\nCRL.MC NO. 575 OF 2024\nlearned counsel, the said enquiry report is sufficient to\ndisprove the allegations in the FIR.\n\n4. Sri. Noushad K.A., learned Public Prosecutor\nopposed the contentions and submitted that, the investigation\nis only at the initial stages and it is too premature to interfere,\nunder Section 482 of Cr.P.C.\n\n5. | have considered the contentions advanced by the\npetitioner. The allegations in the FIR relates to an alleged\ncheating, committed by the petitioner for failure to arrange a\nvisa after collecting Rs.11 lakhs. On a perusal of Annexure-D, it\nis noticed that, an enquiry was conducted on the very same set\noff allegations by the Inspector of Kongad Police Station and\nconcluded that, there were doubts regarding the veracity of the\ncomplaint. However, merely because, such an enquiry was\nconducted on the very same set off allegations raised by the\ncomplainant, the same cannot be a reason to interfere with\nthe investigation now conducted. The said enquiry report can\nof course be taken into reckoning by the Investigating Officer\nduring the investigation based on the present FIR. Every FIR\nregistered must culminate in a final report, after due\ninvestigation. Therefore, the said natural process. of\n\nBrel\npene\n2024/KER/4266\nCRL.MC NO. 575 OF 2024\n4.\ninvestigation cannot be scuttled by invoking the jurisdiction\nunder Section 482 of Cr.P.C. unless there are exceptional\ncircumstances. It is for the Investigating Officer to arrive at a\nconclusion by considering the entire circumstances arising in\nthe instant case including Annexure-D. Therefore, Section 482\nof Cr.P.C cannot be invoked at this stage of the investigation.\nWith the above observations this Criminal M.C. is\ndismissed.\nSd/-\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\nLU\n\nBisel\n2024/KER/4266\nCRL.MC NO. 575 OF 2024\n_.5..\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 575/2024\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES :\nAnnexure A TRUE COPY OF THE PRIVATE COMPLAINT IN\nCMP NO:9838/2023 OF JUDICIAL FIRST\nCLASS MAGISTRATE COURT-2 PALAKKAD FILED\nBY THE 3RD RESPONDENT\nAnnexure B TRUE COPY OF THE F.I.R IN CRIME\nNO:4/2024 OF KONGAD POLICE STATION\nDATED 1/1/2024\nAnnexure C TRUE COPY OF THE COMPLAINT\nDATED31/10/2023 SUBMITTED BY THE THIRD\nRESPONDENT BEFORE THE 2ND RESPONDENT\nAnnexure D TRUE COPY OF THE REPORT SUBMITTED BY\nTHE SECOND RESPONDENT TO THE DISTRICT\nPOLICE CHIEF PALAKKAD DATED NIL\nAnnexure E TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER DATED 25/3/3023\nIN I.A NO:28/2021 IN COMMERCIAL SUIT\nNO:8/2021 OF PRINCIPAL SUB COURT,\nPALAKKAD\n// True Copy // PA To Judge\n\n"
