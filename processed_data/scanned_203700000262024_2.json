Petitioners are accused Nos. 1 to 3 in C.C. No.234\nof 2020 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate’s\nCourt, Payyannur arising out of Crime No.456 of 2019 of\nPariyaram Police Station, Kannur, registered for the\noffences under Sections 341, 323, 324 and 294(b) of the\nIndian Penal Code, 1860. 2°* respondent is the defacto\ncomplainant.\n\n3.

Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and\nthe learned counsel for the respondents, apart from the\n\n2024/KER/6397\nCRL.MC NO. 26 OF 2024\n3\nlearned Public Prosecutor.\n\n5. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted\nthat the matter has been settled and hence the\nproceedings against the petitioners ought to be quashed.\nIt was also submitted that, considering the nature of\noffences alleged, no purpose would be served by continuing\nthe proceedings.\n\n6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and Another\n[((2012) 10 SCC 303], the Apex Court has held that in\nappropriate cases, the High Court can take note of the\namicable resolution of disputes between the victim and the\nwrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. This\nview was reiterated in Narinder Singh and Others v.\nState of Punjab and Another [(2014) 6 SCC 466] and\nYogendra Yadav and Others v. State of Jharkhand and\nAnother [(2014) 9 SCC 653].\n\n7. Ihave perused Annexure-A-2 affidavit filed by the\n2™4 respondent. The learned Public Prosecutor has\nsubmitted that upon verification, it is understood that the\naffidavit is genuine, and the defacto complainant stands by\nthe contents thereof. I am satisfied that the matter has\nbeen settled and no public interest is involved in this case.\n\nBell\nSpe eke\nBIS aao\n2024/KER/6397\nCRL.MC NO. 26 OF 2024\n4\nThere is no impediment for granting the prayer for\nquashing. The continuance of the proceedings will only be\nan exercise in futility.\n\n8. Accordingly, all proceedings against the\npetitioners in C.C. No.234 of 2020 on the files of the\nJudicial First Class Magistrate’s Court, Payyannur arising\nout of Crime No.456 of 2019 of Pariyaram Police Station,\nKannur are quashed.\n\nThis Crl.M.C is allowed as above.\n\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\nAJM\n\nBES Sal\nip: ct eH\nric pusces\n2024/KER/6397\nCRL.MC NO. 26 OF 2024\n5\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 26/2024\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES\nAnnexure-A- 1 THE ORIGINAL COPY OF THE FINAL\nREPORT IN CRIME NUMBER 456/2019 OF\nPARIYARAM POLICE STATION SERVED TO\nTHE ACCUSED\nAnnexure -A-2 COPY OF THE AFFIDAVIT DATED\n28.12.2023 SIGNED BY 2ND RESPONDENT\nTRUE COPY\n\n"
