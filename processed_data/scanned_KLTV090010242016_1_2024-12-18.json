This is a case instituted upon the Final report filed by Sub Inspector of\nPolice, City Traffic Police Station in Crime No. 431 of 2009 for the offences\npunishable under Sections 279, 337 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 hereinafter\nreferred to as ‘the IPC’) r/w Section 134(b) of Motor Vehicles Act.\n2. The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: : Accused, the driver of the\ncar bearing registration No. KL-01-AL-6563 drove the same at about 9.00 am pm\non 14.11.2008 through Kesavadasapuram -Ulloor road rashly, negligently and in a\nmanner as to endanger human life and hit the Informant while she was walking\nthrough the road at the same direction. Due to its impact, the Informant fell on\nthe road and sustained serious injury on his head, right hand and contusion in the\nright knee. The Accused did not inform the same to the. Thus the Accused is\nalleged to have committed the abovesaid offences.\n3. This Court took cognizance in respect of offences under Sections 279, 337 of\nthe IPC r/w 134(b) of Motor Vehicle Act and took the case on file. On issuance of\nprocess, the Accused entered appearance. He was enlarged on bail. He was\nrepresented by a Counsel of his own choice. Copies of all relevant prosecution\nrecords were furnished to him. The particulars of offence under Sections 279, 337\nIPC r/w 134(b) of Motor Vehicles Act were read over and explained to him, to\nwhich he pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.\n\n3\n\n4. From the side of Prosecution, CW1 alone was examined as PW 1 and Exhibit\nPi marked. The presence of CW2 and 3 could not be procured by the Prosecution\nand Section 82 steps also effected against them. The remaining witnesses were\ngiven up by the Learned APP as the material witness turned hostile to the case of\nProsecution. Since no incriminating circumstances arose from the depositions of\nthe witnesses, the examination of the Accused under Section 313(1)(b) of the CrPC\nwas dispensed with. No Defence evidence was adduced.\n\n5. Heard both sides and perused relevant documents. The following points\narise for consideration.\n\na. Has the Accused driven the aforesaid vehicle rashly, negligently in a\n\nmanner endangering the life of PW1, causing injury to him and thereby\n\ncommitted the offence punishable under Section 279 of the IPC as alleged?\n\nb. Has the Accused driven the aforesaid vehicle and rashly, negligently\n\nin a manner endangering the life and personal safety to PW1, causing him\n\nhurt and thereby committed the offence punishable under Section 337 IPC\nas alleged?\n\nCc. Has the accused failed to inform the police, violating the mandate\n\nunder section 134(b) of MV Act and thereby commit the offence punishable\n\n134 (b) of Motor Vehicles Act?\n\nd. If so, the proper sentence to be awarded?\n\n6. Points (a) to (c): These points are considered together for the sake of\nbrevity and to avoid repetition.\n\nPWI1 deposed that he sustained injury in the incident occurred at Ulloor. He\ndoesn’t remember the date of occurrence. It has been ten years since then. He\nsustained fracture on his head and hand and had gone to Government Medical\nCollege Hospital for treatment. Further he deposed that he gave Exhibit P1\nstatement to the police. He deposed that the incident occurred while he was on\n\nA\nhis way to his workplace. He denied knowledge as to the reason for the incident\nand further that he is not able to identify the person who drove the vehicle and\nthat he doesn’t know if the Accused was the driver or not. He further deposed that\nhe had already filed a Compromise Petition before this Court.\n\nOn going through the evidence and the materials on record, it is pertinent to\nnote that though PW1 admits of having sustained injuries in the incident, he has no\ncase that it was on account of rash or negligent driving of the Accused himself. In\nfact, PW1 categorically deposed that he does not know the Accused and has no\ncase that it was the Accused who had so driven the vehicle as alleged by the\nProsecution so as to implicate him. The presence of occurrence witnesses CWs 2\nand 3 could not be procured by the Prosecution and steps effected against them.\nThe remaining witnesses were given up by the Prosecution as the material witness,\nthe injured himself had turned hostile to the Prosecution and also no purpose\nwould be served in examining the remaining witnesses in the said circumstance.\nThus, there is nothing on record as revealed from the deposition of the witnesses\nso as to implicate the Accused to the alleged incident that the Accused by the\naforesaid acts committed the above offences, having caused PWI1 to sustain\ninjuries. Furthermore, it is admitted by PW1 that already a compromise petition\nwas filed by him. The same was rejected as the offences alleged includes those\nwhich are non-compoundable in nature. The Prosecution has thus failed to\nsubstantiate its case by adducing proper evidence and thereby failed to prove the\nguilt of the Accused beyond reasonable doubt, much less rash or negligent driving\nagainst him. Hence these points are found in favour of the Accused.\n\n9. Point d: In light of analysis of the points hereinabove, since those are found\nin favour of the Accused, no sentence is to be awarded to the Accused.\n\n10. In the result, the Accused is found not guilty of having committed the\noffence punishable under Sections 279, 337 of the IPC r/w 134(b) of Motor\nVehicles Act . Hence, the Accused is acquitted of the said offences under section\n255(1) of CrPC. His bail bond stands canceled and he is set at liberty.\n\n5\n(Dictated to my Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected by\nme and pronounced in open court on this the 18\" day of December, 2024)\nJudicial Magistrate of First Class-I\nThiruvanantha\npuram\nAPPENDIX\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA: Prosecution witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nPW1 Vijayamma(CW1) Occurrence witness\nexamined on 30.11.2024\nB: Defence witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nNil Ns Nil\nC: Court witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\n\n6\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA.
