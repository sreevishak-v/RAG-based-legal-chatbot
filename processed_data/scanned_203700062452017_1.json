The allegation of the de facto complainant, who is\narrayed as the 2™ respondent herein is that after the marriage of\nthe 2\" respondent with the son of the petitioner herein on\n25.08.2013, the petitioner used to sexually harass her.

In the meanwhile, the petitioner has approached this\nCourt to quash the proceedings on a premise that the dispute\narose from a matrimonial discord between the 2\"? respondent and\nher husband, who is the son of the petitioner herein.
