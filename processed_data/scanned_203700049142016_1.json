The 4\" petitioner is the\nowner and 5\" petitioner is the driver of another lorry\nbearing Reg.No.KL-08-AR-7543. These three vehicles\nwere seized by the 2™ respondent on 29.7.2016, alleging\nviolation of the provisions of the Kerala Minerals\n(Prevention of illegal Mining, Storage and Transportation)\nRules, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as “the Transportation\nRules, 2015”). Annexure-Al is the mahazar evidencing\nthe seizure.\n\n—\n2016/KER/33893\nCri.M.C. No.4914 of 2016\n-2-\n\n2.As per Rule 32 of the Transportation Rules, 2015, any\noffence punishable under the said rules can be\ncompounded, either before or after the institution of the\nprosecution, by the person authorized under Section 22 of\nthe Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act,\n1957 or clause (ii) of Rule 2 of the Transportation Rules,\n2015, to make a complaint to the Court with respect to\nthat offence, on payment to that person, for credit to the\nGovernment, of such sum as that person may specify.\nReferring to Annexure-A2, it is submitted that the 3%\nrespondent is the officer authorised to make a complaint\nto the Court or to compound the offence.\n\n3.The grievance of the petitioners is that the vehicles have\nnot been produced before the 3™ respondent till date.

It is evident on a reading of Rule 32 of the\nTransportation Rules, 2015 and also S.R.O No. 375 of\n2015 produced by the petitioners that the 3™ respondent\nis the competent authority to prefer complaint before the\nlearned Magistrate and also to allow the compounding of\nthe offence. Hence, the following directions are issued, to\nsecure the ends of justice :-\n\ni. The 2™ respondent is directed to produce\nthe aforesaid vehicles involved in the offence\nbefore the 3 respondent within a period of\ntwo days from the date of receipt of a copy of\nthis order.\n\nBarer\n—\nBIER;\n2016/KER/33893\nCrI.M.C.

The above endeavour shall be completed\nwithin a period of 5 days from the date of\nreceipt of this order.\nIf the offence is compounded in terms of Rule 32 of the\nTransportation Rules, 2015, necessarily the vehicles\nshall be released forthwith.
