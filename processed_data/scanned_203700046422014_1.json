The case is now pending in committal proceeding\nbefore the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-ll, Ernakulam\nas C.P. No.41 of 2012. The defacto complainant,on whose\ncomplaint the crime was registered, is one Rajan. Now the\npetitioner seeks orders under Section 482 of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure quashing the prosecution against him\non the ground that he and Rajan have come to terms\namicably out of court. The de facto complainant Rajan is\nthe 2\"? respondent in this proceeding. He has filed affidavit\nto the effect that he has settled the dispute with the\naccused, and he has no grievance or complaint. Of course,\nthere are materials to attract Section 326 of I.P.C, but | find\nno definite material for a prosecution under Section 308 of\n1.P.C in this case. There is reason to believe that the said\nsection was incorporated by the Police on the basis of a\n\nmee\niS\nB.S\nbins\n2015/KER/1530\nCrl.M.C No.4642 of 2014\n2\nhypothetical statement.\n\n2. In so many decisions, the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nhas held that even in cases involving non-compoundable\noffences, the High Court can’ quash prosecution, if the\nparties have really settled the dispute, and continuance of\nprosecution will not serve any purpose. Here, | find a real\nand genuine settlement between the parties. In such a\nsituation, it is definite that continuance of prosecution will\nbe a sheer waste of time, because nobody will support the\nprosecution, if the case goes to trial.\n\nIn the result, this petition is allowed. The prosecution\nagainst the petitioner herein in Crime No.3904 of 2011 of\nErnakulam Central Police Station, now pending in committal\nproceeding before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-\nI,Ernakulam as C.P.
