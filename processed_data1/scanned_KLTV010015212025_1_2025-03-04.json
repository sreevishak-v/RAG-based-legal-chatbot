No.643/2025\n(Crime No.127/2025 of Vattiyoorkkavu Police Station)\nPetitioners/Accused Nos. 1 and 2 :-\n1. Abi, aged 25 years,\nS/o Vinod, residing at\nTC.38/2640(3), KRA 126,\nKonathukulangara, Arapura,\nVattiyoorkavu P.O,\nThiruvananthapuram District\n2. Rahul, aged 20 years,\nS/o Remesh, residing at\nFlat No.318, Rajaji Nagar,\nThampanoor Ward, Thycadu Village,\nThiruvananthapuram\nBy Advocates:-K.S. Gopinathan Nair, K.G Rajesh and\nVijayakrishnan.G\nCounter Petitioners:-\n1. State of Kerala\n2. The Station House Officer, Vattiyoorkavu Police Station\nBy Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumary\nThis petition came up for hearing on 03/03/2025 and the court on 04/03/2025\npassed the following :\nCriminal M.C.No.643/2025 1/6\n\nORDER\n\nThis is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik\nSuraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail.\n\n2. The petitioners are alleged to have committed the offences punishable\nunder Sections 126(2), 115(), 117(2) and 118(2), r/w Section 3(5) of the\nBharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, and Crime No. 127/2025 of Vattiyoorkavu Police\nStation is registered against the petitioners arraying them as accused Nos. 1 and 2.\n\n3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- On 07.02.2025 at\nabout 9.45 p.m., inside Surendra Bar, situated at Manchadimoodu, Vattiyoorkavu,\na wordy altercation occurred between the husband of the defacto complainant\nand accused Nos.1 and 2, and thereafter, accused Nos.1 and 2 fisted and beat on\nthe face of the victim, pulled him down and kicked him repeatedly. When the\nvictim went out of the Bar, accused Nos.1 and 2 along with the 3™ accused\nwrongfully restrained him, and at that time, the 1* accused fisted on the face of\nthe victim repeatedly, using an iron bangle, causing fracture to his nasal bone.\nWhen the victim fell down, accused Nos. 2 to 6 beat, fisted and kicked on various\nparts of his body.\n\nCriminal M.C.No.643/2025 2/6\n\n4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The\nInvestigating Officer filed report and additional report opposing the pre-arrest bail\napplication.\n\n5. Heard. Perused the records.\n\n6. The only point to be considered is, whether pre-arrest bail can be\ngranted to the petitioners/accused Nos. 1 and 2.\n\n7. ‘The Point:- The defacto complainant is the wife of the victim. The\npetitioners/ accused Nos. 1 and 2 along with the other accused are alleged to have\nmanhandled and attacked the victim, using an iron bangle, causing injuries. The\nalleged incident has happened inside and outside a Bar, and the motive for the\nincident is the enmity that arose, when a wordy altercation occurred between the\nvictim and the accused persons.\n\n8. According to the petitioners, they are innocent of the allegations\nlevelled against them and they have been falsely implicated in this crime due to\nthe mistaken identity.\n\n9. There is serious allegation as against the petitioners. It is seen from\nthe report filed by the Investigating Officer that, the petitioners/ accused Nos. 1\nand 2 along with the other accused had fisted and beaten the victim, and the 1*\n\nCriminal M.C.No.643/2025 3/6\n\naccused, by using an iron bangle, hit on his face, causing serious injuries. In the\naccident register-cum-wound certificate appended with the report filed by the\nInvestigating Officer, it is seen that, the victim sustained comminuted fracture of\nfrontal process of maxilla, displaced fracture of right nasal bone and undisplaced\nfracture of left nasal bone. It is stated in the report that the wound certificate and\nthe treatment certificate of the victim were obtained. It is also stated in the report\nthat the recovery of the weapon used for the commission of the offence is to be\neffected. The counsel for the petitioners argued that, the petitioners are not\ninvolved in the crime, and in fact, the identity of the petitioners are not stated in\nthe First Information Statement. It is relevant to note that the First Information\nStatement was given by the wife of the injured, who is not connected to this\nincident. Further, the learned Public Prosecutor submitted that the involvement of\nthe accused is made out on verification of the CCTV footage. The Investigating\nOfficer has filed an additional report to that effect stating that the petitioners/\naccused Nos. 1 and 2 are implicated on questioning the friend of the injured and\nalso on verification of CCTV footage. So, the prosecution has made out a prima\nfacie case against the petitioners/ accused Nos. 1 and 2 and regarding the\ninvolvement of the petitioners in the alleged offence. The investigation is\nprogressing. It is stated in the report that the petitioners are involved in other\nCriminal M.C.No.643/2025 4/6\n\ncrimes. Considering the facts stated in the report to the effect that the petitioners\nare involved in the offence, it appears that exceptional jurisdiction to grant a pre-\narrest bail cannot be exercised in this case.\n\n10. In Jai Prakash Singh v. State of Bihar and Another (2012 (4) SCC\n379), the Hon’ble Apex court has held that, an order of pre-arrest bail being an\nextra ordinary privilege, should be granted only in exceptional cases. It is settled\nin law that arrest should be the last option and it should be restricted to cases\nwhere arrest is imperative in the facts and circumstances of a case and consistent\nview is that the grant of anticipatory bail shall be restricted to exceptional\ncircumstances. So it is clear that the power to grant anticipatory bail under section\n482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita is an exceptional power and should\nbe exercised only in exceptional cases and not as a matter of course. Its object is to\nensure that a person should not be harassed or humiliated in order to satisfy the\ngrudge or personal vendetta of the complainant. [Reliance placed on the decision\nrendered by the Hon’ble Apex Court in HDFC Bank Limited v. J.J. Mannan and\nAnother (2010 (1) SCC 679); Srikant Upadhyay v. State of Bihar (2024 KHC\nOnline 6137)]. In the case at hand, I find no exceptional circumstance to exercise\nthe exceptional power of granting anticipatory bail.\n\n11. Considering the serious allegation against the petitioners and gravity\n\nCriminal M.C.No.643/2025 5/6\n\nof the offence, it appears that granting the petitioners with an order of anticipatory\nbail will adversely affect the investigation. If an order of anticipatory bail is\ngranted they are likely to influence the witnesses and tamper with the evidence.\nConsidering all these aspects, this court is not inclined to grant an order of pre-\narrest bail to the petitioners.\nIn the result, this petition is dismissed.\nDictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and pronounced\nby me in Open Court on this the 4\" day of March, 2025.\nSd/-\nNAZEERA.S\nSESSIONS JUDGE\n(Copies : 4) //True Copy// (By Order)\nTyped by: Soumya\nCompared by:Maniusha FCS: SHERISTADAR\nCriminal M.C.No.643/2025 6/6\n\nCopy of Order in\nCriminal M.C.No.643/2025\nDated 04/03/2025\nCriminal M.C.No.643/2025 716\n\n"
