CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n10.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nDiep\nines\nCRL.MC NO. 150 OF 2024 EE\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.\n~CriLM.C. No.150 of 2024\nDated this the 10\" day of January, 2024\nORDER\n\nPetitioner is the 2\"? accused in Crime No.186 of 2011 of\nKadakkavoor Police Station, now pending as C.C No.246 of\n2022 of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-l, Varkala. The\noffences alleged against the petitioner are under Section 342\nread with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.\n\n2. According to the prosecution, the defacto\ncomplainant, who is the Secretary of the Panchayat, was\nwrongfully restrained by accused Nos.1 and 2, since he\nrefused to give a copy of the minutes and thereby, the accused\ncommitted the offences alleged.\n\n3. Sri. Sherry J. Thomas, the learned counsel for the\npetitioner submitted that, the case against the 1** accused was\ncompounded by order dated 08.11.2016 and the benefit of\nsuch compounding ought to be extended to the petitioner as\nwell. She further submitted that, by virtue of compounding of\nthe offences as against the 1* accused, Section 34 of the IPC\n\n2024/KER/1463\nCRL.MC NO. 150 OF 2024\ncannot be attracted as well, and on that basis the case is\nrequired to be quashed. It was further pointed out that, in any\nevent, the 2\" respondent is willing to settle the matter and\ntherefore, the proceedings in the trial court ought to be\nquashed.\n\n4. | have heard Sri. Noushad K.A., learned Public\nProsecutor as well.\n\n5. The prosecution allegation is that, the Panchayat\nSecretary was restrained by the President of the Panchayat as\nwell as a Ward member on 28.03.2011. The case as against the\nPresident of the Panchayat, who was arrayed as the 1* accused\nwas compounded as evident from Annexure-A3_ order.\nHowever, the case against the petitioner, who was a Ward\nmember was not compounded, which indicates that the\n2\" respondent intended to proceed against the petitioner.\n\n6. Though the case against the 1* accused has been\ncompounded, the same by itself cannot wipe away the offence\nunder Section 342 of the IPC. Of course whether Section 34 of\nIPC would be applicable due to the compounding is a matter to\nbe considered after trial. The allegations in the final report\nindicates the commission of an offence, at least, prima facie,\n\n2024/KER/1463\nCRL.MC NO. 150 OF 2024\nwhether any offence is proved or not is a matter to be decided\nafter evidence is adduced.\n\nConsidering the fact that, the crime is of the year 2011\nand till date, no settlement has been arrived at between the\npetitioner and the defacto complainant, it is not proper for this\nCourt to issue notice to enquire whether the 2\"Â¢ respondent is\nwilling to settle the matter or not.\n\nTherefore, | find no merit in this Criminal M.C.,and it is\ndismissed.\n\nSd/-\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\nLU\n\nBel\nBiren\n2024/KER/1463\nCRL.MC NO. 150 OF 2024\n..5..\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 150/2024\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES :\nANNEXURE A21 THE CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FIR, DATED\n31-03-2011 IN CRIME NO. 186/2011\nANNEXURE A2 THE CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT\nDATED 8-7-2011 IN FIR NO 186/2011\nANNEXURE A3 THE CERTIFIED COPY OF THE ORDER DATED\n08-11-2016 IN CC NO. 642/2011\nACQUITTING THE 1ST ACCUSED\n// True Copy // PA To Judge\n\n"
