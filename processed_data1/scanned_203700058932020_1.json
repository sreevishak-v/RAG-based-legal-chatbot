Petitioners are the accused Nos.1 to 5 in\nCrime No.1175 of 2020 of Quilandy Police Station\nregistered for the offences punishable under\nSections 406, 498(A)and 34 of Indian Penal Code.\n\n3. The learned counsel appearing for the\npetitioners have submitted that the first\npetitioner, who is the first accused has married\nthe defacto complainant and they resided together\nas husband and wife for sometime. But due to the\ndifference of opinion, they separated and\nsubsequently their marriage has been dissolved by a\ndecree of divorce by the Family Court, Vadakara in\nO.P.No.482 of 2020.\n\n4. It is also submitted that now the entire\ndispute between the parties have been settled out\n\npee awalC\ni\nCrl.MC.No.5893 OF 2020 202 1/KER/S68\n4\nof court and all her belongings have been returned\nto her as per the terms of the settlement.\nTherefore, it is quite unnecessary to proceed with\nthe case registered against the petitioners on some\nmisunderstanding by the defacto complainant.\n\n5. Heard the learned counsel for the\npetitioners, respondent as well the learned Public\nProsecutor.\n\n6. The learned Public Prosecutor has also\nsubmitted that the entire dispute between the\nparties have been amicably settled and as such the\ndefacto complainant has no grievance or complaints\nagainst these petitioners.\n\n7. On going through the- entire records\nproduced by the petitioners as well on hearing both\nsides, I find that no fruitful purpose is likely to\nbe served by pursuing the matter against these\npetitioners. Moreover, no public interest is\ninvolved in the case and there is no _ legal\nimpediment in granting the prayer as sought for by\nthe petitioners. As, the entire dispute has been\n\nBera\nSe\nes E\nCr1.MC.No.5893 OF 2020 2021/KER/368\n5\n\namicably settled the request to quash the FIR\n\nregistered against these petitioners can be allowed\n\nas prayed for by the petitioners.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, this Crl.M.C is\nallowed and Crime No.1175 of 2020 of Quilandy\nPolice Station registered against these petitioners\nshall stand quashed as prayed for.\n\nSd/-\nSHIRCY V.\nJUDGE\nSMA\n\nDey\nBette\nCrl.MC.No.5893 OF 2020 202 U/KER/B68\n6\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE-TI TRUE COPY OF THE FIRST INFORMATION\nREPORT IN CRIME NO.1175/20 OF QUILANDY\nPOLICE STATION.\nANNEXURE-ITI SWORN AFFIDAVIT OF 1ST RESPONDENT.\nRESPONDENT (S)' EXHIBITS :- NIL\n//TRUE COPY//\nPA TO JUDGE\n\n"
