Petitioners are the accused in C.C.No.476/2021 on the files\nof the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Parappanangadi, arising\nout of Crime No.995/2020 of Parappanangadi Police Station,\nMalappuram District, registered for the offences under Sections 143,\n147, 341, 323 and 324 r/w Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code,\n1860. Respondents 2 and 3 are the defacto complainant and the\ninjured witness.\n\n3. According to the prosecution, the accused formed\nthemselves into unlawful assembly and assaulted the defacto\ncomplainant with bamboo stick and thereby committed the offences\nalleged.\n\n4. Heard the learned Counsel for the petitioners and the\nlearned Counsel for the respondents apart from the learned Public\nProsecutor.\n\n5. The learned Counsel for the petitioners submitted that the\nmatter has been settled and hence the proceedings against the\npetitioners ought to be quashed. It was also submitted that,\n\nPut\n2024/KER/4535\nCRL.MC NO. 262 OF 2024\n4\nconsidering the nature of offences alleged, no purpose would be\nserved by continuing the proceedings.\n\n6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303],\nthe Apex Court has held that in appropriate cases, the High Court can\ntake note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim\nand the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. This\nview was reiterated in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6\nSCC 466] and Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State of Jharkhand\nand Another [(2014) 9 SCC 653].\n\n7. | have perused Annexure 2 affidavit filed by respondents 2\nand 3.

There is no impediment for granting\nthe prayer for quashing. The continuance of the proceedings will only\nbe an exercise in futility.\n\n8.
