In this petition, it is stated that the petitioner was\nenlarged on bail during the crime stage and subsequently after\nthe appearance before the court below, he was enlarged on\nbail. Thereafter, the petitioner got an employment abroad and\ntherefore he could not appear before the court below when\nsummons was issued to him. Consequently, his bail bond was\ncancelled and a non bailable warranted was issued against\nhim. Now the case against the first accused stands posted to\n2.5.2015.\n\nEpes Shed)\nis rae reg\n2015/KER/17261\nCri.M.C. No. 2491 of 2015\n-~2-\n\n3. Though he is willing to appear before the court\nbelow, he reasonably apprehends that his bail application will\nnot be considered by the court below on the date of his\nappearance itself and he may be remanded to Judicial Custody,\npending consideration of the bail application.\n\n4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner.\n\n5. The learned counsel for the petitioner urged for a\ndirection to the learned magistrate to consider the application\non the date of his appearance itself.\n\nI do not think that the Learned Magistrate will adopt such\na method mechanically without application of mind to see that\nthe petitioner is incarcerated. However, to secure the interest\nof Justice, the learned Magistrate is directed to dispose of the\nbail application on the date of appearance itself.\n\nSd/-\nK. HARILAL\nJUDGE\nScl.
