The wife of the petitioner herein filed a complaint\nalleging matrimonial cruelty against the petitioner herein and the\nin-laws. After investigation, final report was laid and the matter is\npending as C.C.No.391/2001. Since the petitioner herein was not\navailable for trial, the other accused faced the trial and they were\nacquitted. The case against the petitioner herein was split up and\nis now pending as C.C.No.1257/2013.\n\n3. The petitioner claims that, he was employed abroad\nand was out of station in connection with his employment. He\ncontends that, he has never ran away from the jurisdiction of the\ncourt and is ready and willing to surrender before the competent\ncourt. However, his apprehension is that, if an application for bail\nis filed, it is not likely to be taken up on the same day and he is\nlikely to be remanded.\n\nee\n2016/KER/33891\n\nCri. M. C.
