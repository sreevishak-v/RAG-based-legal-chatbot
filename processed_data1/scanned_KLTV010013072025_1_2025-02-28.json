No.523/2025\n(Crime No.150/2025 of Aruvikkara Police Station)\n\nPetitioner/Accused No.8:-\n\nSudha Devi.S, aged 55 years,\n\nW/o late M Mohankumar,\n\nKrishnaKripa, Mundela P.O,\n\nAruvikkara, Thiruvananthapuram-695543\n\nBy Advocates:-Sonay John, Soniya.S, Jobin J Abraham,\nR.B. Rahul Raj and Rohit.R\nCounter Petitioners:-\n1. State of Kerala\n2. The Inspector of Police, Aruvikkara Police Station, Thiruvananthapuram\nBy Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumary\n\nThis petition came up for hearing on 25/02/2025 and the court on 28/02/2025\n\npassed the following :\nORDER\n\nThis is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik\nSuraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail.\n\n2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable\nunder Sections 409 and 420, r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, and Crime\n\nCriminal M.C.No.523/2025 1/6\n\nNo. 150/2025 of Aruvikkara Police Station is registered against the petitioner/ 8\"\naccused.\n\n3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- The accused Nos. 1\nto 16, who were the staff of Rajiv Gandhi Residents’ Welfare Co-operative Society\nsituated in Nedumangadu Taluk, in furtherance of their common intention to obtain\nwrongful gain and to cause wrongful loss to the depositors in the Society, during\nthe period from 01.04.2021 to 31.05.2024, committed misappropriation in the\ndeposits, and obtained a total sum of Rs.24,74,21,480/- from them.\n\n4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The\nInvestigating Officer filed report opposing the anticipatory bail application. Case\nDiary is produced.\n\n5. Heard. Perused the records.\n\n6. The only point to be considered is, whether an order of anticipatory\nbail can be granted to the petitioner/ 8\" accused.\n\n7. ‘The Point:- The petitioner is the wife of the 1* accused and she is\narrayed as the 8\" accused. The 1“ accused was the President of Rajiv Gandhi\nResidents’ Welfare Co-operative Society. The petitioner / 8\" accused was an\nemployee of Thiruvananthapuram Service Co-operative Society. The defacto\n\nCriminal M.C.No.523/2025 2/6\n\ncomplainant was the Part-Time Administrator of Rajiv Gandhi Residents’ Welfare\nCo-operative Society. The prosecution allegation is that, the accused persons have\ncommitted misappropriation of around Rs.24,74,21,480/- by taking loan in benami\nnames and by way of advance MDS. The specific allegation against petitioner / 8\"\naccused is that, she had pledged the property in her name as security for obtaining\ndifferent loans and MDS.\n\n8. The petitioner submits that, she is working as a Clerk in the\nThiruvananthapuram Service Co-operative Bank, and is not having any criminal\nantecedents. It is submitted that, the husband of the petitioner, M.Mohankumar,\nwho was the President of the Rajiv Gandhi Residents’ Welfare Co-operative\nSociety, Mundela, and a well-known political figure, committed suicide on\n20.11.2024, after being falsely accused of misappropriating funds from the said\nSociety, and since then, the family of the petitioner is under threat from the\nmembers of various political parties, and many individuals claim to have\ndeposited exorbitant amounts in the Society and are now targeting the petitioner\nand her family. It is also submitted that, more than 60 F.I.Rs have been registered\nagainst the office bearers of the Society based on various complaints, however, the\npetitioner was never named as an accused in any of those F.I-Rs., since she did not\nhold any post in the said Society. The petitioner submitted that, thereafter, on\n\nCriminal M.C.No.523/2025 3/6\n\n06.02.2025, the Aruvikkara Police registered an F.I.R. against the petitioner and\n15 others, including her late husband, alleging misappropriation of over Rs. 24\nCrores from the Society, and that was due to political pressure with the sole\nintention of harassing the petitioner and her family. She further submitted that, the\nessential ingredients required to establish the offence under Section 420 IPC are\nabsent in this case, since there was no intention to deceive anyone.\n\n9. The allegation against the petitioner is not grave. The allegation\nagainst the petitioner is misappropriation of amount deposited by the depositors.\nOn perusal of the Case Diary, it is seen that, when a search was conducted in the\nNedumangadu Employees Service Co-operative Bank, where the husband of the\npetitioner was the President, some documents in the name of the petitioner and\nagreements were seized. No other materials are placed against the petitioner. The\npetitioner’s counsel contended that, no property was in the name of the petitioner.\nEven if some documents were found in the name of the petitioner, the relevance of\nthe same in the implication of the crime and the dishonest intention of the\npetitioner is a matter of evidence. The exact role of the petitioner is not brought\nout by the prosecution. It appears that there is no prima facie case against the\npetitioner. It would be a travesty of justice, if the petitioner is put behind the bars,\n\nCriminal M.C.No.523/2025 4/6\n\nif she has not committed any offence. No criminal antecedents of the petitioner is\nbrought to the notice of this court.\n\n10. In view of my discussion above, it appears that there is no\nimpediment in granting a pre-arrest bail to the petitioner. Considering all these\naspects, it is found that this is a fit case where a pre-arrest bail can be granted to\nthe petitioner.\n\nIn the result, the petition is allowed on the following conditions:-\n\n(1) In the event of arrest, the petitioner/ 8\" accused shall be\nreleased on bail on her executing bond for Rs.50,000/-\n(Rupees Fifty Thousand only) with two solvent sureties for\nthe like sum each to the satisfaction of the arresting\nofficer/Investigating Officer, as the case may be.\n\n(2) Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer\nbetween 10 a.m. and 11 am. on every Wednesday for a\nperiod of 3 (three) months or till the filing of the final report,\nwhichever is earlier.\n\n(3) Petitioner shall also appear before the Investigating Officer as\nand when required.\n\n(4) Petitioner shall not commit any offence while on bail.\n\n(5) Petitioner shall not attempt to contact the defacto complainant\nor any of the prosecution witnesses, directly or through any\n\nCriminal M.C.No.523/2025 5/6\n\nother person, or in any other way try to tamper with the\n\nevidence or influence any witnesses or other persons related\n\nto the investigation.\n\nIn case of any violation of the above conditions or misuse of liberty,\nthe prosecution or the defacto complainant is at liberty to approach jurisdictional\ncourt for cancellation of bail.\n\n(Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and\npronounced by me in Open Court on this the 28\" day of February 2025)\nSd/-\nNAZEERA.S\nSESSIONS JUDGE\n\n(Copies : 4) //True Copy// (By Order)\n\nTyped by: Soumya\n\nCompared bv: Rifa FCS: SHERISTADAR\n\nCriminal M.C.No.523/2025 6/6\n\nCopy of Order in\nCriminal M.C.No.523/2025\nDated 28/02/2025\nCriminal M.C.No.523/2025 716\n\n"
