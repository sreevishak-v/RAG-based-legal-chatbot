P.S.TO JUDGE\n\nBE\napa\n2017/KER/49781\nB. KEMAL PASHA, J.\nDated this the 8\" day of December, 2017\nORDER\nPetitioners are the accused in Annexure-! private\ncomplaint filed before the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court,\nKalpetta, which was referred to the police under Section 156\n(3) Cr.PC., on the basis of which the police promptly\nregistered Annexure-Il FIR for the offence under Section\n420 read with Section 34 IPC.\n\n2. The facts are very strange. The de _ facto\ncomplainant in Annexure-ll and the 2\" petitioner herein\nwere the partners of a partnership firm named 'Wayanad\nEstates’. The firm has a huge extent of properties, and the\n2™ petitioner was the share holder of 73% of shares in the\npartnership. Alleging that 1° respondent herein, who is the\n\nBal\n2017/KER/49781\n\nCrl.M.C.7927/2016 >.\n\nde facto complainant in Annexure-ll, had forged and\nfabricated documents showing that the 2\" petitioner has\nretired from the said partnership, the 2\" petitioner preferred\n\na complaint before the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court,\nKalpetta, on the basis of which Annexure-V FIR was\nregistered in Crime No.422/2016 of Meppadi Police Station.\nImmediately thereafter, Annexure-| complaint was preferred\n\nby the de facto complainant in Annexure-Il and got Crime\nNo.505/2016 registered.\n\n3. The petitioners have produced documents to\nshow that the forged deed of retirement allegedly fabricated\nby the 1 respondent herein was produced before the\nRegistrar of Firms to see that the retirement is recorded.\nNotice was issued by the Registrar of Firms to the 2\"\npetitioner. The 2™ petitioner immediately preferred\nobjections on the basis of which, Annexure-lll order was\npassed by the Registrar of Firms and information was\npassed on to the 2\" petitioner. The Registrar of Firms took\n\nBal\n2017/KER/49781\nCrl.M.C.7927/2016 4.\nthe view that there was no retirement and therefore, the\nretirement was not recorded.\n\n4. On-going through Annexure-Il as well as\nAnnexure-l, it seems that the allegation is that after\nobtaining the entire amounts towards the share of the 2\"\npetitioner from the 1* respondent, she has retracted from\nthe transfer and by alleging falsehood, preferred the\ncomplaint in respect of Annexure-V FIR. On the said\nallegation, an offence under Section 420 IPC read with\nSection 34 IPC has been incorporated in Annexure-ll FIR.\n\n5. On hearing either side, it has come out that\nAnnexure-| complaint as well as Annexure-ll FIR are quite\nunnecessary and the same were just as a retaliatory\nmeasure to the actions initiated by the 2™ petitioner, who is\na 75 year old woman. Matters being so, all further\nproceedings in Crime No.505/2016 based on Annexure-ll\nand Annexure-| are liable to be quashed.\n\nIn the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-|\n\nPeas\napo\n2017/KER/49781\nCrl.M.C.7927/2016\n14:\ncomplaint and Annexure-ll FIR in Crime No.505/2016 of\nMeppadi Police Station and all further proceedings as\nagainst the petitioners in it, are quashed.\nSd/-\n(B.KEMAL PASHA, JUDGE)\naks/08/12\n// True Copy //\nPS to Judge\n\n"
