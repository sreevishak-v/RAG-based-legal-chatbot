Considering the fact that the petitioner belongs to\nWest Bengal, he was granted bail by Annexure Al order dated\n31/3/2014 subject to several conditions inter alia that he shall\nexecute a bond for a sum of Rs.3,00,000/- with two sureties\neach. Thereafter, he approached this Court by filing\nCri.M.C.No.8031/2015 contending that the condition imposed\nby that Court was too onerous and sought for relaxation of the\ncondition. By Annexure A2, this court modified the condition\nNo. 1 in Annexure Al with regard to one surety, inter alia, by\ndirecting that any resident of Kerala be a relative or not, can\nbe accepted by the court, if that surety is solvent to the extent\nof Rs. 3 Lakhs fixed by the trial court.\n\n3. The petitioner herein has again approached this court\ncontending that even after the modified order passed by this\n\nPlsipias\n2016/KER/33876\nCri.M.C.No.4267/2016 2\nCourt on 23/12/2015, still the petitioner could not find two\nsureties who are willing to offer themselves as sureties for\nthe bond amount of Rs.3 Lakhs.\n\n4. It is evident that in spite of a favourable order, the\npetitioner herein could not obtain sureties for execution of\nbond of Rs. 3 Lakhs. It seems that the above condition has\nbecome unworkable as far asâ€™ the petitioner herein is\nconcerned. Hence, I feel that a lenient view is liable to be\ntaken and the bond amount ordered to be executed by the\nsureties is slashed down to Rs. One Lakhs each. All other\nconditions will remain. In the event of the petitioner herein\nagain finding difficulty in executing a bond as above, the\ncourt below shall expedite the trial having regard to the fact\nthat the petitioner herein is under trial.\n\nCrl.M.C.is disposed of with the above directions.\n\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS\nJudge\ndpk\n/true copy/ PS to Judge.\n\nIps\nBe\n2016/KER/33876\nCrl.M.C.No.4267/2016 3\n\n"
