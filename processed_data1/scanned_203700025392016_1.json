On the basis of the complaint lodged, crime was\nregistered and the matter is now pending as C.C.No.274/2009\nbefore the Judicial First Class Magistrate - Il, Perinthalmanna.\nAccording to the parties, the dispute between the parties has\nbeen settled amicably and a compromise has been arrived at. It\nwas submitted by both sides that they do not propose to proceed\nwith the case. Annexure B to F are the affidavits sworn to by\nrespondents 2 to 6 herein who are the victims/injured.\n\n3. It was brought to my notice that a counter case was\nalso initiated as Crime No.61/2009 resulting in C.C. No.275/2009\nof the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-ll, Perinthalmanna. It\nwas submitted by both sides that the above case was quashed by\norder of this Court in crl.M.C. No.1925/2016 dated 08.04.2016.
