According to the petitioner, pursuant to the final\nreport filed, cognizance was taken and summons was issued to\nhim. Since he was away in connection with his employment, he\ncould not appear before the court below.\n\n2. The petitioner submits that he is ready and willing to\nappear before the court below, submit himself to the jurisdiction\nand to participate in all future proceedings personally or through\nhis counsel. However, his apprehension is that since warrant has\nbeen issued, the court below is not likely to take up the\napplications to recall warrant and for bail on the same day of his\nappearance and he is likely to be remanded.\n\n3. Having considered the limited prayer sought by the\npetitioner herein, notwithstanding the fact that he is involved in\ntwo other cases of similar nature, still, to meet the ends of justice\n\nBee\nape\n2018/KER/723\nCri. M. C. No. 8526 of 2017 2\nand to facilitate an early conclusion of the trial, | am inclined to\npermit the petitioner to surrender before the court below within\n10 days from today. If he surrenders within 10 days from today\nand files applications for bail and to recall warrant, the same shall\nbe considered by the court below on the same day itself. The\nwarrant, if any issued from the court below will be kept in\nabeyance till his actual date of appearance within the above 10\ndays.\nCrl.M.C. is disposed of accordingly.\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE.\n/true copy/\nP.
