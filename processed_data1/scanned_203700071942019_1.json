JUSTICE ASHOK MENON\nMONDAY, THE O6TH DAY OF JANUARY 2020 / 16TH POUSHA, 1941\nCr1.MC.No.7194 OF 2019 (H)\nAGAINST THE ORDER/JUDGMENT IN CRLMC 1872/2019 OF\nSESSIONS COURT, ERNAKULAM\nCRIME NO.897/2019 OF NEDUMBASSERY POLICE STATION ,\nErnakulam\nPETITIONER/ACCUSED :\nJASWINDER SINGH,\nAGED 29 YEARS\nS/O.KULWINDER SINGH, H.NO.147, GALI NO.6,\nSANT AVENUE G.T.ROAD, DIVISION B, POLICE\nCOMMISSIONERATE, AMRITHSAR, PUNJAB.\nBY ADVS.\nSRI.C.D.JOHNY\nSRI.LIFFY P. FRANCIS\nRESPONDENT:\nSTATE OF KERALA,\nREPRESENTED BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR,\nHIGH COURT OF KERALA AT ERNAKULAM.\nRAMESH CHAND-PP\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION\nON 06.01.2020, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE\nFOLLOWING:\n\noe\n2020/KER/104\nCrl.MC.No.7194 OF 2019 (H)\n2\nORDER\nDated this the 6th day of January 2020\n\nThe petitioner is an accused in\nCrime No.897/2019 of Nedumbassery Police\nStation, for having allegedly committed\noffences punishable under Sections 468 and 471\nof the IPC and r/w Section 12(1)(b) of the\nPassport Act.\n\n2. Vide order dated 27.08.2019, the\npetitioner was granted bail by the Sessions\nCourt on certain conditions. The petitioner has\nbeen following the conditions so far. The\npetitioner filed a Crl.M.P.2384/2019 before the\nSessions Court for modifying the condition\nNos.3 and 7, but the same was rejected by the\ncourt. Condition Nos.3 and 7 reads thus:\n\n“3. The petitioner shall appear before the\nInvestigating Officer on every Saturday\nbetween 9 a.m. andi10a.m, till the final\n\noe\n2020/KER/104\nCrl.MC.No.7194 OF 2019 (H)\n3\nreport is filed.\n7. The petitioner shall not leave Ernakulam\n\nDistrict without getting prior permission of\n\nthis court.”\n\n3. The petitioner hails from Punjab, and\nfinds it difficult to appear before the\ninvestigating officer on every Saturday between\n9 a.m and 10 a.m as required in condition No.3.\nCondition No.7 also insist that he shall not\nleave Ernakulam without getting permission of\nthe court.\n\n4. The petitioner has approached this Court\nstating that, the order of the Sessions Court\nat Annexure-Al specifically states that, no\noffence under Section 468 of the IPC is\nattracted. If that being so what is attracted\nis only non bailable offence and imposing of\nsuch conditions to appear before the\ninvestigating officer every week and creating\n\noe\n\n2020/KER/104\n\nCrl.MC.No.7194 OF 2019 (H)\n4\n\nan embargo on leaving the district would amount\nto refusal of the bail and therefore, such\nconditions cannot be imposed in a bailable\noffence.\n\n5. Heard learned counsel appearing for the\npetitioner and the learned senior Public\nProsecutor.\n\n6. The petitioner hails from Punjab, and on\nthe apprehension that he may not be available\nfor trial, the court imposed certain conditions\nwhile granting him bail. It is true that the\ncourt has expressed a view that Section 468 of\nthe IPC may not be attracted considering the\nfacts and circumstances of the case. However,\nthe argument of the learned counsel that no\nconditions at all can be imposed where the\noffence is bailable is not acceptable to this\nCourt.\n\n|\n2020/KER/104\nCrl.MC.No.7194 OF 2019 (H)\n5\n\n7. However, I find that the investigation\nhas progressed well and the petitioner has been\ncomplying with the conditions so far without\nfail. The learned Public Prosecutor also\nsubmits that the investigation is almost\ncomplete and the final report will be filed\nwithin a short period. The conditions are also\nto be complied only till the final report is\nfiled.\n\nConsidering the facts and circumstances of\nthe case, I find that, the condition No.3\nrequiring the appearance of the petitioner\nbefore the investigating officer on every\nSaturday shall be relaxed and the petitioner\nshall hereinafter appear before the\ninvestigating officer once in two months. The\ncondition No.7 preventing him from leaving\nErnakulam District is also lifted. The\n\ni\n2020/KER/104\nCrl.MC.No.7194 OF 2019 (H)\n6\ninvestigating officer is directed file a final\nreport expeditiously.\nThe Crl.M.C is disposed of as above.\nSd/-\nASHOK MENON\nJUDGE\nSPK\n\nBese]\n|\nBeer\n2020/KER/104\nCr1l.MC.No.7194 OF 2019 (H)\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE 1 THE TRUE COPY OF THE BAIL ORDER OF\nSESSIONS COURT ERNAKULAM IN\nCRL.M.C.1872/019 DT. 27/08/2019.\nANNEXURE 2 THE CERTIFIED COPY OF THE ORDER OF\nSESSIONS COURT ERNAKULAM IN\nCRL.MP.2384/2019 DATED 05/10/2019.\nRESPONDENT'S/S EXHIBITS:NIL\n\n"
