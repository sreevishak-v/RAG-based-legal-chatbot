ANNEXURES:\nNIL\n//TRUE COPY//\nP.A TO JUDGE\nab\n\nBAe Bl\n2015/KER/1263\nP.UBAID, J.\nDated this the 12\" day of January, 2015\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner herein is the registered owner of the Car\nNo.KL-01-AJ 1881. In Crime No.1120/2013 the Parasalla Police\nseized the said vehicle and produced it in court. The petitioner herein\nmade a claim under Section 451 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for\ninterim custody of the vehicle, and the respondents also made a rival\nclaim. The petitioner's claim was filed as C.M.P No.13731/2014 and\nthe respondents claim was filed as C.M.P No.13732/2014.\n\n2. After hearing both sides, the learned Judicial First\nClass Magistrate Court II, Neyyattinkara allowed the petitioner's\napplication on certain conditions, and further directed that in case the\npetitioner failed to comply with the conditions, the vehicle will be\nreleased to the respondent. That particular part of the order making\nan alternative option for release of the vehicle under Section 451 of\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure is under challenge. Practically the\norder is in favour of the petitioner, and of course he will have to\ncomply with some conditions. It is not known whether the respondent\nhas brought proceeding, challenging the said order. In fact the\n\nBAe Bl\n2015/KER/1263\n\nCrl.M.C No.163 of 2015 2\nrespondent cannot be said to be a beneficiary of the said order\nbecause she will get the vehicle, even if such order could be enforced,\nonly when the petitioner failed to comply with the conditions. When\nthe court makes an order under Section 451 of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure, for interim custody of a property, the order must be\ndefinite and it must be in favour of the person who has right to posses\nthe property, either subject to final decision under Section 452 of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure, or subject to decision by a competent\ncivil court. Here it is submitted that a civil case is pending. So final\ndecision will have to be taken by the civil court. No doubt, the\npetitioner will have the right to possess the vehicle as the registered\nowner of the vehicle. If so, the court below, exercising the powers\nunder Section 451 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, cannot direct\nrelease of the vehicle to somebody else once it is found that the\npetitioner is the right person to possess the vehicle. If he wants the\nvehicle he will definitely comply with the conditions. If he doesn't\ncomply with the conditions the vehicle will continue in court custody.\nI find that the second part of the order under challenge is liable to be\nset aside, and the vehicle will have to be released to the petitioner, on\ncompliance of the conditions.\n\n3. The petitioner is also aggrieved by one of the\nconditions, directing him to deposit %6 lakhs before the court. It is not\n\nBAe Bl\n2015/KER/1263\n\nCrl.M.C No.163 of 2015 3\n\nknown why such a condition is imposed by the court below.\nAdmittedly, the petitioner is the registered owner of the vehicle and\nthe respondent claims possession on the contention that some money\nwas advanced by her to purchase the vehicle. This is a matter to be\nlooked and decided by the civil court. As the registered owner the\npetitioner has every right to possess the vehicle without being\nquestioned by anybody. The other conditions imposed by the court\nbelow will serve the purpose in the present circumstances. It would\n\nbe unjust and inappropriate to direct deposit of %6 lakhs as a condition\n\nfor getting custody of the vehicle. In the result, this Criminal\nMiscellaneous Case is allowed, as follows:\n\ni) The second condition imposed by the court\nbelow directing deposit of %6 lakhs will stand set aside.\n\nii) The second part of the impugned order\ndirecting release of the vehicle to the respondent in case the\npetitioner failed to comply with the directions, will also stand\nset aside.\n\nP.UBAID\nJUDGE\nab\n\n"
