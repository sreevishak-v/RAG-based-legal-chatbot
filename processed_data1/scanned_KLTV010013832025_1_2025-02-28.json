No.566/2025\n(Crime No.179/2025 of Kadinamkulam Police Station)\n\nPetitioner/Accused :-\n\nBasharulla. M aged 45 years,\n\nS/o Mohammed Illias,\n\nresiding at Oottuvilakam,\n\nPerumathura, Thiruvananthapuram District\n\nBy Advocate:-S. Binukumar\n\nCounter Petitioner/Respondent:-\n\nThe Station House Officer, Kadinamkulam Police Station\n\nBy Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumary\n\nThis petition came up for hearing on 25/02/2025 and the court on 28/02/2025\n\npassed the following :\nORDER\nThis is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya\n\nNagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail.\n\n2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed an offence punishable\nunder Section 318(4) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, and Crime No. 179/2025 of\n\nCriminal M.C.No.566/2025 1/5\n\nKadinamkulam Police Station is registered against the petitioner arraying him as\nthe accused.\n\n3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- The accused, with\nan intention to obtain wrongful gain and to cause wrongful loss to the Jama-Ath,\nwhile acting as its General Secretary, from 11.03.2023 to 25.09.2024,\nmisappropriated a sum of Rs.1,09,144/- in the fund. Thereafter, the accused\nremitted back only a sum of Rs.20,000/- to the account of the Jama-Ath\nCommittee, and not remitted the balance amount of Rs.89,144/-, and thereby\ncommitted cheating.\n\n4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The\nInvestigating Officer filed report opposing the anticipatory bail application.\n\n5. Heard. Perused the records.\n\n6. The only point to be considered is, whether an order of anticipatory\nbail can be granted to the petitioner/ accused.\n\n7. â€˜The Point:- The petitioner/accused was the General Secretary of the\nMuslim Jama-Ath Committee, Perumathura. The petitioner / accused is alleged to\nhave misappropriated a sum of Rs.1,09,144/- in the fund of Jama-Ath Committee,\n\nCriminal M.C.No.566/2025 2/5\n\nand on detecting the said misappropriation, he remitted back an amount of\nRs.20,000/- and not remitted the balance amount of Rs.89,144/-.\n\n8. The petitioner submits that, he is absolutely innocent of the\nallegations levelled against him. It is submitted that, the petitioner held the post as\nDistrict Working President of Indian National League and General Secretary of\nPerumathura Muslim Jama-Ath, during the period from March 2023 to November\n2024, and while so, a lady had lodged a complaint against the President of the\nJama-Ath alleging sexual harassment, and since no action was taken by the police,\nhe criticized the concerned police officials, while attending a channel discussion,\nand infuriated by this, the President and present Secretary of the Jama-Ath raised\nfalse allegations, including misappropriation of money from Jama-Ath, against the\npetitioner, and influenced the police, and thereafter, falsely implicated him in the\npresent crime.\n\n9. There is no serious allegation as against the petitioner. Allegedly, in\nthe capacity of the General Secretary of the Muslim Jama-Ath Committee, he had\nmisappropriated the money collected by him. There is no materials on record to\nsubstantiate the allegations in the petition. So there is no prima facie case against\nthe petitioner. The involvement of the petitioner in the alleged offence is not\nbrought out by the prosecution at this stage. It is stated in the report filed by the\n\nCriminal M.C.No.566/2025 3/5\n\nInvestigating Officer that applications were filed for getting the account details. It\nis not stated that there is anything to recover from the petitioner/accused. It would\nbe a travesty of justice, if the petitioner is put behind bars, if actually no offence is\ncommitted by him. Considering all these aspects, it appears that this is a fit case\nwhere pre-arrest bail can be granted to the petitioner.\n\n10. In view of my discussion above, it appears that there is no\nimpediment in granting a pre-arrest bail to the petitioner. Considering all these\naspects, it is found that this is a fit case where a pre-arrest bail can be granted to\nthe petitioner.\n\nIn the result, the petition is allowed on the following conditions:-\n\n(1) In the event of arrest, the petitioner/ accused shall be released\non bail on her executing bond for Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty\nThousand only) with two solvent sureties for the like sum\neach to the satisfaction of the arresting officer/Investigating\nOfficer, as the case may be.\n\n(2) Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer\nbetween 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. on every Thursday for a period\nof 3 (three) months or till the filing of the final report,\nwhichever is earlier.\n\nCriminal M.C.No.566/2025 4/5\n\n(3) Petitioner shall also appear before the Investigating Officer as\nand when required.\n\n(4) Petitioner shall not commit any offence while on bail.\n\n(5) Petitioner shall not attempt to contact the defacto complainant\n\nor any of the prosecution witnesses, directly or through any\n\nother person, or in any other way try to tamper with the\n\nevidence or influence any witnesses or other persons related\n\nto the investigation.\n\nIn case of any violation of the above conditions or misuse of liberty,\nthe prosecution or the defacto complainant is at liberty to approach jurisdictional\ncourt for cancellation of bail.\n\n(Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and\npronounced by me in Open Court on this the 28\" day of February 2025)\nSd/-\nNAZEERA.S\nSESSIONS JUDGE\n\n(Copies : 4) //True Copy// (By Order)\n\nTyped by: Soumya\n\nCompared by: Rifa FCS : SHERISTADAR\n\nCriminal M.C.No.566/2025 5/5\n\nCopy of Order in\nCriminal M.C.No.566/2025\nDated 28/02/2025\nCriminal M.C.No.566/2025 6/5\n\n"
