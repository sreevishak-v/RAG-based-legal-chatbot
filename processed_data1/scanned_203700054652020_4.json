The prosecution allegation is that by about 2 p.m on\n8.5.2018, the petitioner was found in front of Kilikolloor Police Station,\nin an inebriated and quarrelsome condition, which was likely to cause\nbreach of peace. The petitioner seeks to get the further proceedings in\nthe case against him quashed primarily on the ground that even if the\nallegations are accepted in their entirety, the alleged offence was not\nmade out.\n\n2. Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that in order to\nattract the offence under Section 118(a) of the Kerala Police Act, the\naccused should have been in a public place and in an intoxicated\nmanner or rioting condition or incapable of looking after himself.\nReferring to Annexure II final report, it is contended that the allegation\nis only of petitioner being found in a quarrelsome condition, unable to\n\nBese tal\nOR ore\nCr1.MC.5465/2020 3 202 U/KER/813\nstand on his own and using abusive language. It is submitted that the\ndefinition of the term 'rioting' not being available under the Kerala\nPolice Act, the definition provided under Section 146 of IPC ought to\nbe adopted. It is further contended that, unless blood test is conducted\nand the alcohol content in the blood found to be in excess of the\npermitted level, a person cannot be held to be in an intoxicated\ncondition. It is pointed out that even going by the prosecution case,\nonly breath analyzer test was conducted, for which also there is no\ndocumentary evidence. The learned counsel submitted that the\npetitioner has been advised for appointment as Police Constable and\nwas not sent for training on account of his implication in the criminal\ncase.\n\n3. | find substantial force in the contentions urged by the learned\ncounsel. A vague allegation of the petitioner being found in a\nquarrelsome condition will not attract the offence under Section\n118(a). There is essential difference between quarrelsome and rioting\nconditions. Further, there is no evidence to prove that the petitioner\nwas in an intoxicated condition, except the statement that he was\nunable to stand on his own. Hence, further proceedings in the case\nbased on such unsubstantiated and vague allegations amount to an\nabuse of process of court.\n\nsteel\nDene!\nCr1.MC.5465/2020 4 2021/KER/813\nIn the result, the Crl.M.C is allowed. Further proceedings in\nC.C.No.766 of 2018 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate\nCourt-l, Kollam is quashed.\nSd/-\nV.G.ARUN, JUDGE\nvgs\nThe case number, “C.C.No.766 of 2018” occurring in the fourth\nline of the first paragraph and in the second line of the last paragraph\nof the final order dated 06/01/2021 in Crl.MC.5465 of 2020 is corrected\nand substituted as “C.C.No.767 of 2018” as per order dated\n12/07/2021 in Cri.M.A.1/2021 in Cril.M.C.5465 of 2020.\nSd/-\nDeputy Registrar\n\nepee a\nae\nWe\nCr1.MC.5465/2020 5 2021/KERBI13\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE 1 PHOTOCOPY OF F.I.R.
