To Judge\nBb\n\nasa\n2017/KER/49300\nSUNIL THOMAS, J.\n‘Crl.M.C.No.7487 of 2017.\nDated this the 06\" day of December, 2017\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner herein is the sole accused in\nS.C.No.186/2013 of Additional District and Sessions\nCourt-I, Thalassery, for offence punishable under Section\n376 of the Indian Penal Code.\n\n2. The allegation of the prosecution is that the\npetitioner herein, who got acquainted with the first\nrespondent/de facto complainant sometime in the year\n2010, offered to marry her and on the basis of the\npromise to marry, had physical relationship with her at\nvarious places. Thereafter, he retracted from the promise\nand consequently, the first respondent laid a complaint,\nalleging offence punishable under Section 376 of the\nIndian Penal Code. After investigation, final report was\n\nasa\n2017/KER/49300\n\nCrl.M.C.No.7487 of 2017 : 2:\n\nlaid and the matter is now pending as S.C.No.186/2013 of\nAdditional District and Sessions Court-I, Thalassery. The\npetitioner has approached this Court, contending that\nthey got married on 05.05.2014 under the Special\nMarriage Act and that hence, the parties do not intend to\nprosecute the matter any further. To substantiate it, the\nlearned counsel for the petitioner and the learned\ncounsel for the respondents relied on Annexure B\naffidavit affirmed by the first respondent, reiterating the\nsettlement.\n\n3. Since the allegations are serious and that it\ninvolves an offence punishable under Section 376 of the\nIPC, the learned counsel for the petitioner was directed\nto advance arguments on merits. The learned counsel for\nthe petitioner contended that, even in the complaint,\nthere is no specific allegation that the petitioner herein\nhad made a false promise. It was stated by the learned\ncounsel for the petitioner that both parties had physical\nrelationship at various hotels which militates against the\n\nasa\n2017/KER/49300\n\nCrl.M.C.No.7487 of 2017 : 3:\n\nallegation of forceful rape. It was contended that it can\nonly be considered as a physical relationship between\ntwo persons who were in deep love. ‘To substantiate it,\nthe learned counsel for the petitioner relied on the\ndecisions reported in Deelip Singh Alias Dilip Kumar\nVs. State of Bihar [(2005) 1 Supreme Court Cases\n88], Uday Vs. State of Karnataka [(2003) 4 Supreme\nCourt Cases 46] and Kaini Rajan Vs. State of Kerala\n[(2013) 9 Supreme Court Cases 113]. It was\ncontended that in the light of the above decisions, the\nvery basis that there was a false promise to marry cannot\nsurvive. It was also contended that, this is reinforced by\nthe subsequent marriage between the parties and even\nassuming that there was any false promise by the\npetitioner herein, that stands condoned by _ the\nsubsequent conduct of the parties. It was further\ncontended by the learned counsel for the petitioner that\nthe allegation of false promise cannot also survive based\non the fact that they started courting each other in the\n\n2017/KER/49300\nCrl.M.C.No.7487 of 2017 : 4:\nyear 2010. But, the first instance of physical relationship\nwas allegedly in the year 2012. This also militates\nagainst the allegation of false promise.\n\n4. Evidently, the complaint do not disclose a\nspecific allegation that at the time of the initial promise,\nthe petitioner herein had a mala fide intention. This is\nreinforced by their subsequent marriage. The learned\nPublic Prosecutor also submitted that the matter has\nbeen settled between the parties and a copy of the\nmarriage certificate was produced in open court.\n\n5. Having considered these facts, I am inclined to\nhold that prosecution under Section 376 is difficult to\nsurvive. After having entered into the matrimonial\nrelationship, it cannot be expected that the first\nrespondent herein will stand by her allegations in the FIS\nat the time of trial. Evidently, the prosecution can only be\na futile exercise. Hence, I am inclined to invoke the\njurisdiction under Section 482 of Cr.PC. to quash the\nentire proceedings.\n\nBe aa\ni ae\nasa\n2017/KER/49300\nCrl.M.C.No.7487 of 2017 : 5:\nThe Criminal Miscellaneous Case is accordingly\nallowed.\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS\nJUDGE\nBb/08/12/2017\n[True copy]\nP.A to Judge\n\n"
