CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON\n08.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nua\nCRL.M.C.NO.7456/2018 2 2021/KERMTA18\nORDER\nDated this the 8th day of January 2021\n\nThis Crl.M.C. is filed to quash the entire\nproceedings in C.C.No.1124 of 2018 on the file of\nthe Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,\nThrissur. It is a case charge sheeted by the Town\nWest Police Station, Thrissur against the\npetitioners and another alleging offences\npunishable under Sections 506(1) and 323 r/w.\nSection 34 of the Indian Penal Code. The offence\nunder Section 23 of the Juvenile Justice (Care &\nProtection of Children) Act is also alleged.\n\n2. This Crl.M.C. is filed to quash the above\nproceedings mainly on the ground that, the\nincident in this happened happened in connection\nwith a matrimonial dispute between the 1**\npetitioner and the 2™ respondent. According to\nthe counsel for the petitioners the entire\ndisputes are settled as per Annexure A3 and all\n\na\nCRL.M.C.NO.7456/2018 3 2021/KER/TA18\nthe cases are compromised based on Annexure A3\ncompromise. Now the 2™ respondent is not\nwithdrawing the present case and hence this\nCrl.M.C. is filed to quash the proceedings.\n\n3. Heard the learned counsel for the\npetitioners and the learned counsel for the 2”\nrespondent also.\n\n4. The learned counsel for the 2\" respondent\nsubmitted that, there is a counter case to\nC.C.No.1124 of 2018 in which the 2\" respondent\nand two minor children are the accused. She and\nher minor children approached this Court with an\napplication under Section 482 Cr.P.C. to quash\nthat proceedings. But as per the order dated\n16.12.2020 in Crl.M.C.No.7062 of 2015 this Court\ndismissed that application. The counsel submitted\nthat, the 2° respondent has no objection in\ngquashing the proceedings in C.C.No.1124 of 2018\nif the proceedings in the counter case is also\nquashed.\n\nua\nCRL.M.C.NO.7456/2018 4 2021/KERMTA18\n5. The main reason for dismissing\nCrl1.M.C.No.7062 of 2015 was that the prayer in\nthat petition was to quash the F.I.R. Now it is\nclear that a final report is filed in the counter\ncase also. If that is the case, the 2™ respondent\ncan file a fresh petition to quash the final\nreport in the counter case, to which the\npetitioners have no objection. Therefore,\nI think, this Crl.M.C. can be disposed of with a\nliberty to the petitioners to file a fresh\nCr1.M.C. to quash the proceedings in C.C.No.1124\nof 2018 on the file of the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate Court-II, Thrissur once the\nproceedings in Crime No.1349 of 2014 of the Town\nWest Police Station, Thrissur is quashed. The\ncounsel for the 2™ respondent submitted that, the\n2x¢ respondent has no objection in getting\nexemption to the petitioners from the lower court\nin C.C.No.1124 of 2018 if an application for\nexemption is filed by the petitioners in\n\na\nCRL.M.C.NO.7456/2018 5 2021/KERMTA18\naccordance to law.\nHence, this Crl.M.C. is disposed of with the\nfollowing directions:\n\ni) If an application is filed by the\npetitioners for exemption in C.C.No.1124 of\n2018, the Judicial First Class Magistrate\nCourt-II, Thrissur will allow the same in\naccordance to law;\n\nii) The petitioners are given liberty\nto file a fresh Crl.M.C. to quash the\nproceedings in C.C.No.1124 of 2018 on the\nfile of the Judicial First Class Magistrate\nCourt-II, Thrissur once the proceedings in\nCrime No.1349 of 2014 of the Town West\nPolice Station, Thrissur is quashed.\n\nSd/-\nP.V.KUNHIKRISHNAN\npkk JUDGE\n\nPaes Tal\nOH ae\nCRL.M.C.NO. 7456/2018 6 202UKERI1418\nAPPENDIX\n\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\n\nANNEXURE Al CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FIRST INFORMATION\nREPORT DATED 14.7.2014 IN CRIME\nNO.1336/2014 OF THRISSUR WEST POLICE\nSTATION\n\nANNEXURE A2 CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT DATED\n16.8.2014 IN CRIME NO.1336/2014 OF THRISSUR\nWEST POLICE STATION\n\nANNEXURE A3 TRUE COPY OF THE COMPROMISE PETITION IN\nO.P.
