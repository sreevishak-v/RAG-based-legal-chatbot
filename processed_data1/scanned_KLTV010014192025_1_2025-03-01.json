No.590/2025\n(Crime No. 1649/2024 of Peroorkada Police Station )\nPetitioner/Accused No.1:-\n\nJohn Prince Idicula, aged 38 years,\n\nS/o P Y Idicula, residing at Puthenvila\n\nParambil, Pidavoor PO, Pidavoor Village,\n\nPathanapuram, Kollam\n\nBy Advocate. M Sajukhan\nRESPONDENTS:-\n1. State of Kerala.\n2. Station House Officer, Peroorkada\n\nPolice Station, Thiravananthapuram.\n\nBy Public Prosecutor Dr T Geena Kumary\n\nThis Crl.M.C. came up for hearing on 28/02/2025 and the court on\n01-03-2025 passed the following :\n\nORDER\n\nThis is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik\nSuraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail.\n\n2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences\npunishable under Sections 354A(1)(i), 354A(1)(ii), 354A(1)(iv), 406 and 420,\nr/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, and Crime No. 1649/2024 of\nPeroorkada Police Station is registered against the petitioner/ 1* accused.\n\nCriminal M.C.No.590/2025 1/5\n\n3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- The accused\nNos. 1 and 2, in furtherance of their common intention to obtain wrongful gain\nand to cause wrongful loss to the defacto complainant, made her believe that\nthey will arrange her a job through JOJO Associates, as Support Care Taker in\nthe United Kingdom, and obtained a total sum of Rs.14.5 lakhs from the defacto\ncomplainant through the Bank account of JOJO Associates maintained in South\nIndian Bank, Pathanapurem Branch. Thereafter, the 2\"? accused, made phone\ncalls to the defacto complainant repeatedly, despite a clear indication of\ndisinterest by her, and showed his nudity through Whatsapp video, causing\nmental agony to her. The accused did not arrange the job as promised to the\ndefacto complainant and hence she was compelled to stay in the U.K., and also\ndid not return the money to her, thereby cheated her.\n\n4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor.\nThe Investigating Officer filed report opposing the anticipatory bail application.\n\n5. Heard. Perused the records.\n\n6. The only point to be considered is, whether an order of\nanticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioner/ 1* accused.\n\n7. The Point:- The petitioner/ 1* accused along with the 2\" accused\nis alleged to have offered job to the defacto complainant in U.K. and obtained\nmoney from her, and thereafter, neither provided the offered job nor returned\nthe money to her.\n\nCriminal M.C.No.590/2025 2/5\n\n8. The petitioner submits that, he is the owner and proprietor of JOJO\nAssociates, situated at Pathanapuram, a Company, which deal with migration\nand job visa processing, and during the year 2023, the defacto complainant\napproached his Company and submitted an application for getting a Carrier\nvisa to United Kingdom, and on depositing the requisite fees and other\nprocessing charges, she secured a visa to U.K. under the sponsorship of a\ncompany, and accordingly, she left for United Kingdom and was employed\ntherein. It is submitted that, once the defacto complainant received the visa and\nleft for U.K., the Companyâ€™s obligation towards her has been discharged, but,\nafter working in U.K. for more than one and half year, now she had filed this\nfalse complaint alleging utter falsehood. It is also submitted that, anything\nhappened in United Kingdom in connection with her employer or the company\nin which she was employed is not at all connected with the petitioner or his\ncompany, and in fact, the reason why she left U.K. is not known to the\npetitioner. The petitioner submits that, there is nothing in her statement which\nattract Sections 354A(1)(ii), 354A(1)(iii) and 354A(1)(iv) of the Indian Penal\nCode towards the petitioner.\n\n9. There is serious allegations as against the petitioner. It is seen from\nthe report that he had collected the amount from the defacto complainant.\nHowever, admittedly, he had arranged a visa and had provided a certificate of\nsponsorship and she had left for U.K. It is seen from the report that, there is no\n\nCriminal M.C.No.590/2025 3/5\n\nallegation against the petitioner pertaining to sexual harassment, and no\ncomplaint was registered by her at the time of the alleged commission of\noffence. In fact, the main allegation against the petitioner is with regard to the\nfinancial transaction and the failure of the accused persons in providing job as\noffered. Whether there is any dishonest intention on the part of the accused\npersons and whether the offered job is provided is a matter of evidence. There\nis no prima facie case as against the petitioner / 1* accused. It would be a\ntravesty of justice, if the petitioner is put behind the bars, if actually he has not\ncommitted the offence. No criminal antecedents of the petitioner is brought to\nthe notice of this court.\n\n10. In view of my discussion above, it appears that there is no\nimpediment in granting a pre-arrest bail to the petitioner. Considering all these\naspects, it is found that this is a fit case where a pre-arrest bail can be granted to\nthe petitioner.\n\nIn the result, the petition is allowed on the following conditions:-\n\n(1) In the event of arrest, the petitioner/ 1* accused shall be\nreleased on bail on his executing bond for Rs.50,000/-\n(Rupees Fifty Thousand only) with two solvent sureties for\nthe like sum each to the satisfaction of the arresting\nofficer/Investigating Officer, as the case may be.\n\n(2) Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer\nbetween 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. on every Thursday for a\n\nCriminal M.C.No.590/2025 45\n\nperiod of 3 (three) months or till the filing of the final\n\nreport, whichever is earlier.\n\n(3) Petitioner shall also appear before the Investigating Officer\nas and when required.\n\n(4) Petitioner shall not commit any offence while on bail.\n\n(5) Petitioner shall not attempt to contact the defacto\ncomplainant or any of the prosecution witnesses, directly\n\nor through any other person, or in any other way try to\n\ntamper with the evidence or influence any witnesses or\n\nother persons related to the investigation.\n\nIn case of any violation of the above conditions or misuse of\nliberty, the prosecution or the defacto complainant is at liberty to approach\njurisdictional court for cancellation of bail.\n\nDictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and pronounced by\nme in Open Court on this the 1* day of March, 2025.\nSd/-\nNAZEERA S&.\nSESSIONS JUDGE\n(Copies : 4)\nTyped by: Rifa True copy By Order\nCompared by: Manjusha\nFCS:\nSHERISTADAR\nCriminal M.C.No.590/2025 5/5\n\nCopy of Order in\nCriminal M.C.No.590/2025\nDated: 01/03/2025\nCriminal M.C.No.590/2025 6/5\n\n"
