SRI.A.P.SUBHASH\nR1 BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR SMT. RAHNA N.S\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 08.12.2017,\nTHE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\na\n2017/KER/49773\nCrl.MC.No. 7888 of 2015 2\nMARY JOSEPH, J.\n~ CrL.M.C.No.7888 of 2015\nDated this the 8\" day of December, 2017\nORDER\n\nThe final report filed by the first respondent before the\nJudicial First Class Magistrate Court, Muvattupuzha (for short the\ncourt below), in Crime No. 1575/2014 registered for the offences\nunder Section 341, 420, 427, 448 & 506(i) of the Indian Penal\nCode is sought to be quashed in this proceedings. Petitioner is the\nsole accused in the said crime. After taking cognizance of the\ncase, it was numbered as C.C.No. 1215/2015. The case was not\nproceeded with any further due to the stay of the proceedings by\nthis court.\n\n2. The allegation against the petitioner was that, he had\ncheated the defacto complainant and wrongfully restrained him\nfrom entering into a room bearing No.657/C, which has been\ntaken on rent by him from the petitioner on 14.06.2014. The\nfurther allegation was that the petitioner had destroyed the dental\nequipments kept in the room and also intimidated him by\nthreatening. Based on the allegations, the crime in question was\nregistered. The investigation was proceeded on the basis of the\ncrime so registered and after concluding the investigation, the\n\na\n2017/KER/49773\nCrl.MC.No. 7888 of 2015 3\nfinal report as Annexure A4 was laid before the court below and\nthat is sought to be quashed by this Crl.M.C.\n\n3. Sri. M.A.Abdul Hakhim, the learned counsel\nrepresenting the petitioner has submitted that, the action of the\nfirst respondent in entertaining Annexure A2 petition, registering\nAnnexure A3 FIR and submitting Annexure A4 Final Report is a\nclear abuse of the criminal judicial process. According to him, the\nallegations raised either in Annexure A2 petition or later on by the\ndefacto complainant in the statement given by him under Section\n161 CrP.C, do not constitute the ingredients of the offences under\nSection 341, 420, 427,448 & 506(i) of IPC. It is further contended\nby the learned counsel that, being an Advocate by profession, he\ncannot conduct a dental clinic as alleged in Annexure A2 petition.\nHe has also relied on Annexure AQ, the reply issued by the Payipra\nGrama Panchayath to a querry under the Right to Information Act\nthat no establishment has been functioning in the disputed room\nsince 01.09.2010 and contended on its basis that the allegations of\nthe defacto complainant would not sustain. He has also relied on\nAnnexure Al Commission Report to contend that room No. 657/C\nwas occupied by the petitioner himself and a clinic as alleged was\n\nbea\n2017/KER/49773\nCrl.MC.No. 7888 of 2015 4\nnot conducted by the defacto complainant at the relevant time\nwhen the commission of the offences was allegedly taken place.\nRaising the contentions as aforesaid, the learned counsel prayed\nfor quashing Annexure A4 Charge Sheet.\n\n4. Sri. A.P.Subash, the learned counsel representing the\ndefacto complainant has submitted on the contrary that, the\ningredients of the offences alleged by the prosecution are well\nattracted from the allegations on hand. According to him, as per\nthe allegations the defacto complainant was restrained from\nentering into the room, which was occupied by him and that is\nsufficient to attract the offence under Section 341. It is also\ncontended by the counsel that, since the allegations would disclose\nthat the petitioner had broken the lock and entered into the room\noccupied by the defacto complainant, the ingredients of the offence\nunder Section 448 would be attracted. It is also contended by the\ncounsel that an element of cheating could well be drawn from the\nallegations, since the defacto complainant is continuing occupancy\nof the room taken on rent even after the expiry of the period of\nlease. He has placed reliance on Annexure Ai to submit that in\nview of the collusive nature of the suit filed by the petitioner\n\nbea\n2017/KER/49773\n\nCrl.MC.No. 7888 of 2015 5\nagainst his brother as disclosed from Annexure Ail, the element of\ncheating would be attracted. The further contention of the learned\ncounsel was that since the dental equipments kept in the room\nhave been allegedly destroyed, the offence under Section 427 is\nalso attracted. The final contention was that since the allegation\ninclude the threat to kill against the defacto complainant there is\nnothing to doubt the sustainability of the offence under Section\n506(i) IPC.\n\n5. The learned Public Prosecutor is also heard in the\nmatter.\n\n6. In the matter of the rival contentions advanced by the\nlearned counsel representing the petitioner and the defacto\ncomplainant, it is necessary to have a glance at the allegations in\nAnnexure A2 petition, which led to the registration of the crime in\nquestion.\n\n7. Going by the contentions in Annexure A2 petition, it is\nseen that the offences alleged except the one punishable under\nSection 420 would be prima facie attracted. The allegations as\nthey stand in Annexure A2 petition are extracted herein.\n\n” Lal@l Pomed Fa (e(0)) GHP .2 10/168 GMOs\n\na\n2017/KER/49773\nCrl.MC.No. 7888 of 2015 6\nDalGOMoMalajvamem Aol e¥laiwl  Mwemoacd\nBYU Oa{SJk>O}o AQQJO 6.21C O1$)B3O0G)(M).\naGjhMGB + ANOL MVDHO\\6GBU BMJo GOHAIGMO]MIG3\n6OH0MB — TMVIAIIGDO —- PHAIWJOa|SJHOJo MAW sl\nMVM ONIN CA0allomMow] Slo BOB\nAOIONANAIGD TVAW GOON AMaial AW] agen ald\nMVIWM6sB3U MBDleflBoyoacnyo ANQJo elovserm]\nAYGROIONGISBO)0 Gen.\nMo0N@ la DNlalH0@o MOGlaéGH SlM0M 14.06.2014\nOIOMO] DO] GOMJoMAIO] HOAANOASYOOIOMo agang\nCHRO OH21MG GSHH MUAH aHMlee Maso\nUM MOSMAAIN BaUSAIOEHOHVASM)o AOQJo AYOONG McmMyo\nAQOCOMO},ADo MNBlaf[lGNAWo agar Genjowmmoo)\nS1 — QYOONG =——- HOQJMOM =OsTo M1GsHOXYHO 0\nAaAIWMO1016H}CM).\naAQOM  OOdQ1G00 988 AjOlWG3 amon\nAWOJIMOIM)o, agorg MVIWMAVALW] a8\nMAAMIAARMGIMJo SIMI MSTo MGAOA Wo amos\nQYONONG (alGAIG 21219063 aQaKM OAHIINjABO}0 a*—MJo\nANN}o ~MeGMeaine elon) AYes]Ols,ssma0e (mM).\nGHOG1MN0G3 slam GHWMIe!lo AZ] M1IGALO}ANMIJO\nAVOMM DalBaNleoxaMOlMJo BOQJo MQIO0S)eO}0M@) awl\nGOON, 191019} 88O)00e})M}.”\nOn the basis of the allegations as aforesaid that the crime was\nregistered and investigation was commenced. It is in the course of\nwhich, the statement of the defacto complainant was recorded\n\nPa El\nbasa\n2017/KER/49773\n\nCrl.MC.No. 7888 of 2015 7\nunder Section 161 CrP.C., a copy of which statement is made\navailable to the Court. While giving statement under Section 161\nCr.P.C. also the defacto complainant has not deviated from the\nallegations primarily raised by him in the First Information\nStatement. What follows therefrom was that consistency is\nmaintained in the version regarding the occurrence as alleged.\n\n8. It is relevant to have a scrutiny of the allegations to see\nwhether the commission of the offence of cheating by the\npetitioner could prima facie be derived. The pith and substance of\nthe allegations as it stands in the FIS extracted supra. Therefore,\nthis Court needs to venture to see in that backdrop whether the\ningredients constituting the offence of cheating could be drawn\ntherefrom. For that purpose, it is apposite to extract Section 415\nIPC hereunder:\n\n“Cheating.- Whoever, by deceiving any person,\nfraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so\ndeceived to deliver any property to any person, or to\nconsent that any person shall retain any property, or\nintentionally induces the person so deceived to do or omit\nto do anything which he would not do or omit if he were\nnot so deceived, and which act or omission causes or is\nlikely to cause damage or harm to that person in body,\nmine, reputation or property, is said to “cheat”.\n\n9. It is provided in the definition that in order to attract the\noffence of cheating, the act must have been done with an intention to\n\nbea\n2017/KER/49773\nCr1.MC.No. 7888 of 2015 8\ndeceive and an extraction of something based on that false promise.\n\n10. Ingredients constituting the offence are not derived from the\nset of allegations as put forth by the defacto complainant either in the\nFIS lodged to set the law in motion or in the statement recorded under\nSection 161 CrP.C., to support the allegation of cheating against the\npetitioner. Therefore, this Court is constrained to take a view that the\nallegations are insufficient to discern a view that the petitioner had\ncommitted an offence of cheating as defined under Section 415 IPC.\nTherefore, the accused is not liable to be prosecuted under Section 420\nIPC. Apart from the offence under Section 420 IPC, all other offences\nalleged against the petitioner would prima facie sustain. Therefore, the\nprosecution in respect of all offences except the one under Section 420\nIPC is liable to be maintained.\n\nIn the result, Crl.M.C stands allowed in part and Annexure A4\nfinal report, to the extent it chargesheeting the accused for the offence\nunder Section 420 IPC and further proceedings initiated pursuant to that\nstands quashed.\n\nSd/-\nMARY JOSEPH,\nJUDGE\nhmh\n\nBupa\not Perce a\nBe\n2017/KER/49773\nCrl.MC.No. 7888 of 2015 9\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE Al A PHOTOSTAT COPY OF THE COMMISSION\nREPORT IN 0.S.NO.298/2014 BEFORE THE\nMUNSIFF'S COURT MOOVATTUPUZHA\nANNEXURE A2 A PHOTOSTAT COPY OF THE PETITION\nSUBMITTED BY THE DEFACTO COMPLAINANT\nTO THE DY.S.P.MOOVATTUPUZHA\nANNEXURE A3 A CERTIFIED COPY OF FIR IN CRIME\nNO.1575/2014 OF MOOVATTUPUZHA POLICE\nSTATION\nANNEXURE A4 A CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT\nIN CC NO.1215/2015 OF THE JUDICIAL\nFIRST CLASS MAGISTRATE'S COURT,\nMUVATTUPUZHA\nANNEXURE A5 A COPY OF HTE ORDER IN\nB.A.NO.5313/2014 OF THIS HON'BLE COURT\nANNEXURE A6 A COPY OF PETITION SUBMITTED BY THE\nPETITIONER TO THE RANGE I.G.ERNAKULAM\nANNEXURE A7 A COPY OF THE NOTICE ISSUED BY THE SUB\nINSPECTOR OF POLICE, MUVATTUPUZHA\nANNEXURE A8 A COPY OF THE RELEVANT PAGE OF THE\nREGISTER MAINTAINED IN THE\nMUVATTUPUZHA POLICE STATION\nANNEXURE AQ A PHOTOSTAT COPY OF THE REPLY ISSUED\nBY PAYIPRA PANCHAYAT TO THE PETIITONER\nANNEXURE A10 TRUE COPY OF THE ELECTRICITY METER\nREADING REGISTER OF ROOM NO.657C\nMAINTAINED BY THE KERALA STATE\nELECTRICITY BOARD\nRESPONDENT'S/S EXHIBITS: NIL\n//True copy //\nPA to Judge\nhmh\n\n"
