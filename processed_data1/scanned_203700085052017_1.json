Itis alleged that, due to enmity between two factions of\na community, on 24.12.2011 at 11.30a.m, accused formed into an\nunlawful assembly, pulled out the defacto complainant from his car,\nabused him and hit him. Specific overt acts were attributed to the\naccused. Accordingly, crime was registered and after investigation,\nfinal report was filed. The matter was taken cognizance of and was\npending before the Additional District and Sessions Court,\nErnakulam as S.C.No.22 of 2014. Accused, except the petitioner\nherein, faced the trial before the court below. Learned Sessions\nJudge by Annexure-4 acquitted all the accused.\n\n3. Petitioner herein has filed this Crl.M.C on a premise\nthat, in the light of the acquittal of the remaining accused by virtue\nof Annexure-4 judgment, the substratum of the entire prosecution\ncase stands broken and no purpose will be served by prosecuting\nthe petitioner herein. It is further contended that the matter was\n\neee\n2018/KER/505\nCri.M.C.8505/17\n2\n\nsettled with the defacto complainant and the injured evidenced by\nAnnexures-5 and 6 affidavits. Learned counsel for the second and\nthird respondents acknowledged the due execution of the above\naffidavits and submitted that, they have no objection in quashing the\nproceedings. Learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted\nthat Annexure-4 was not subject to any appeal and has become\nfinal. It is also submitted that the defacto complainant has informed\norally that he has executed the affidavits. Annexure-4 judgment\nshows that, after the examination of PW1, Court found that, he did\nnot stand by the prosecution case. He only said that a group of\npeople assaulted him. He could not identify them. He categorically\ndeposed that the accused therein did not assault him. Having\nconsidered the specific version of PW1, learned Public Prosecutor\ngave up all the remaining witnesses. Consequently, accused, who\nfaced the trial, were acquitted under section 232 of Cr.P.C\n\n4. It is evident that, with this quality of evidence tendered\nbefore the trial court, a successful prosecution of the petitioner\nherein is not possible. Having considered these facts, I am inclined\nto invoke the jurisdiction under section 482 Cr.P.C to quash the\nentire criminal proceedings as against the petitioner herein.\n\neee\n2018/KER/505\nCrl.M.C.8505/17\n3\n5. It is pertinent to note that the incident happened in the\nyear 2011. Petitioner herein remained absent from the judicial\nproceedings though all other accused faced the trial. It was\nsubmitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that he was\nabroad for earning his livelihood. Having considered these facts, I\nam inclined to invoke the jurisdiction under section 482 Cr.P.C to\nquash the criminal proceedings subject to conditions.\n\nIn the result, Crl.M.C will stand allowed and all further\nproceedings in S.C.No.902 of 2016 of the Additional District and\nSessions Court, Ernakulam as against the petitioner herein will\nstand quashed on condition that the petitioner herein deposits a\nsum of Rs.2,000/- (Rupees two thousand only) within a period of 15\ndays from today with the Kerala Legal Services Authority,\nErnakulam and file proof before this Court.\n\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS\nJudge\nSbna/5/1/18\nTrue Copy / P A to Judge\n\n"
