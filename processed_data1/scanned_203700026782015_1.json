The other\nsix accused faced trial before the learned Magistrate, and\nobtained a judgment of acquittal on 29.11.2014 when all the\nmaterial witnesses including the first informant injured turned\nhostile to the prosecution in view of an amicable settlement\nmade by the parties out of court. The case against the\npetitioners was split up and refiled as C.C No.3302 of 2014.\nThey now seek orders quashing the prosecution on the ground\nof amicable settlement, and also on the ground that the very\nsubstratum of the prosecution case stands totally lost by the\nacquittal of the others, and continuance of prosecution against\nthem will not serve any purpose. In such a situation, it is quite\ndefinite that the prosecution cannot in any manner improve the\n\nDest)\n2015/KER/17603\nCri. M.C No. 2678 of 2015 2\ncase and the witnesses also cannot in any manner help the\nprosecution, if the case against the petitioners goes to trial. In\nshort, such proceeding will be a sheer waste of time.\nIn the result, this petition is allowed. The prosecution\nagainst the petitioners in C.C No.3302 of 2014 of the Judicial\nFirst Class Magistrate Court-I, Hosdurg will stand quashed\nunder Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\nAccordingly, the petitioners will stand released from\nprosecution.\nSd/-\n\nP.UBAID,\n\nJUDGE\nsab\n\n"
