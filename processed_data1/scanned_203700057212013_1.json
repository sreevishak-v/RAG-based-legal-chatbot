KAMALESWARAM S.\nMANIKANTAN NAIR\nOTHER PRESENT:\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON\n07.01.2020, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\n_\nBe\n\nCrl1.M.C.No.5721 of 2013 > 2020/KER/360\n\nORDER\nDated this the 7th day of January 2020\n\nThe petitioner is arraigned as the 374 accused in\nC.C.No.99/2012 on the file of the Chief Judicial\nMagistrate Court, Thiruvananthapuram, for having\nallegedly committed the offences punishable under\nSections 420, 464, 468, 470, 471 read with Section 34\nof I.P.C. along with two other accused. The specific\nallegation is that the accused persons had induced the\ndefacto complainant to purchase a Hyundai Accent Car\nbearing Reg.No.KL-01-AB-914, registered in the name of\nthe 3%? accused, making him believe that the vehicle has\nrun only 71,000 kms. and thereby inducing him to\ndeliver a sum of Rs.2,10,000/- as consideration. It is\nunderstood that the odometer of the vehicle was\ntampered with and that the defacto complainant was\ncheated and he filed a complaint. The specific\nallegation in the final report itself is that the\naccused 1 and 2 had introduced somebody as the 379\naccused-Vijayan Menon. The specific case of the\npetitioner is that he was abroad at that time and\n\nEnron.\n\nBe\nCrl1.M.C.No.5721 of 2013 3 2020/KER/360\ntherefore could not have participated in the alleged\nsale of the vehicle to the complainant resulting in the\nalleged cheating.\n\n2. A report was called for from the investigating\nofficer and in the first report it is very specifically\nstated by the Sub Inspector that the other accused had\nintroduced somebody as the 3*4 accused by his name, but\nhe has no specific case that the 3** accused was present\nin person for the alleged transaction. Copy of the\ndocument has also been produced by the 3*7* accused to\nindicate that he had arrived in India only after the\nalleged transaction and therefore he could not have\nbeen present for the alleged transaction. A further\nreport was called for regarding the presence of the\npetitioner/accused on the date of occurrence and\nfurther time was sought by the investigating authority\nto verify the matter with the FRRO Thiruvananthapuram\nregarding the arrival of the petitioner. But no report\nhas been filed so far.\n\n3. Final report has been filed and the matter is\npending before the Chief Judicial Magistrate,\n\nEnron.\n\nBe\nCrl1.M.C.No.5721 of 2013 4 2020/KER/360\nThiruvananthapuram. In view of the stay against the 37?\naccused, the trial has not yet been proceeded.\nConsidering the entire available materials on record,\nthere is every possibility that the petitioner was not\npresent on the alleged date of occurrence and therefore\nthe very substance of the case of the prosecution as\nagainst the 3%? accused does not have legs to stand on.\n\nI am convinced about the non-maintainability of the\ncase against the petitioner and therefore the Crl1.M.C.\nis allowed and the entire proceedings against the\npetitioner in C.C.No.99/2012 on the file of the Chief\nJudicial Magistrate Court, Thiruvananthapuram, stands\nquashed under Section 482, Cr.P.C. and the petitioner\nis discharged.\nSd/-\ndkr ASHOK MENON\nJUDGE\n\nAEDE\nBln a ve\nCrl.M.C.No.5721 of 2013 2020/KER/360\n5\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE A COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT DATED 5.5.2012\nANNEXURE B COPY OF THE RELEVANT PAGES FROM THE\nPASSPORT OF THE PETITIONER\n\n"
