The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: Due to the animosity for the\nInformant having warned the Accused not to disturb his daughter, on 17.08.2011 at\nabout 8. am, on the road side near Powdikonam Junction in Uliyazhathura Village, the\nAccused wrongfully restrained the Informant, showered obscene words on her,\npressed on her cheek using his finger and caused hurt to her by slapping on her left\ncheek. The Accused also caught hold of her saree and pulled it, outraging her modesty\ncausing mental agony to her and criminally intimidated her with threat of injury to her\nperson, to that of her husband and to commit mischief by setting her house on fire.\nThereby the Accused is alleged to have committed the above-mentioned offences.\n3. The cognizance was taken on the basis of Final Report in respect of the offences\nunder Sections 341, 294(b), 323, 354 and 506(i) of the Indian Penal Code,1860. On\nissuance of process, the Accused entered appearance. He was enlarged on bail. He was\nrepresented by a Counsel of his own choice. Copies of all relevant Prosecution records\nwere furnished to him. After hearing both parties and on perusing relevant records,\n\n3\nCharge was framed for offences under Sections 341, 294(b), 323, 354 and 506(i) of the\nIndian Penal Code,1860. It was read over and explained to him, to which he pleaded\nnot guilty and claimed to be tried.\n4. From the side of Prosecution CW1 and CW4 were examined as PW1 and PW2\nrespectively and Exhibit P1 was marked. CW6 is no more and his death certificate was\nproduced. The presence of CW2 could not be procured by the Prosecution, despite\nsteps having been issued against him. The Learned Assistant Public Prosecutor gave up\nthe remaining witnesses as the witnesses turned hostile to the Prosecution and\nProsecution evidence was closed. Since no incriminating circumstances arose against\nthe Accused from the deposition of the witnesses, his examination under Section 313 (1)\n(b) of the CrPC was dispensed with. No evidence was adduced from the side of the\nDefence.\n5. Heard both sides and perused the documents. The following points arise for\nconsideration.\n(a) Has the Accused wrongfully restrained PW1 and thereby committed\noffence punishable under Section 341 r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged?\n(b) Has the Accused uttered obscene words to PW1 and thereby committed\noffence punishable under Section 294(b) of the IPC as alleged?\n(c) Has the Accused on the same day, time and at the same place, voluntarily\ncaused hurt to PW1 and thereby committed the offence punishable under section\n323 of the IPC as alleged\n(d) Has the Accused used criminal force against PW1 intending to outrage her\nmodesty and thereby committed the offence punishable under section 354 of the\nIPC as alleged?\n\n4\n\n(e) Has the Accused criminally intimidated PW1 with threat of injury to her\n\nperson and thereby committed the offence punishable under section 506(i) of the\n\nIPC as alleged?\n\n(f) If so, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded?\n\n6. Points (a) to (e): These points are considered together for the sake of brevity and\nfor avoiding repetition.\n\nPW1 denied having statement to police to the effect that Accused assaulted her\nand uttered obscene words against PW1. She admitted her signature in Exhibit P1\nstatement. She deposed that the Accused is his neighbor and he has not assaulted her\nas alleged. She deposed that he does not intend to proceed with the case.\n\nPW2 deposed that she know both the Accused as well as PW1, but denied having\nwitnessed the incident and to have given statement to the police to that effect. effect\nthat he had witnessed the alleged incident.\n\nI have carefully considered the evidence adduced by the Prosecution and the\nmaterials on record. It is pertinent to note that PW1, the injured herself is having no\ncomplaint or allegations that the Accused have assaulted him. He deposed that he has\nno such complaints against the Accused. The remaining witnesses were given up by\nthe Prosecution as no purpose would be served in examining the remaining witness,\nwhen the Injured herself has no case supporting the Prosecution.\n\nOn perusal of the evidence led by the Prosecution and the materials on record, it\nis clear from the testimony of PWs1 and 2 that there is no evidence to support the\nProsecution case. None of the ingredients of the alleged offences are made out from the\nevidence adduced. There is nothing available on record to implicate the Accused to the\nabove incident. Hence, on a total consideration of facts and circumstances of the above\n\n5\ncase and on appreciation of the evidence adduced, this Court finds that the Prosecution\nhas failed to prove the case against the Accused persons and therefore, Points (a) to (e)\nare found in favour of the Accused persons.\n8. Point No.(f): In wake of analysis and finding on the forgoing points, this point\ndoes not arise for consideration.\n\nIn the result, Accused is found not guilty of having committed the offences\npunishable under Sections 341, 294(b), 323, 354 and 506(i) of the Indian Penal\nCode,1860.
