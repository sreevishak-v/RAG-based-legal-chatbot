CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n22.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\n2024/KER/4665\nCRL.MC_ 86/2024\n2\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J\nee ee\nORDER\nPetitioners are the accused in Crime No.589/2023 of Palode\nPolice Station, alleging offences punishable under Sections 3,\n25(IB)(a) of the Arms Act, 1959, apart from 8(1) and (2) of\nthe Abkari Act, 1967.\n\n2. While granting bail to the petitioners in Crl.M.C.982/2023,\nthe learned Sessions Judge imposed certain conditions.\nThereafter, petitioners approached this Courtâ€™ in\nCrl.M.C.No.4965/2023 seeking modification of the conditions\nimposed and by order dated 03.07.2023, this Court modified\nthe conditions and directed that petitioners obtain permission\nfrom the Jurisdictional Court, if they intent to go abroad.\n\n3. However, when petitioners approached the learned Magistrate\nseeking permission to travel abroad that petition was\ndismissed, pointing out that the Magistrate court lacked\n\nPe\nBSR aat\n2024/KER/4665\nCRL.MC 86/2024\n3\n\njurisdiction. Subsequently, petitioners once again approached\n\nthis Court through Crl.M.C.No.6057/2023 and by order dated\n\n04.08.2023, it was held that the Magistrate was not justified\n\nin dismissing the application, as the final report had not yet\n\nbeen laid.\n\n4. Pursuant to the above judgment, petitioners filed\nCrl.M.P.No.4243/23 seeking permission to travel abroad.\nHowever, by the impugned order dated 08.08.2023,\npermission was granted to go abroad only for a period of six\nmonths.\n\n5. Sri.A.Rajasimhan, the learned counsel for the petitioners,\ncontended that the order granting permission to travel abroad\nonly for six months causes serious prejudice to the petitioner\nas they had already been employed abroad even at the time\nof registration of the crime. It was submitted that\npermission ought to be granted for a minimum period of five\nyears to reside abroad.\n\n6. Sri.Noushad K.A., the learned Public Prosecutor, on the other\nhand, submitted that pursuant to the impugned order,\n\nPe\nBSR aat\n2024/KER/4665\nCRL.MC 86/2024\n4\npetitioners have already traveled abroad and that no\nprejudice would be caused to them as they can appear and\nseek extension of the period stipulated, especially since the\nfinal report is about to be filed before the Court.\n7. A perusal of the impugned order reveals that the court has\nalready granted permission to the petitioners to go abroad, as\nthey have been employed in Qatar for the last 12 years.\nConditions have been imposed that petitioners should appear\nbefore the court as and when required. Since the said\nconditions are sufficient for the time being to ensure that the\npetitioners will appear before the court, I am of the view\nthat, taking into reckoning employment of the petitioners in\nQatar, the permission for six months is too meagre and can\ncause prejudice. Considering the entire circumstances,\npermission for two years would be a reasonable period.\n8. In the above circumstances, a period of six months granted\nto the petitioners to go abroad shall stand modified to two\nyears from 08.08.2023.\n9. It is made clear that all other conditions imposed by the\n\nreo)\nEpes\napt\n2024/KER/4665\nCRL.MC 86/2024\n5\nlearned Magistrate shall continue. Any further extension of\ntime can be sought for, from the jurisdictional court in\naccordance with law.\nThe Crl.M.C.is disposed of.\nsd/-\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\nAMV/22/01/2024\n\npe ct\nBe et\n2024/KER/4665\nCRL.MC 86/2024\n6\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 86/2024\n\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES\n\nANNEXURE At TRUE COPY OF THE FIR NO. 589 OF 2023\nOF PALODE POLICE STATION\n\nANNEXURE A2 TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER IN CRLMC NO.\n982 OF 2023 OF SESSIONS COURT,\nTHIRUVANANTHAPURAM DATED 29-4-2023\n\nANNEXURE A3 TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER IN CRLMC NO.\n984 OF 2023 OF SESSIONS COURT,\nTHIRUVANANTHAPURAM DATED 29-4-2023\n\nANNEXURE A4 TRUE COPY OF THE INDIAN PASSPORT OF\nTHE 1ST PETITIONER BEARING NO.\n$1211698\n\nANNEXURE A5 TRUE COPY OF THE 1ST PETITIONER'S\nRESIDENCY PERMIT ISSUED BY THE STATE\nOF QATAR\n\nANNEXURE A6 TRUE COPY OF THE 1ST PETITIONER'S\nDIGITALLY ATTESTED ELECTRONIC LABOR\nCONTRACT DATED 29-1-2022\n\nANNEXURE A7 TRUE COPY OF THE LETTER DATED 9-5-2023\nISSUED BY THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE\n1ST PETITIONER'S COMPANY\n\nANNEXURE A8 TRUE COPY OF THE RESIDENCY PERMIT OF\n1ST PETITIONER'S WIFE NEERAJA VISHNU\nISSUED BY THE STATE OF QATAR\n\nANNEXURE AQ TRUE COPY OF THE RESIDENCY PERMIT OF\n1ST PETITIONER'S ELDER DAUGHTER\nSAHASRA VISHNU NEERAJA ISSUED BY THE\nSTATE OF QATAR\n\nANNEXURE A10 TRUE COPY OF THE RESIDENCY PERMIT OF\nTHE 1ST PETITIONER'S YOUNGER DAUGHTER\nSANIDHYA VISHNU NEERAJA ISSUED BY THE\nSTATE OF QATAR\n\nANNEXURE A114 TRUE COPY OF THE INDIAN PASSPORT OF\nTHE 2ND PETITIONER BEARING NO.\n$7249211\n\nANNEXURE A1i2 TRUE COPY OF THE 2ND' PETITIONER'S\nRESIDENCY PERMIT ISSUED BY THE STATE\nOF QATAR\n\nANNEXURE A13 TRUE COPY OF THE 2ND PETITIONER'S\nDIGITALLY ATTESTED ELECTRONIC LABOR\nCONTRACT DATED 2-4-2023\n\nANNEXURE A14 TRUE COPY OF THE LETTER DATED 9-5-2023\nTHE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE 2ND\n\nie\nBe aes oH\n2024/KER/4665\nCRL.MC 86/2024\n7\n\nPETITIONER'S COMPANY\n\nANNEXURE A15 TRUE COPY OF THE COMMON ORDER DATED\n3-7-2023 IN CRLMC NO. 4964/2023 AND\n4965/2023 OF THIS HON'BLE COURT\n\nANNEXURE A16 TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER DATED 26-7-2023\nIN CRLMP NO. 4243 OF 2023 OF THE\nJUDICIAL FIRST CLASS MAGISTRATE COURT\nFOR THE TRIAL OF FOREST OFFENCES,\nNEDUMANGAD\n\nANNEXURE A117 TRUE COPY OF THE COMMON ORDER DATED\n4-8-2023 IN CRLMC NO. 6057 OF 2023 AND\n6049 OF 2023 OF THIS HON'BLE COURT\n\nANNEXURE A118 TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER DATED 8-8-2023\nIN CRLMP NO. 4243 OF 2023 OF THE\nJUDICIAL FIRST CLASS MAGISTRATE COURT\nFOR THE TRIAL OF FOREST OFFENCES,\nNEDUMANGAD\n\nTRUE COPY\n\n"
