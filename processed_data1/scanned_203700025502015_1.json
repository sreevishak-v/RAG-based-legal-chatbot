TO JUDGE\nbp\n\nirae\n2015/KER/17578\nP. UBAID, J.\nDated this the 5\" day of May, 2015\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner seeks orders quashing the F.I.R and\nfurther proceedings in Crime No.304/2014 of the Chathannoor\nPolice Station, registered under Sections 366(A) & 376 IPC and\nSection 5j(ii)(i) of the Protection of Children from Sexual\nOffences Act, on the complaint of one Ajayakumari. Orders are\nsought on the ground of amicable settlement of the whole\ndispute between the accused and the de facto complainant out\nof court. The victim of offence (Aruna) is the 2nd respondent in\nthis proceeding brought under Section 482 of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure. It is true that the victim was a minor at the\ntime of the alleged incident. But, now she is major, and she\nhas filed affidavit to the effect that the petitioner herein has\nmarried her, and they have been leading a happy marital life.\nThe first informant, who is the 3 respondent herein has also\nfiled affidavit to the effect that she has settled the dispute\n\nwith the accused, and she has no grievance or complaint now.\n2. The learned Public Prosecutor submits, on instructions,\nthat the 2\"? respondent in fact was carrying at the time of the\n\nirae\n2015/KER/17578\nCri.M.C. No.2550 of 2015 2\nalleged incident, and that she is now happy with the petitioner\nherein as his wife. In such a situation, it will be cruel and unjust\nto proceed with the prosecution, and | find it appropriate to\nclose the prosecution.\n\nIn so many decisions, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held\nthat even in cases involving non-compoundable offences, the\nHigh Court can quash prosecution; be it at the crime stage or at\nthe trial stage, or even atthe appellate or revision stage; if the\nparties have really settled the whole dispute, or if continuance\nof prosecution will not serve any purpose. Here, | find a real\ncase of settlement between the parties, and | also find that\ncontinuance of prosecution in such a situation will not serve\nany purpose other than wasting the precious time of the court,\nwhen the case ultimately comes before the court.\n\nIn the result, this petition is allowed. The F.I.R and further\nproceedings in Crime No.304/2014 of the Chathannoor Police\nStation will stand quashed under Section 482 of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure.\n\nSd/-\nP. UBAID, JUDGE\nsd\n\n"
