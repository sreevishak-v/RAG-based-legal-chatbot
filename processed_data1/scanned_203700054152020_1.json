The de facto complainant, at\nwhose instance the crime was registered, is arrayed\nas the 2™ respondent.

Having considered the gravity of the\noffences alleged, nature of the injury caused\nand having perused the affidavit filed by the\n2™ respondent, the contents of which are\nsubmitted to be true and voluntary, I am\nsatisfied that the dispute is settled and no\npublic interest is involved in this matter.\nMoreover, in view of the _ settlement,\npossibility of the criminal proceedings ending\nin conviction is remote. As such, continuance\nof the proceedings will amount to an abuse of\nprocess of court and hence, in view of the\nlegal position set out by the Honourable\nSupreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v.\nState of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC 582] and\nGian Singh v.
