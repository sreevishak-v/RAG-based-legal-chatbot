On the apprehension of arrest, and remand to\njudicial custody, in execution of a warrant of arrest, and the\nother steps issued from the trial court, the petitioner seeks\norders under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,\ndirecting the court below to permit him to surrender, and to\nconsider his request for bail, without delay. He also seeks a\ndirection for expeditious disposal of C.C No.2485/2012. Of\ncourse a direction for expeditious disposal of the case cannot be\nnow thought of. The petitioner can very well approach the\nlearned Magistrate and make such request. His request for bail\nwill have to be considered by the learned Magistrate, who has\nissued warrant of arrest for proper and legal reasons. The\npetitioner's request for a direction to the court below to recall\nthe warrant of arrest cannot now granted because that request\n\n2015/KER/784\n\nCrl.M.C No.86 of 2015 2\n\nwill have to be considered by the learned Magistrate. The\npetitioner will have to surrender before the trial court and make\napplication for bail afresh. I do not think that the learned\nMagistrate will mechanically remand him to judicial custody\nwithout hearing him regarding his grievance and the explanation\n\nfor his absence. The learned Magistrate will have to consider\n\nhis explanation, and the question of granting him bail, on\nappropriate conditions can be thought of.\n\nIn the result, this Criminal Miscellaneous Case is\nclosed with a direction to the court below that in case application\nfor bail is filed by the petitioner, on surrender in C.C\nNo.2485/2012, the same shall be judiciously considered, and\nappropriate orders shall be passed, on the date of surrender\nitself, however with notice to the other side.\n\nP.UBAID\nJUDGE\nab\n\n"
