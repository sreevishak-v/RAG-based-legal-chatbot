CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 17-11-\n2020, THE COURT ON 07-01-2021 PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nBa\nCrl.M.C.2161/2020 ; 202 UKER/I90\nORDER\nPetitioner herein is the 7\" accused in C.C.No.3 of 2020 arising\nfrom Crime No.3/2009/SIU-1 of VACB, SIU-I, Thiruvananthapuram for\noffences punishable under section 13(1)(d) r/w 13(2) and section 120B of\nthe PC Act, 1988.\n\n2. The crux of the prosecution allegation is that, 6\" accused is\nthe owner of an old building, T.C.No.28/1830 in survey No.709 of\nVanchiyoor Village in Thiruvananthapuram district. He proposed to\nrenovate the above building. 7\" accused, who is a registered architect,\nwas entrusted with the duty of preparing the plan and for obtaining\nlicense from the authorities. Accordingly, the architect prepared a plan\nfor internal renovation of the existing building. The plan was submitted\nfor approval by 6\" accused. By order in No.TP7/BA/662/06, plan was\napproved and license was granted for carrying out internal renovation.\nProsecution alleged that, on the pretext of renovation, 6\" accused\ndemolished the entire structure and constructed a new four storied\nbuilding in its place. On getting information about the illegal\nconstruction, stop memo was issued by corporation. This resulted in\nother legal proceedings. Thereafter, 6\" accused submitted a revised plan\nand applied for regularization of the alleged deviation on the basis of the\nrenovation application prepared by 7“ accused. Prosecution alleged that\n\nBe\nCrl.M.C.2161/2020 ; 202 1U/KER/990\nthe real intention of the 6\" accused in obtaining a plan for internal\nrenovation and getting permission for that, was for demolishing the entire\nbuilding and to construct a new building in its place under that plan, fully\nknowing that, new construction was not permitted in that area. It was\nalleged that, it was done consequent to the conspiracy hatched by 6™ and\n7\" accused along with the first accused who was the Assistant Planning\nOfficer of the Corporation, 2\"! accused Town Planning Officer, 3\"¢ accused\nBuilding Inspector, 4\" accused UD Clerk and 5” accused Building\nInspector of the Town Planning Section who were public servants. It was\nalleged that, the accused, during the period 15.03.2006 to 27.11.2006\ncommitted various irregularities pursuant to the conspiracy. Further\nallegation was that, accused Nos.1 to 5 had misused their official position\nas public servants to help the 6\" accused. It was further alleged that, on\nthe application submitted for license, 7“ accused had undertaken that, he\nwill construct the building as per the approved plan and if there was any\nviolation, it would be brought to the notice of the authorities. The specific\nallegation against the 7“ accused was that the building was newly\nconstructed under his supervision. Further, even though he knew that the\nnew building was constructed in complete violation of the plan and\nlicense and that he was duty bound by the undertaking to inform the\nCorporation, he did not inform the Corporation about the above violation.\nThereafter, he even submitted an application for regularization of the\nalleged deviation, fully knowing that it was not a renovation or a mere\n\nBe\nCrl.M.C.2161/2020 , 202 1U/KER/990\ndeviation from the plan and license. On the basis of the complaint\nreceived, crime was registered and investigation was carried out.\nAnnexure-A final report was submitted before the court below.\n\n3. Contending that, 7“ accused was innocent and that, he was\nonly entrusted with the work of preparing a plan for internal renovation\nand that apart from obtaining the plan and license, he was not involved in\nthe construction work, he has approached this Court. He was neither\ninvolved in the supervision of nor in the actual work of the construction of\nthe building. Only after the completion of the construction, he got\ninvolved with the building. He being the architect, was duty bound to\nsubmit an application for regularization as instructed by the client, which\nhe did for the 6\" accused. He did it only as a part of professional\nengagement. It was further contended that, even if he was aware of the\nviolation and that, he was duty bound to inform the Corporation about the\nviolation in the light of the undertaking given by him, the breach of it can\nat the most result in a civil liability or a violation of the Code of Conduct\nfor the Architects but, not a criminal liability. It was contended that, he\nhad neither conspired with the 6\" accused nor committed any act\nindependently or in combination with the remaining accused.\n\n4. Learned Special Government Pleader for Vigilance opposing\nthe application contended that, plan submitted was prepared by the\npetitioner herein for internal renovation only. The area where the building\nwas situated was a heritage zone, where new constructions were not\n\nBe\nCrl.M.C.2161/2020 ; 202 1U/KER/990\npermitted. Fully knowing it, an application for internal renovation was\nsubmitted and under the guise of it, the building was demolished lock,\nstock and barrel and it was newly constructed. Thereafter, claiming that it\nwas only a deviation from the plan, application for regularization was also\nsubmitted. Petitioner was aware of the nature of construction and he was\nduty bound to bring it to the notice of the Corporation. It was alleged\nthat, he along with the 6\" accused clandestinely obtained the plan\napproved under the guise of renovation and made the new construction.\nThe undertaking given by him in Annexure-B to reconstruct as per the\nplan under his supervision was violated and he had conspired with the\nremaining accused.\n\n5. In the final report, 7 persons including the petitioner were\narrayed as the accused. There is no dispute that the plan was prepared\nby the petitioner herein. He had also undertaken on the plan that the\nrenovation work would be carried on under his supervision and in case of\nbreach, it will be informed to the authorities. Records available disclose\nthat the application for renewal was submitted by 6\" accused, the owner\nthrough his employees. Approved plan also shows that, it was specifically\nfor internal renovation only, keeping the main structure intact.\nInvestigation revealed that a bar hotel was functioning in that building\nand license was granted for that old building, T.C.No.37/208 and 37/208/1\nunder the name Vrindavan Tourist Home. Thereafter, a new building\nnumber 28/1830 was constructed and bar continued under the name\n\nBe\nCrl.M.C.2161/2020 ; 202 1U/KER/990\nand style Samrat Hotel. Excise records also show that the 6\" accused had\nsubmitted applications for changing the name and address of the hotel to\nHotel Samrat.\n\n6. The limited question that now arises is whether any criminal\nliability can be fastened on the petitioner herein who was a professional\narchitect and whether prosecution against him is legally sustainable. The\ntwin contentions advanced by the Special government Pleader against the\npetitioner herein was that, firstly, he was involved in the conspiracy and\nsecondly that even though he was duty bound to inform the authorities\nabout the violation, he failed to do so and had played active role in the\nconstruction of the building. It was vehemently contended by the\nlearned counsel for the petitioner that the records do not indicate that,\neither he had entered into a conspiracy with the second accused or that\nhe was involved in the construction. It was also contended that, even if\nthe petitioner had undertaken to reconstruct under his supervision and to\nensure that the renovation would be done in accordance with the\napproved plan and license, breach of it by the owner or employees of the\nowner, will not cast any criminal liability on him and he cannot be held\nanswerable for that. According to the learned counsel, at the most,\nbreach of an undertaking by itself can only result in a civil liability and a\nproceeding, if any, for breach of the Rules of Conduct applicable to\narchitects.\n\nBe\nCrl.M.C.2161/2020 , 202 1U/KER/990\n\n7. The memorandum of witnesses submitted along with the final\nreport shows that, CWs.1 and 2 are arrayed as witnesses to establish that,\nthey had submitted complaints against the new construction, alleging\nviolation of the rules. CWs. 3 to 10 were arrayed as witnesses to prove\nthe submission of application to the Corporation seeking license and\nsanction and that, pursuant to complaints regarding violation, stop memo\nwas issued by the Corporation. CWs3 to 10, 12, 13, 33 to 37, 39 to 43 and\n45 and 54 are the official witnesses of the Corporation and that of the\nExcise department, who were proposed to be examined to establish the\nalleged illegal construction and thereafter the application for\nregularization.\n\n8. Prosecution casts liability on the 7“ accused on the allegation\nthat, he had undertaken to ensure renovation in accordance with plan.\nThe specific allegation of the prosecution was that, even the plan for\nrenovation was sanctioned by the 7\" accused pursuant to a conspiracy\nwith the 6\" accused, to use the permit as a cover for construction of a\nnew building in the guise of renovation.\n\n9. The crucial question that arises is whether, materials are\navailable to show that 7“ accused was privy to the construction, apart\nfrom his admitted duty of preparing the plan. CW11 was the employee of\n6\" accused. CWs.31 and 32 were the employees of 7“ accused. CW10\nwas the Operations Manager of 6\" accused. Essentially, the prosecution\nallegation that the petitioner herein was directly involved in the\n\nBe\nCrl.M.C.2161/2020 ; 202 1U/KER/990\nconstruction of the building, has to be evaluated on the basis of the\nstatement of above witnesses.\n\n10. CW1O0, the Operations Manager of 6™ accused had stated that,\nroof tiles were removed for renovation of the building in accordance with\nthe plan and license. In the meanwhile, due to heavy rain, the building\ncollapsed. Since it could not be renovated, it was newly constructed.\n\n11. CW32 was the Supervisor of 7“ accused. It was stated by him\nthat, roof tiles of the building were removed and due to the heavy rain,\nthe structure collapsed. The versions of CW10 and CW32 show that,\ninitial work for renovation of the building were done and after the tiles\nwere removed, due to heavy rain, the building collapsed. In the light of\nthe above version of witnesses that old building collapsed due to rain, the\nallegation that the very purpose of obtaining permit for renovation was to\nnewly construct the building under the guise of renovation pursuant to\nthe conspiracy hatched between 6\" and 7\" accused along with the other\nofficials cannot survive. The version of above witnesses indicate that roof\ntiles were removed for renovation and to the unexpected fall of building,\nthe reconstruction had to be done only in such circumstances. These\nRules point out the possibility of a conspiracy to get permission for\nrenovation and under the guise of it, to construct a new building.\n\n12. It has to be considered that, even though the prosecution\nalleged that the petitioner herein conspired with other accused to obtain\nthe plan and license under the guise of renovation and that, under his\n\nBe\nCrl.M.C.2161/2020 5 202 1U/KER/990\nsupervision, a new building was constructed, there is absolutely no\nevidence to prima facie show that the 7“ accused had conspired with the\nremaining accused. The prosecution has no specific allegation as to\nwhen, where and how 7\" accused conspired with the remaining accused\nand how they hatched the plan. As mentioned above, in the light of the\nmaterials indicating that the building collapsed due to natural\nconsequences, the allegation of conspiracy, atleast involving 7\" accused,\nfor obtaining the plan and the license under the guise of renovation for\nachieving the real object of new construction and thereafter, under its\ncover, it was renovated, cannot survive.\n\n13. The next allegation of the prosecution was that, even assuming\nthat the accused was not directly involved in any conspiracy, he was\naware that the building was not renovated but was newly constructed.\nHe had an obligation to ensure that the building was renovated in\naccordance with the plan and license. By virtue of his undertaking given\nat the time of submission of plan and license, not only that he undertook\nto do that, but also to inform the Corporation authorities in case of\nbreach, to enable them to stop the violation. It is pertinent to note that, in\nthe course of reconstruction, Corporation authorities issued stop memo,\nwhich was duly accepted on behalf of 6\" accused. This is clear from the\nevidence of CW10.\n\n14. CW10 in his statement admitted that, he was not only the\nOperations Manager of 6™ accused, but his close relative also. According\n\nBa\n\nCrl.M.C.2161/2020 202 UKER/I90\n10\n\nto him, plan was prepared by the 7\" accused. After it was prepared, the\nplan was submitted to the Corporation and was got approved by CW11\nwho was the Bar Manager of 6\" accused. He also admitted that the\nbuilding was newly constructed. Construction work was done by one\nSreedharan Nair and his employees. According to CW10, he had not seen\n7\" accused or his employees supervising the work.\n\n15. CW44 who was the Senior Engineer of 7\" accused. According\nto him, the plan was prepared by 7\" accused. He asserted that, 7™\naccused had not supervised the work in the disputed building. To his\nknowledge, the work was done under the supervision of CW11. It was also\ncompleted under the direct supervision of CW11. CW32 who was the\nSupervisor of 7 accused admitted that, 7\" accused had initially asked\nhim to supervise the work in the disputed building. He went to the spot\nand supervised the work of demolishing of the building for a period of 2%\nmonths. In the meanwhile, building collapsed. Instead of renovating it,\nnew construction started under the supervision of CW1i1. This was\npromptly conveyed to 7\" accused who directed him not to get associated\nwith construction work thereafter and to keep away from supervising the\nconstruction.\n\n16. CW11 who is the Bar Manager of 6\" accused admitted that, on\nreceipt of plan from 7\" accused, he had taken it to the Corporation office,\nsubmitted it there and got the plan approved. Thereafter, the work\nstarted. However, he proceeded to add that the work was done under the\n\nBe\nCrl.M.C.2161/2020 202 1U/KER/990\n11\nsupervision of 7\" accused.\n\n17. In the light of statement given by CW10, CW44 and CW32 who\nhave unanimously stated that neither the petitioner herein nor his\nemployees supervised the new construction of work, a stray sentence of\nCW11 when analyzed in the background of his own admission that he was\ndirectly involved in the entire work, has no significance at all.\n\n18. However, the available materials atleast indicate that,\nimmediately after the building collapsed and the new construction\nstarted, petitioner herein was aware that, 6\" accused had deviated from\nthe plan and was proceeding with renovation. In the absence of any\nmaterials to show that, petitioner was actively involved in the\nconstruction of new building or that, he had conspired with the other\naccused, the above knowledge is insufficient to cast criminal liability on\nhim. The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner was that,\nthis by itself would not cast any criminal liability on the accused. There is\nno case that the petitioner misused his authority to make any wrongful\ngain. At the most, he can be found guilty of having violated the\nundertaking which may amount to professional misconduct. These are\nmaterials outside the scope of a criminal prosecution, it was submitted.\n\n19. To buttress the above contention, learned counsel for the\npetitioner relied on the decision of this Court in Thomas A.V. v. State of\nKerala and Others (2013 KHC 672). That was a case wherein\nprosecution was initiated against the office bearers of Kerala Cricket\n\nBe\n\nCrl.M.C.2161/2020 202 1U/KER/990\n12\n\nAssociation regarding the purchase of land for construction of a stadium.\nIt was alleged that, suppressing the actual price and showing higher\nprice, office bearers caused loss to the Association and thereby misused\ntheir official position. Petitioner herein, who was a lawyer was also the\nLegal Advisor of the Kerala Cricket Association. He was also arrayed as\nan accused on the ground that, he had given legal opinion on the\ngenuineness of the title deed and that, he had participated in the stadium\ncommittee meeting as a special invitee.\n\n20. Challenging his prosecution, it was contended by the advocate\nthat the legal opinion given by him was only professional advise and that\nby itself cannot cast criminal liability on him. This was accepted by the\nlearned Single Judge of this Court holding that the entire prosecution\ncase against that accused was based on the allegation that the petitioner\nwas an office bearer of the Association. In fact, he was not the office\nbearer of the Cricket Association and hence, not a public servant. There\nwas no case that the petitioner misused his capacity as a Legal Advisor\nwith a motive to commit the offence alleged against him. It was also held\nby the learned Judge that, there was no specific pleading in the complaint\nor factual imputation in the FIR regarding the ingredients of offence.\nHence, for giving legal advice alone, criminal liability cannot cast on the\nabove Legal Advisor.\n\n21. Case of the petitioner herein is slightly different from the\nabove case. In this case, petitioner had given an additional undertaking\n\nBeaee\n\nCrl.M.C.2161/2020 202 UKER/I90\n13\n\nthat, he will ensure that the building will be renovated in accordance with\nthe plan and license. Definitely, he is under an obligation to comply with\nhis undertaking. However, that by itself is not sufficient to cast any\ncriminal liability on the accused except that, he has violated the\nundertaking. Breach of it may invite civil consequence and action, if any,\nunder the Architects Act. That is a different issue. However, I am\nconvinced that the undertaking by itself and the failure in not promptly\ninforming the Corporation inspite of knowledge that the 7\" accused had\ndeviated from the plan and license cannot be a ground for a criminal\naction.\n\n22. Having considered these facts, I am satisfied that a successful\nprosecution of the petitioner on the basis of the above materials is not\npossible. Necessarily, proceedings against the petitioner alone is liable to\nbe quashed.\n\nIn the result, Crl.M.C is allowed. All further proceedings in\nC.C.No.3 of 2020 arising from Crime No.3/2009/SIU-1 of VACB, SIU-I,\nThiruvananthapuram against the petitioner will stand quashed.\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS\nSbna JUDGE\n\nass\n.
