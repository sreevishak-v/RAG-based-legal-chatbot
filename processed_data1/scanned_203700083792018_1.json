The petitioner herein is the accused in Crime No.466 of\n2018 of the Pallithottam Police Station, Kollam, registered under\nSections 341 and 323 of the IPC.\n\n3. I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the\npetitioner, the party respondents and also the learned Public\nProsecutor. It is submitted that the entire disputes between the\nparties have been amicably resolved. Reliance is placed on the\naffidavits filed by the party respondents to buttress his submission.\nIt is urged that the dispute is purely personal in nature and would\nnot affect public peace or tranquility.\n\n4. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted\nthat the statement of the de facto complainant has been recorded\nand she has stated in clear terms that she has no _ subsisting\ngrievance.\n\n2019/KER/353\nCrl.M.C.No.8379/18 3\n\n5. Ihave considered the submissions advanced.\n\n6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303]\nand in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466],\nthe Apex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the High\nCourt can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between\nthe victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal\nproceedings.\n\n7. The offence committed by the petitioner cannot be said\nto be grave and serious having ingredients of extreme mental\ndepravity. It also does not appear that the offence in this case will\nhave a serious impact on the society. It is felt that quashing of\nproceedings on account of compromise would bring about peace and\nsecure the ends of justice. Even otherwise, persisting with the\nprosecution would be nothing but a waste of time as the prospects\nof conviction is bleak. Having considered all the relevant\ncircumstances, I am of the considered view that this Court will be\nwell justified in invoking its extraordinary powers under Section 482\nof the Code to quash the proceedings.\n\nBIRR Tal\nom nite\npre\nElz ere\n2019/KER/353\nCrl.M.C.No.8379/18 4\nIn the result, this petition will stand allowed.
