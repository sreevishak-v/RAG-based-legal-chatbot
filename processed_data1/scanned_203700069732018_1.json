CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON\n11.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nCrl.MC.No.6973 OF 2018 2 202 1/KER/T767\nORDER\n\nA consignment of 24 bottles of\n\"Pankajakasthuri Breath Easy' was entrusted\nwith a courier company, the accused for\nexporting the same to America. But, the\ncustoms authorities objected its export on the\nground that it is not a commercial goods, but\nmedicinal goods which requires certain other\nlegal formalities. Hence the same was returned\nby the courier company along with the charge\nreceived in that behalf. But the crime was\nregistered on the allegation that he sustained\nheavy loss on account of its non-export. No\none can be permitted to plead ignorance\nregarding the requirements to be complied with\nwhile exporting medicinal goods. The failure on\nthe part of the complainant to comply with the\nsaid requirement cannot be placed on the\nshoulder of the accused. Further, no criminal\n\noo\nCr1.MC.No.6973 OF 2018 3 202 1/KER/T767\nliability can be extended on the accused for\nthe wrong done by the defacto complainant. The\ncrime registered on the allegation of offence\nunder Section 420 IPC is really ill-conceived\nand ill-motivated, without satisfying the\nrequirement which would constitute Section 415\nIPC. Hence, the entire crime and the further\nproceedings are quashed. Crl1.M.C. is allowed\naccordingly.\nSd/-\nP.
