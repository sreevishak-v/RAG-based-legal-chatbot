A mere perusal of the power of attorney\nwould show that it is only a special power of attorney\ngiven only for the purpose of managing the affairs of\nthe school. No right of transfer or alienation given\nunder the power of attorney. This would show what is\nbehind it. The alleged act of the accused would prima\nfacie satisfy the ingredient which would constitute the\noffence alleged. Hence, there is no ground for\nexhausting the inherent power under Section 482 Cr.P.C.\nCr1.M.C. is dismissed accordingly.\nSd/-\nP.
