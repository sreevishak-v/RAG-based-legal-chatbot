SRI.VINOD KUMAR.C\nSMT REKHA C NAIR SR PP\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n09.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nBags ial\nCr1.MC.No. 8736 of 2018 2 2011KER/1240\nORDER\n\nThis petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure (“the Code” for brevity) with a prayer to quash the\nproceedings pending against the petitioners.\n\n2. The 2™ respondent is the daughter of the 1 respondent.\nThe 1* petitioner and the 2™ respondent were in love. As their\nrelationship was not approved by the 1* respondent, they eloped. The\n1* respondent set the law in motion and based on his information,\nCrime No.661/2011 was registered on 21.07.2011. After completion\nof investigation, the final report has been laid before the Court of\nSession. The case is now pending as S.C. No.1157 of 2013 on the file\nof the II Additional Sessions Court, Thiruvananthapuram.\n\n3. Before the submission of the final report, the family\nmembers got together and decided to solemnize the marriage between\nthe lovers. Consequently, on 8.9.2012, the marriage was held as is\nevident from Annexure-C certificate. Two children were born to them\nand this fact is evident from Annexures-D and E birth certificates. The\nrespondents i and 2 have filed separate affidavits before this Court\nstating that the entire disputes have resolved between the parties and\nthey have no grievance. It is in the aforesaid backdrop that this\n\nBeer\n\nop\nCr1.MC.No. 8736 of 2018 3 2011KER/1240\npetition is filed seeking to quash the proceedings.\n\n5. Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners, the\nparty respondents and the learned Public Prosecutor.\n\n6. It is submitted that the 1% petitioner and the 2™ respondent\nhaving married, the continuance of proceedings is clear abuse of\nprocess.\n\n7. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted\nthat the statement of the party respondents have been recorded and\nthe State has no objection in terminating the proceedings as it\ninvolves no public interest.\n\n7. I have considered the submissions advanced.\n\n8. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303]\nand in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466], the\nApex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the High Court\ncan take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the\nvictim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings.\n\n9. The offence committed by the petitioners cannot be said to\nbe grave and serious having ingredients of extreme mental depravity.\n\nBes\nCr1.MC.No. 8736 of 2018 4 2011KER/1240\nIt also does not appear that the offence in this case will have a serious\nimpact on the society. It is felt that quashing of proceedings on\naccount of compromise would bring about peace and secure the ends\nof justice. Even otherwise, persisting with the prosecution would be\nnothing, but a waste of time as the prospects of conviction is bleak.\nHaving considered all the relevant circumstances, I am of the\nconsidered view that this Court will be well justified in invoking its\nextraordinary powers under Section 482 of the Code to quash the\nproceedings.\n\nIn the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-B Final\nReport and all proceedings pursuant thereto against the petitioners\nnow pending as S.C.No.1157 of 2013 on the file of the II Additional\nSessions Court, Thiruvananthapuram are quashed.\n\nSd/-\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN V\nJUDGE\nIAP\n\nlate\nices aes\nCrl.MC.No. 8736 of 2018 5 201/KER/I240\nAPPENDIX\n\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\n\nANNEXURE A TRUE COPY OF THE FIR IN CRIME NO. 661/2011\nON THE FILE OF MUSEUM POLICE STATION,\nTHT RUVANANTHAPURAM\n\nANNEXURE B CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT IN CRIME\nNO. 6611/2011 ON THE FILE OF MUSEUM POLICE\nSTATION, THIRUVANANTHAPURAM\n\nANNEXURE C TRUE COPY OF THE MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE\nISSUED FROM KACHANIT KUNNURSALA KSHETHRA\nTRUST.\n\nANNEXURE D TRUE COPY OF THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE OF\nAADIKESH S.A DATED 03-09-2014\n\nANNEXURE E TRUE COPY OF THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE OF\nADHITHYAN S.A DATED 08-06-2013\n\nANNEXURE F ORIGINAL OF THE NOTARIZED AFFIDAVIT DATED\n07-12-2018 EXECUTED BY THE 1ST RESPONDENT/\nDEFACTO COMPLAINANT\n\nANNEXURE G ORIGINAL OF THE NOTARIZED AFFIDAVIT DATED\n07-12-2018 EXECUTED BY THE 2ND RESPONDENT/\nDEFACTO COMPLAINANT\n\nRESPONDENTS ' EXHIBITS:\n\nNIL\n\n"
