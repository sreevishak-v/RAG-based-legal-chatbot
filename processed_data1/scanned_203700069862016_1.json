To Judge\nrmm\n\n2017/KER/955\nSUNIL THOMAS, J.\nDated this the 9\" day of January, 2017\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner herein is the sole accused in\nC.C.No.557/2016 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate-II, Palakkad,\nfor offence punishable under Section 27 (i) e, (iv) and (i) of Kerala\nForest Act (Amendment Act, 1993), 1961. The crux of the\nallegation of the respondent is that, the petitioner herein had\ntrespassed into the reserve forest, cleared the forest land, erected\nconcrete fence posts, and thereby caused a loss of Rs.500/- to the\nGovernment. After investigation, final report was laid, for offences\npunishable under Sections 27(i) e(iv) and (i) of the Kerala Forest\nAct, 1961. The learned counsel for the petitioner relying on\nAnnexure 2, title deed contended that the property has been\nvalidly assigned to the petitioner by the above registered\ndocuments and is in absolute possession of the property and that\nthe land is not a forest land.\n\n2. The learned Special Government Pleader for the forest,\nopposing the application, contended that the disputed property is\n\nrape\n2017/KER/955\nCrl.M.C.No. 6986 of 2016 2\na forest land. According to the counsel, the petitioner herein, had\napproached the Forest Tribunal, seeking exemption under\nSections 3(2) and 3(3) of the Kerala Private Forests (Vesting and\nAssignment) Act, 1971. The learned counsel for the petitioner\ncontented that, it was only an alternate prayer in the petition.\nEvidently, the question regarding the title, as now raised, is\nbeyond the scope of consideration under Section 482 of the Code\nof Criminal Procedure. It is essentially for the courts vested with\nthe appropriate authority, to adjudicate it and decide on the issue.\nHence, I am not inclined to invoke Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.\nThe Cri.M.C. fails and therefore, dismissed.\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS , JUDGE.\nrmm/10/1/2017\n// true copy //\nP.A to Judge\nrmm\n\n"
