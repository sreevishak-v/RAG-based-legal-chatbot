M.C No. 26 of 2015\nDated this the 6\" day of January, 2015.\nORDER\n\nThe petitioners herein are the two accused in C.C\nNo.1324/2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court - I,\nKasaragod. Crime in this case was registered under Sections 341,\n323, 324, 506(i) r/w 34 IPC on the complaint of one Vanish, S/o\nKunhanna Moolya. The petitioners now seek orders quashing the\nprosecution on the ground that they and the de facto complainant\nhave come to terms amicably out of court. The de facto\ncomplainant Vanish is the first respondent in this proceeding. He\nhas filed affidavit to the effect that he has settled the dispute with\nthe accused, and he has no grievance or complaint. I find that the\nparties have really come to terms. In such a situation, continuance\nof the prosecution will not serve any purpose, other than wasting\nthe precious time of the court, because nobody will support the\nprosecution, if the case goes to trial.\n\nIn the result, this petition is allowed. The prosecution against\nthe petitioners in C.C. No.1324/2014 of the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate Court- I, Kasaragod will stand quashed under Section\n\n-\nene mates\n2015/KER/214\nCri. M.C No. 26 of 2015 2\n482 Cr.P.C. Accordingly, the petitioners will stand released\nfrom prosecution, and the bail bond, if any, executed by them\nwill stand discharged.\nP.UBAID,\nJUDGE\nsab\n\n"
