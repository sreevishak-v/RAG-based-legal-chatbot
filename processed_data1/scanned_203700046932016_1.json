TO JUDGE\nPn\n\nS\nape\n2016/KER/33885\nSUNIL THOMAS, J.\nDated this the 3\" day of August, 2016\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner herein is the 1* accused in S.C.No.1151/2010\nof Assistant Sessions Court, Neyyattinkara arising from Crime\nNo.219/2009 of Parassala Police Station for offences punishable\nunder Sections 354, 511 of 366 and read with Section 34 of IPC.\n\n2. The allegation of the prosecution was that, the defacto\ncomplainant had complained to the teacher against the\nmisconduct of the petitioner herein. As a retaliation, two weeks\nthereafter, on 29.04.2009 at 8.10 a.m., while the defacto\ncomplainant was proceeding from the College to the house, the\npetitioner herein came in a car, driven by the 2\" accused,\nstopped near her and the 1* accused caught hold of her and tried\nto pull her inside the car. This attracted others and the accused\nwithdrew from the scene.\n\n3. On the basis of the complaint laid, crime was\nregistered. After investigation, final report was laid against both\nthe accused. The 2\" accused is absconding and is not available.\n\n4.  Cri.M.C. is laid contending that the petitioner has\ncompromised the dispute with the 1Â° respondent, the defacto\n\nS\nape\n2016/KER/33885\n\nCrl. M. C. No. 4693 of 2016 2\ncomplainant. It is stated that, the incident happened while both\nwere studying in the College and they were around 18 years at\nthat time. It was further submitted that, the parties have now\nsettled in their life and after considerable thought, the defacto\ncomplainant had decided not to pursue with the case. An affidavit\nhave been filed by the 1* respondent dated 20.07.2016. Learned\ncounsel appearing for the 2\" respondent submitted that, she has\nbeen instructed to submit that the parties have resolved their\ndisputes. The learned Public Prosecutor submitted that though\nthe allegation is serious, the petitioner herein is not involved in\nany other crime.\n\n5. Having regard to these facts, | feel that, at this length\nof time, one more opportunity can be granted to the petitioner to\nimprove his way of life. Hence, | am inclined to quash the\ncriminal proceedings.\n\nIn the result, Crl.M.C. is allowed and all further proceedings\nin S.C.No.1151/2010 of Assistant Sessions Court, Neyyattinkara\nstand quashed.\n\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE.\nPn\n\n"
