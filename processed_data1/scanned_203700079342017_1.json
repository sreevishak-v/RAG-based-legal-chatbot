The genesis of the above crime is attributed to an\nincident that happened on 27.09.2011. It was alleged that, on that\nday, at about 7 p.m., petitioner allegedly trespassed into the house\nof the de facto complainant and assaulted the de facto complainant\nand another person. Crime was registered and after investigation,\nfinal report was laid.\n\n3. Petitioner has approached this Court contending that the\ndisputes have now been amicably settled. The second respondent\nhas filed an affidavit as Annexure-A2 and the third respondent, who\nis the victim, has filed Annexure-A3 affidavit affirming the\nsettlement. It is asserted by the deponent that the complaint was\ngiven on a mistaken impression and under compelling\ncircumstances. It is further stated that the parties have now\namicably settled the subject matter of the case and that, they have\nno existing grievance against the petitioners. Hence, they sought\n\nBel\n2017/KER/49775\nCrl.M.C.7934/17\n2\nfor quashing the proceedings.\n\nA. Learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted\nthat the statement of the de facto complainant was recorded, who\nhas conveyed about the settlement. There is nothing on record to\nshow that the petitioner herein is involved in any other crime. It\nappears that the conduct of the petitioner herein has been condoned\nby the victims. Having considered the mutual settlement now\narrived at between the parties, I feel that, no purpose will be served\nby prosecuting the petitioners herein. Hence, it is a fit case in which\nthe jurisdiction under section 482 Cr.P.C can be invoked.\n\nIn the result, Crl.M.C is allowed. All further proceedings\nin S.C.No.42 of 2017 of Sessions Court, Alappuzha arising from\nCrime No.1108 of 2011 of Kayamkulam Police Station will stand\nquashed.\n\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS\nJudge\nSbna/8/12/17\nTrue Copy / P A to Judge\n\n"
