It was alleged by the defacto complainant that due to\nprevious enmity, on 31.03.2017 at 4 p.m., while she was returning\non her scooter after her employment, petitioner herein wrongfully\npushed her down and committed certain acts with the intention of\noutraging her modesty. Pursuant to the FI statement laid by her,\ncrime was registered and investigation is progressing. In the\nmeanwhile, Crl.M.C is filed by the petitioner contending that the\ndispute is a purely personal dispute and parties have resolved the\ndispute with the defacto complainant who is arrayed as the second\nrespondent.\n\n3. Learned counsel for the second respondent invited my\nattention to Annexure-A2, which is an affidavit affirmed by the\nsecond respondent reiterating the settlement. Learned Public\nProsecutor submitted that the settlement has been reported to the\npolice and the statement of the defacto complainant recorded.\n\nBe\n2018/KER/503\nCri.M.C.8498/17\n2\n\n4. Having considered the above facts and the nature of\nallegations which discloses only a personal dispute between the\nparties and also considering the fact that, there is nothing on record\nto show that the petitioner herein is involved in any other crime, I\nam inclined to invoke the jurisdiction under section 482 Cr.P.C to\nquash the criminal proceedings to meet the ends of justice.\n\nIn the result, Crl.M.C is allowed. All further proceedings\narising from Crime No.450 of 2017 of Vadanappally Police Station\nwill stand quashed.\n\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS\nJudge\nSbna/5/1/18\nTrue Copy / P A to Judge\n\n"
