The petitioner has sought for getting the\nprosecution proceedings against the petitioner quashed on\ntwo grounds. The first ground is that sanction of the Central\nGovernment, as contemplated under Section 15 of the\nPassports Act, has not been obtained and therefore, the\nprosecution proceedings shall not lie as far as the offence\nunder the Passports Act is concerned.\n\n3. AS per Section 15 of the Passports Act, no\nprosecution shall be instituted against any person in respect\n\neee\n2016/KER/33655\nCRL.M.C.No. 628 of 2015 uoe\nof any offences under the Act, without the previous sanction\nof the Central Government. When it has come out that no\nsanction was obtained, the offence under the Passports Act\nwill not lie and therefore, the same is liable to be quashed.\n\n4. With regard to the offences under the IPC, the\nlearned counsel for the petitioner has pointed out that at the\ntime of the alleged commission of the offence, the petitioner\nwas a juvenile. Hence, the petitioner can only be considered\nas a juvenile in conflict with law. Therefore, the matter has\nto be reported before the Juvenile Justice Board. The\nprosecution proceedings based on Annexure 2 final report in\nC.C.No.707/2011 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's\nCourt, Karunagappally, as far as the petitioner is concerned,\nare liable to be quashed.\n\nIn the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and the\nprosecution proceedings based on Annexure 2 final report in\nC.C.No.707/2011 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's\nCourt, Karunagappally, as far as the petitioner is concerned,\n\nPre ao)\napo\n2016/KER/33655\nCRL.M.C.No. 628 of 2015\n3:\nare hereby quashed.
