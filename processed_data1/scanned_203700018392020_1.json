The de facto complainant, at whose instance\nthe crime was registered, is arrayed as the 3‚Äù\nrespondent. Annexure-A2 affidavit has been filed by 3\nrespondent stating that the dispute, which was the\nreason for the incident and registration of the crime,\nhas been resolved amicably and he has no subsisting\ngrievance against the petitioners.\n2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also, who,\non instructions, submits that the petitioners have no\n\nBER aah\nOa\nCrl1.MC.No.1839 OF 2020 (H) AL, 2021/KERI708\ncriminal antecedents.\n\n3. Having considered the gravity of the offences\nalleged, nature of the injury caused and having\nperused the affidavit filed by the 3 respondent, the\ncontents of which are submitted to be true and\nvoluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled and\nno public interest is involved in this matter. Moreover,\nin view of the settlement, possibility of the criminal\nproceedings ending in conviction is remote. As such,\ncontinuance of the proceedings will amount to an\nabuse of process of court and hence, in view of the\nlegal position set out by the Honourable Supreme\nCourt in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab\n(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh v. State of\nPunjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is no\nimpediment in granting the relief sought.\n\nle aah\nCrl.MC.No.1839 OF 2020 (H) Be. 202 1/KERIT08\nIn the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. The\nproceedings in C.C.No.788/2014 on the files of the\nJudicial First Class Magistrate Court-III, Punalur is\nquashed.\nSd/-\nV.G.ARUN\nSB/06/01/2020 JUDGE\n\nFeat\nel\nok: 4 ie\nCrl.MC.No.1839 OF 2020 (H) 16... 2021/KER/708\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE Al THE TRUE COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT IN\nCRIME NO.846/2014 OF POLICE STATION\nOF PUNALUR, KOLLAM DISTRICT WHICH IS\nNOW PENDING AS CC NO.788/2014 ON THE\nFILES OF JFMC-III, PUNALUR.\nANNEXURE A2 THE ORIGINAL OF THE AFFIDAVIT DATED\n3.8.2019 SWORN BY THE 3RD\nRESPONDENT /DE-FACTO COMPLAINANT.\n//true copy// P.A to Judge\n\n"
