CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 26-11-2020,\nTHE COURT ON 06-01-2021 PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nsone\nCrl.M.C.7790/2019 ; 202 UKER885\nORDER\nThe sole accused in V.C.No.3 of 2019 of Vigilance and Anti-\n\nCorruption Bureau, Thiruvananthapuram unit, for offences punishable\nunder section 7(a) of Prevention of Corruption Act and sections 294(b),\n323 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code is the petitioner herein.\n\n2. The case of the prosecution is that, petitioner herein was the\nSub Inspector of Police, Chirayinkeezhu Police Station on 26.02.2019. On\nthat day, second respondent who was the Secretary of Mamam\nChenkulath Mahadeva Temple, Attingal had authorized one Gopakumar to\ncollect one load of river sand for laying in the temple premises, as a part\nof decorating the temple in connection with the festival. While the said\nGopakumar was returning in his lorry to the temple in the morning after\ncollecting river sand, he was intercepted by the petitioner herein alleging\nthat, river sand was being transported without requisite permission or\npass. The vehicle was taken to the police station and the driver was\ndetained there. On getting information, second respondent intervened\nand met the Sub Inspector. He demanded a bribe of Rs.25,000/- for\nreleasing the vehicle. On payment of money, Gopakumar was released.\nHe had also offered to permit the second respondent to take more river\nsand without any interruption, if the bribe was given.\n\n3. Alleging that the accused had committed the offences\n\nsone\nCrl.M.C.7790/2019 ; 202 UKER885\npunishable under the PC Act by demanding and receiving bribe,\ncomplaint was submitted to the ADGP Vigilance. Pursuant to it, crime was\nregistered and the investigation is progressing. Petitioner has approached\nthis Court to quash the proceedings, contending that, he has been falsely\nimplicated due to personal enmity and that, he has neither demanded\nbribe nor received it.\n\nA. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and learned\nSpecial Government Pleader. Examined the case diary.\n\n5. The alleged incident was on 26.02.2019. The version of the\npetitioner seems to be that, on 26.02.2016 in the morning, petitioner had\nintercepted the vehicle which was illicitly carrying river sand. The\nvehicle was taken to the police station. In the meanwhile, it was informed\nby the temple authorities that river sand was collected in connection with\nthe festival activities and retention of the vehicle by the accused was\nlikely to cause discord among the devotees. Apprehending that a\ncommunal angle was likely to be given, Sub Inspector released the vehicle\nforthwith. He has not demanded any bribe nor received it, it was claimed.\n\n6. Annexure-I is the copy of the complaint submitted by the\nsecond respondent to the rural police Chief. The complaint is dated\n28.02.2019. In the above complaint, he has specifically stated that, on\ngetting information that Gopakumar was detained, he went to the police\nstation and met the Sub Inspector. He demanded Rs.25,000/- for\nreleasing the vehicle and for permitting them to take more river sand.\n\nPlz\nCrl.M.C.7790/2019 , 202 UKER885\nAccordingly, the second respondent directly gave Rs.25,000/- to the Sub\nInspector. A request in writing for permitting him to take more river sand\nwas obtained by the Sub Inspector of Police.\n\n7. Pursuant to the complaint, an enquiry was conducted by the\nDySP, Attingal. The report of the DySP dated 02.03.2019 submitted to the\nDistrict Police Chief, Thiruvananthapuram rural was produced along with\nthe Crl.M.C. In that, DySP had recorded that the second respondent\nherein had reiterated the version in the complaint that, Rs.25,000/- was\ndirectly paid by him to the Sub Inspector of Police. However, the version\nof Gopakumar, was that, after interception of the vehicle, he was informed\nby the Sub Inspector that the vehicle will be released only on payment of\nRs.25,000/- to the Sub Inspector. This was conveyed to the second\nrespondent who came to the police station, got the driver released on bail\nand while they were waiting outside the police station, Gopakumar got a\ncall from an anonymous number. The person who called him informed\nhim that the call was made as directed by the Sub Inspector. Gopakumar\nwas directed to come to the railway station if the money payable to the\nSub Inspector was ready. After collecting money from the second\nrespondent, Gopakumar went to the railway station. One unidentifiable\nperson came in a car, introduced himself as the person send by the Sub\nInspector and collected money from him. He further stated that, he could\nnot recollect the number of the vehicle in which that person came. These\nversions of the second respondent and Gopakumar are seen reiterated by\n\nPlz\nCrl.M.C.7790/2019 ; 202 UKER885\nthem in their $.161 Cr.P.C statement given to the police. Evidently, the\nversions of second respondent and Gopakumar as to how the money was\ngiven are diametrically opposite. According to the second respondent, it\nwas directly paid by him to the Sub Inspector, whereas according to the\nGopakumar, he collected the money from the second respondent, went to\nthe railway station and handed it over to the unknown person.\n\n8. It is seen that, $.164 Cr.P.C statement of the said Gopakumar\nand second respondent were recorded before the learned Magistrate. At\nthe time of the statement before the Magistrate, second respondent had\nstated that, he had met the Sub Inspector of Police on the relevant day.\nOn informing him that the river sand was taken for the purpose of the\ntemple, Gopakumar was released by him. Thereafter, one person made a\ntelephone call to Gopakumar, represented himself as the person\nauthorized by the Sub Inspector and demanded money. He has further\nstated that, Gopakumar entrusted the money to that person. This is\ncontrary to his earlier $.161 Cr.P.C statement given in the complaint.\n\n9, However, Gopakumar, at the time of his statement under S.164\nCr.P.C recorded on 08.05.2019 had stated that, the vehicle which was\nintercepted by the Sub Inspector was released after the SI was informed\nthat it was meant for the temple. He asserted that, neither the Sub\nInspector had demanded the money nor has he paid any amount to the\nSub Inspector or to any other person on his behalf. Thus he completely\nretracted from the statement given under $.161 CrP.C. Hence, no\n\nsone\nCrl.M.C.7790/2019 ; 202 UKER885\ncredence can be given to the allegation of Gopakumar against the\npetitioner. Thus both the crucial witnesses have given mutually\ndestructive oral statements.\n\n10. The further version of complainant was that, on that day, for\ncollecting the river sand, he had given Rs.4500/- as value of the river sand\nand Rs.800/- towards the loading charges. A total sum of Rs.5,300/- was\npaid by Gopakumar to the persons who had sold the river sand.\nProsecution is relying on the expenditure statement of temple to establish\nthat Rs.25,000/- was paid to the petitioner as bribe. The above accounts\ninclude an entry of Rs.25,000/- paid to police for releasing the vehicle.\nHowever, expenditure statement of the temple on 26.02.2019 seized by\nthe police indicates that a sum of Rs.45,000/- was paid towards the value\nof river sand and Rs.8,000/- towards the loading expenses and the vehicle\nexpenses at Rs.17,000/-. No explanation is given by Gopakumar or 2â„¢\nrespondent as to how the huge discrepancy arose. Evidently, it seems to\nbe a highly inflated amount and hence the entries seems to be doubtful.\n\n11. The investigating agency has further alleged that the second\naccused was the person who had called Gopakumar on his mobile, while\nhe was in the police station. According to it, second accused had\ncollected the money from Gopakumar at the Railway station.\nInvestigating agency found that the telephones of second accused and\nthat of Gopakumar were within the Chirayankeezhu tower station during\nthat day. It was also found that second accused was close to Sub\n\ncoe\nCrl.M.C.7790/2019 , 202 1/KER/885\nInspector and both had called each other on the relevant day on several\noccasions. However, when second accused was shown to Gopakumar, he\ndid not identify him and stated that he was not the person who had\nreceived the money. The car in which money was handed over has also\nnot been identified.\n\n12. In the light of the specific version of the second respondent\nand the clear statement tendered by Gopakumar in his $.164 Cr.P.C\nstatement, I feel that, evidence gathered by the prosecution has become\nextremely shaky. In the absence of convincing evidence regarding the\ndemand for money and payment of it, prosecution may not be able to\nsustain the case in a court of law, notwithstanding the detailed and\nmeticulous investigation done by the agency till now. Mere suspicion\nagainst the petitioner will not be sufficient to prosecute him. Having\nconsidered it, I feel that, it may not be safe to direct the accused to face\nthe trial for the above offences in the light of this highly inconsistent\nevidence collected by the investigating officer touching the crucial\naspects. It is true that, there are some materials to suspect the conduct\nof the petitioner on other aspects than the demand and payment of\nmoney.\n\n13. Having considered the entire facts, I am inclined to quash the\nproceedings considering the quality of materials collected by the\nprosecution. However, Department will be free to initiate appropriate\ndepartmental action, if any, for releasing the vehicle without registering a\n\nBiase\npir ae\nBae\nCrl.M.C.7790/2019 202 1/KER/885\ng\ncrime.\nIn the result, Crl.M.C is allowed. All further proceedings in\nVC.No.3 of 2019 of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau,\nThiruvananthapuram unit against the petitioner will stand quashed.\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS\nSbna JUDGE\n\nDeere\ncoed\nia\n\nCr1.M.C.7790/2019 202 U/KER/885\n\n9\nAPPENDIX\n\nPETITIONER'S EXHIBITS:\n\nANNEXURE I TRUE COPY OF THE FIRST INFORMATION REPORT\nALONG WITH FIRST INFORMATION STATEMENT IN\nve NO.3/2019 OF VIGILANCE AND ANTI\nCORRUPTION BUREAU, THIRUVANANTHAPURAM UNIT.\n\nANNEXURE IT TRUE COPY OF THE REPRESENTATION SUBMITTED\nBY THE PETITIONER BEFORE DISTRICT POLICE\nCHIEF ALONG WITH THE GD ENTRY DATED 02-03-\n2019.\n\nANNEXURE ITI TRUE COPY OF THE REPLY OBTAINED UNDER RIGHT\nTO INFORMATION ACT WHICH CONTAINED THE\nENQUIRY REPORT AND STATEMENTS RECORDED BY\nTHE VIGILANCE.\n\n"
