TO JUDGE\nmbr/\n\nae\n2015/KER/17186\nK.SURENDRA MOHAN, J.\n~~ Cri.M.C.No.2479 of 2015\nDated this the 17\" day of April, 2015\nORDER\n\nThe petitioners are counter petitioners No.1 and 3 in\nM.C.No.355/2014, proceedings initiated by the Sub Divisional\nMagistrate under Section 107 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. As\nper Annexure A order, the Sub Divisional Magistrate has directed the\npetitioners to appear before the Court and to show cause why they\nshould not be directed to execute a bond for %20,000/- with two\nsolvent sureties each for the like amount for keeping peace in the\nlocality for a period of one year. The order has been passed for the\nreason that, the petitioners have been arrayed as accused in Crime\nNos.1002/2014 and 1188/2014 of Kazhakkoottam Police Station.\n\n2. According to the learned counsel for the petitioners,\nAnnexure A order is unsustainable for the reason that, the same\ndoes not disclose the substance of the information received by the\nSub Divisional Magistrate. It is contended that, it is necessary to\ndisclose the substance of such information, in accordance with the\nmandate of Section 111 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The\ncounsel also places reliance on the decisions of this Court in Henry\nVijayakumar v. State of Kerala [2009 (4) KLT 495] and Girish\nP. and Others v. State of Kerala and Another [2009 (4) KHC\n929] in support of his contention. The learned Public Prosecutor\n\nEES SHO)\nee 5 nr er\n2015/KER/17186\nCrl.M.C.No.2479 of 2015\n2\nappears for the respondent.\n\n3. Heard. A perusal of Annexure A order does not disclose the\nsubstance of the information received. The order merely says that,\nthe SHO has submitted a copy of FIR and records in Crime\nNos.1002/2014 and 1188/2014 of Kazhakkoottam Police Station and\nthat, on a perusal of the report and the records, the Sub Divisional\nMagistrate is satisfied that the petitioners are likely to indulge in\nfurther acts of criminal activities involving breach of peace. This\nCourt has in paragraph 5 of the decision reported in 2009 (4) KHC\n929, considered a similar order and has held as follows :\n\n“5. S.107 of Code of Criminal Procedure enables an\nexecutive Magistrate on receiving information that a person\n\nis likely to commit breach of peace or disturb the public\n\ntranquillity or to do any wrongful act that may probably\n\noccasion a breach of the peace or disturb the public\ntranquillity and is of opinion that there is sufficient ground\n\nfor proceeding, to require such person to show cause why he\n\nshould not be ordered to execute a bond with or without\n\nsureties for keeping peace for such period not exceeding\n\none year as the Magistrate thinks fit. S.111 mandates that\n\nwhen a Magistrate acting under S.107, deems it necessary\n\nto require any person to show cause, he shall make an order\n\nin writing setting forth the substance of the information\n\nreceived, the amount of the bond to be executed, the term\n\nfor which it is to be in force, and the number, character and\n\nclass of sureties, if any required, the necessity to setforth\n\n‘the substance of the information' in the order under S.111 is\n\nnot an empty formality and is with a purpose. It is to enable\n\nthe person against whom the order is passed, to appear and\n\nwires Sek\n2015/KER/17186\nCrl.M.C.No.2479 of 2015\n3\nshow cause before the Magistrate that the allegations are\nnot correct. Unless that information is furnished to the\nperson against whom the order is passed, he cannot defend\nthe allegation as against him.”\n4. Since the substance of the information received has not\nbeen disclosed in Annexure A order, the same is unsustainable.\nTherefore, the petitioners are entitled to succeed.\nThis Crl.M.C is accordingly allowed. Annexure A is quashed. It\nis made clear that, the Sub Divisional Magistrate shall be at liberty\nto pass fresh orders, in accordance with law, if circumstances still\nwarrant the issue of any such order.\nSd/-\nK.SURENDRA MOHAN, JUDGE.\nAV\n\n"
