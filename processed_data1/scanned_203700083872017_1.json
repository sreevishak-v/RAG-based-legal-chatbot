It was alleged by the de facto complainant,\nwho is a 14 year old girl, that the accused, who was a neighbour\nof the de facto complainant sexually abused her. It was alleged\nby her that while she had gone to the house of the accused, he\nforcefully undressed her, inserted his finger into her private parts\nand rubbed his private part against the private part of the girl.\nPursuant to an FIS laid, crime was registered. After investigation\nfinal report was filed. Cognizance was taken and the matter is\nnow pending as S.C. No.628/2017 of Additional Sessions court,\nManjeri.\n\n2. The petitioner has approached this Court contending\nthat the dispute with the de facto complainant was amicably\nsettled and that the de facto complainant has no further\ngrievance. To buttress that contention, learned counsel for the\npetitioner relied on Annexures A5 and A6 affidavits affirmed by\n\npal\n2018/KER/722\nCri. M. C. No. 8387 of 2017 2\nthe victim as well as her mother. Learned counsel for the 2\"\nrespondent, who is the victim, acknowledged the due execution of\nthe above affidavits and submitted that she has no objection in\nquashing the proceedings.\n\n3. The learned Public Prosecutor submitted that the\nstatement of the victim has been recorded and the settlement has\nbeen reported to the Police. It was also submitted that the\npetitioner is not involved in any other crime.\n\n4. Considering the serious nature of allegations raised\nagainst the petitioner, this Court was not inclined to quash the\ncriminal proceedings on the basis of an agreement between the\nparties. Hence, learned counsel for the petitioner chose to argue\nthe matter on merits.\n\n5. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, learned\nPublic Prosecutor and the learned counsel for the 2\"? respondent.\n\n6. Learned counsel for the petitioner invited my attention\nto the report of the Medico Legal Examination of the Survival of\nthe Sexual Offence dated 17.04.2017. The Doctor had physical\nexamination of the victim and found that there was no injury on\nher private parts. The hymen was intact and it was noted that no\n\npal\n2018/KER/722\n\nCri. M. C. No. 8387 of 2017 3\ninjuries were seen at present though the assault allegedly\noccurred about one month back. The records reveal that some of\nthe other witnesses who were questioned, did not refer to the\nalleged sexual abuse. In the nature of evidence gathered, the\nprosecution has to rely essentially on the oral testimony of the\nvictim. However, it seems that the victim was examined before\nthe Magistrate under Section 164 Cr.P.C. A copy of Section 164\nCr.P.C. statement has been produced by the petitioner. In the\ncourse of examination, specific question was put to the victim\nregarding the complaint against the petitioner herein. She\nfeigned ignorance. She stated that the petitioner herein was\nlooking after the family affairs of the de facto complainant. She\nfeigned ignorance regarding the complaint laid to the Police\nagainst the accused. She could not state as to who has given the\ncomplaint against the accused. A perusal of the above statement\ndiscloses that the accused has not stated anything touching upon\nthe serious allegations made in the F] statement. Evidently, in her\nSection 164 Cr.P.C. statement she has not given any incriminating\nstatement touching upon the sexual abuse.\n\n7. It is evident that, in the light of a claimed settlement,\n\nBil\n2018/KER/722\nCri. M. C. No. 8387 of 2017 4\nthe possibility of the victim supporting the prosecution case is\nexceptionally remote. The quality of evidence gathered by the\nprosecution is such that there is no chance for a successful\nprosecution of the crime. Having considered these, | feel that\ncontinuance of the proceedings is not likely to serve any fruitful\npurpose.\nHence, Cri.M.C. is allowed. All further proceedings in S.C.\nNo.628/2017 of Additional Sessions court, Manjeri stand quashed.\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE.\nPn\n\n"
