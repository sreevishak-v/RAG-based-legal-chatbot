SRI.NIRMAL V NAIR\nSRI. T. R. RENJITH PP.\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n09.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nmeg\n2019/KER/1243\nCr1.MC.No. 8772 of 2018\n2\nORDER\n\nThis petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure (‘the Code” for brevity) with a prayer to quash the\nproceedings pending against the petitioner.\n\n2. The petitioner herein is the accused in Crime No.759 of\n2018 of the Kasaragod Police Station registered under Sections 452,\n323, 324, 354, 427, 506(ii) r/w Section 34 of the IPC.\n\n3. On 31.10.2018 at about 1.35 p.m., the petitioners herein\nin furtherance of their common intention, wrongfully restrained the\nrespondents 2 and 3 and attacked them with weapons causing\ninjuries.\n\n4. I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the\npetitioners, the party respondents and the learned Public Prosecutor.\nIt is submitted that the entire disputes between the parties have\nbeen amicably resolved. Reliance is placed on the affidavits filed by\nthe 2\" and 3 respondents to buttress their submissions. It is urged\nthat the dispute is purely personal in nature and would not affect\npublic peace or tranquility.\n\n2019/KER/1243\nCr1.MC.No. 8772 of 2018\n3\n\n5. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted\nthat the statements of respondents 2 and 3 have been recorded and\nthey stated in clear terms that they have no subsisting grievance.\n\n6. I have considered the submissions advanced.\n\n7. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303]\nand in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466],\nthe Apex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the High\nCourt can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between\nthe victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal\nproceedings.\n\n8. The offence committed by the petitioners cannot be said\nto be grave and serious having ingredients of extreme mental\ndepravity. It also does not appear that the offence in this case will\nhave a serious impact on the society. It is felt that quashing of\nproceedings on account of compromise would bring about peace and\nsecure the ends of justice. Even otherwise, persisting with the\nprosecution would be nothing, but a waste of time as the prospects\nof conviction is bleak. Having considered all the relevant\n\n2019/KER/1243\nCrl1.MC.No. 8772 of 2018\n4\ncircumstances, I am of the considered view that this Court will be\nwell justified in invoking its extraordinary powers under Section 482\nof the Code to quash the proceedings.\n\nIn the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-Ai FIR\nin Crime No. 759 of 2018 of the Kasaragod Police Station and all\nproceedings pursuant thereto against the petitioners are quashed.\n\nsD/-\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN V.,\nJUDGE\navs //TRUE COPY// P.A.
