The vehicle is presently exposed to sun and\nrain. The petitioner had therefore approached\ncourt below with cCrl.MP- No.7128/2019 seeking\nrelease of the _ vehicle. The application was\ndismissed vide Annexure-Al order dated 24.12.2019\nfor the reason that the accused has not been\narrested so far, and that if the vehicle is\nreleased, there is remote chance for the accused to\nsurrender before the court or to apprehend him.\nThat apart, it was also observed that the vehicle\ncould not be traced out and seized in case of any\nviolation of condition imposed by the court and\n\n2020/KER/284\nCrl1.MC 9319/2019\n3+\n\ntherefore ordered not to release the vehicle. The\nexplanation given by the learned tItIIrd Addl.\nSessions Judge, sitting as a vacation Judge, does\nnot appear to be very reasonable because no purpose\nwould be served by letting the vehicle to _ be\ndamaged exposing it to sun and rain. It is\nsubmitted by the learned counsel appearing for the\npetitioner/accused that the accused had obtained\nanticipatory bail and he has not yet been arrested.\nThe concern of the court is only to realise the\ndamage, if any, sustained due to the use of the\nvehicle belonging to the petitioner. According to\nthe learned Senior Public Prosecutor, the\nDepartment has sustained a damage worth\nRs.60,000/-.\n\nIn view of the above, the petition to get the\nvehicle released is allowed on condition that the\npetitioner shall execute a bond for Rs.60,000/-\n(Rupees sixty thousand only) with two- solvent\nsureties each for the like amount to- the\nsatisfaction of the trial court and also on deposit\nof Rs.60,000/- CRupees sixty thousand only) in cash\n\n2020/KER/284\nCr1.MC 9319/2019\n-4-\nbefore the trial court.\nThe Criminal M.c. is allowed.\nSd/-\nASHOK MENON\n\nJUDGE\n\nIg\n\nEl os 465\naE 4 te\n2020/KER/284\nCrl.MC 9319/2019\n-5-\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE A1 TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER DATED 24/12/2019\nIN CRIMINAL M.P.NO.7128/2019 ON THE\nFILES OF THE LEARNED SESSIONS JUDGE,\nALAPPUZHA\n\n"
