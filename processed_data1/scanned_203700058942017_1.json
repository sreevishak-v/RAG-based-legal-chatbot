The first respondent herein, who is the defacto complainant\nbefore the court below, filed an application under section 91 of\nCr.P.C.for a direction to the first accused, the Managing Partner of\nthe partnership firm,to produce the partnership deed, audit report\nand an agreement dated 28/4/2016 on an allegation that the first\naccused was in possession of the above three documents. The first\naccused did not chose to file objections to the above application.\nHence, the court below by Annexure A3 order directed the first\naccused to produce the partnership deed, audit report and also the\nagreement dated 28/5/2016 within a period of three weeks from\ntoday. This is under challenge in this Crl.M.C.\n\n3. Though several arguments were advanced by the learned\ncounsel for the first accused, I am not inclined to accept those\n\naf aes\n2018/KER/709\nCrl.M.C.No.5894/2017 2\ncontentions. However, learned counsel for the first accused\ncontended that the first accused was not in possession of the above\ndocuments. If that be so, the first accused will be free to file an\naffidavit before the court below at the earliest, on or before the\nnext posting date, affirming the above fact. Thereupon, the defacto\ncomplainant will be free to let in other evidence to substantiate the\ncontentions.\nCrl.M.C.is accordingly disposed of.\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS\nJudge\ndpk\n/true copy/ PS to Judge.\n\n"
