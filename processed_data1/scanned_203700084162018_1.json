The petitioners herein are the accused in C.C.No.1377 of\n2017 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class-II, Kasaragod.\n\n3. I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the\npetitioners, the party respondent and the learned Public Prosecutor.\n\n4. It is submitted that the entire disputes between the parties\nhave been amicably resolved. Reliance is placed on the affidavit filed\nby the 2™ respondent to buttress his submission. It is urged that the\ndispute is purely personal in nature and would not affect public peace\nor tranquility.\n\n5. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted\nthat the statement of the 2\"? respondent has been recorded and she\nhas stated in clear terms that she has no subsisting grievance.\n\nElie\nCrl.MC.No. 8416 of 2018 3 201SKERIOS0\n\n6. I have considered the submissions advanced.\n\n7. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303]\nand in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466], the\nApex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the High Court\ncan take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the\nvictim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings.\n\n8. The offence committed by the petitioners cannot be said to\nbe grave and serious having ingredients of extreme mental depravity.\nIt also does not appear that the offence in this case will have a serious\nimpact on the society. It is felt that quashing of proceedings on\naccount of compromise would bring about peace and secure the ends\nof justice. Even otherwise, persisting with the prosecution would be\nnothing but a waste of time as the prospects of conviction is bleak.\nHaving considered all the relevant circumstances, I am of the\nconsidered view that this Court will be well justified in invoking its\nextraordinary powers under Section 482 of the Code to quash the\nproceedings.\n\nBeet\nops\nCrl.MC.No. 8416 of 2018 4 2019/KERIO50\nIn the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-I Final\nReport and all proceedings pursuant thereto against the petitioners in\nC.C.No. 1377/2017 on the files of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-\nII, Kasaragod are quashed.\nSD/-\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN V.,\nJUDGE\nDSVi-\n\nEarl\nois Beis a\neae\nCrl.MC.No, 8416 of 2018 5 2019/KERI650\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE I TRUE COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT IN CRIME\nNO.443/2017 DATED 7.9.2017 ON THE FILE OF\nTHE JUDICIAL FIRST CLASS MAGISTRATE COURT-\nII, KASARAGOD\nANNEXURE IT TRUE COPY OF THE AFFIDAVIT BY THE 2ND\nRESPONDENT.\nRESPONDENT'S/S EXHIBITS:\nNIL\n//TRUE CcoPpy//\nP.A.TO JUDGE\n\n"
