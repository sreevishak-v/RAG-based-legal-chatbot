No. 7650 of 2017\nDated this the 4th day of January, 2018\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner is the accused in S.T. No. 2414 of\n2015 on the files of the court below. The petitioner filed\nCMP No. 2892 of 2017 under Section 311 Cr.P.C. before\nthe court below praying for issuing summons to the eight\nwitnesses shown in the witness list. The court below, as\nper Annexure -A, did not permit the accused to\nexamine witness Nos. 2 to 4 in the witness list. Aggrieved\nby the said order, this Crl.M.C. has been filed.\n\n2. Heard both sides.\n\n3. Admittedly, witness No. 2 in the witness list is\nthe daughter of the sister of the present complainant.\nWitness No. 3 is the daughter and witness No. 4 is the\nmother of the complainant in this case.\n\nCrl.M.C. No. 7650 of 2017\n_2-\n\n4. The liability involved in this case arose out of a\ncontract in respect of the construction of the house of the\ncomplainant. The complainant contended that the\nhusband of fhe accused failed to carry on the\nconstruction work and hence, the accused had\nundertaken the liability of her husband and issued the\ncheque in question. In order to prove that the\nconstruction was already started, the petitioner wanted fo\nexamine the above said witnesses.\n\n5. The court below found that if the accused wanted\nto prove fhe construction work, he could do so by\nexamining the workers or others who were employed for\ndoing the construction work. The court below further\nrightly observed that for proving the construction work of\na house, the daughter and the mother of the owner of the\nhouse are not required. The court below further observed\nthat the intention of the petitioner was to harass the\nrelatives of the complainant. Having gone through the\nrelevant inputs, this Court is of the view that in order fo\nprove the construction of the house, the petitioner can\n\nEevee\n2018/KER/251\nCrl.M.C. No. 7650 of 2017\n_3-\nvery well examine any of his workers. In the said\ncircumstances, issuing summons to witness Nos. Z fo 4 is\ntotally unnecessary. On the facts of the case, this Court is\nof the view that the intention of the petitioner in this\nregard is only to cause harassment to the complainant.\nHaving gone through Annexure-A order, I find no reason\nto hold that the said order suffers from any illegality,\nimpropriety or incorrectness, warranting interference by\nthis Court.\nIn this result, this Crl.M.C. stands dismissed.\nB.SUDHEENDRA KUMAR, JUDGE.\nari/\n\n"
