JUSTICE BECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nTHURSDAY, THE 1874 pAY OF JANUARY 2024 / 28TH POUSHA, 1945\nCRL.MC NO. 436 OF 2024\ncc 991/2019 OF JUDICIAL MAGISTRATE OF FIRST CLASS, AMBALAPUZHA\nPETITIONER/ PETITIONER/ ACCUSED :\nRATHEESH CHANDRAN,\nAGED 44 YEARS, S/O K.P.

ASHI, PUBLIC PROSECUTOR\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n18.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nBee\nBisa\n2024/KER/4961\nCRL.MC NO. 436 OF 2024\n2\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.\n~ GrLLM.C.No.436 of 2024\nDated this the 18\" day of January, 2024\nORDER\n\nPetitioner challenges the order dated 08.12.2023 in Crl.M.P.No.4085\nof 2023 in C.C.No.991 of 2019 on the files of the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate’s Court, Ambalapuzha. According to the petitioner, an\napplication filed under Section 311 of Cr.P.C. seeking to cross-examine\nPW2 was rejected by the learned Magistrate. The reason for filing such\napplication was on account of the fact that petitioner’s counsel could not\ncross-examine the witness on the date fixed since the counsel was\nsuffering from throat pain.\n\n2. I have heard Sri.C.R.Sanish, the learned counsel for the\npetitioner as well as Sri.M.C.Ashi, the learned Public Prosecutor.\n\n3. In the impugned order, the learned Magistrate has specifically\nmentioned the various dates to which the case was adjourned for cross-\nexamination of the witness. However, on all those occasions, for some\nreason or the other, cross-examination was not carried out and on\n25.08.2023, when the witness appeared for cross-examination, the\ncounsel was not ready due to throat pain. The learned Magistrate after\nnoticing that the application for adjournment did not specify the actual\ndate on which the counsel was suffering from throat pain, refused to rely\nupon the said application and declined to recall the witness.\n\nBee\nBisa\n2024/KER/4961\nCRL.MC NO. 436 OF 2024\n3\n\n4. Ona consideration of the contentions advanced by the learned\ncounsel for the petitioner as well as the learned Public Prosecutor and on\na perusal of the impugned order, this Court is of the opinion that even\nthough the reasons given by the learned Magistrate cannot be found fault\nwith considering the circumstance that PW2 has not been cross-\nexamined, in order to enable a fair trial to be carried out, one more\nopportunity can be granted to the petitioner to cross-examine the\nwitness. The inability to cross-examine a witness due to an illness of the\ncounsel for a party cannot be a reason to recall a witness, as alternative\nmeasures ought to have been adopted by the party as well as the\ncounsel, especially since repeated postings had been given by the learned\nMagistrate in the instant case.\n\n5. However, adopting a lenient view, this Court sets aside the\nimpugned order and direct the learned Magistrate to recall PW2 in\nC.C.No.991 of 2019 on a date convenient to the court as a last\nopportunity. If on the said date so fixed by the learned Magistrate,\npetitioner fails to cross-examine the witness, necessarily further such\nopportunities need not be granted.\n\nWith the above observation, this Crl.M.C.is allowed setting aside the\nimpugned order dated 08.12.2023.\n\nSd/-\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, JUDGE\nRKM\n\nEss hl\nra EgeaA\npee\n2024/KER/4961\nCRL.MC NO. 436 OF 2024\n4\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 436/2024\nPETITIONER'S ANNEXURES :\nAnnexure Al THE CERTIFIED COPY OF ORDER DATED\n08/12/2023 IN CMP NO. 4085/2023 IN cc\nNO.991/2019\n\n"
