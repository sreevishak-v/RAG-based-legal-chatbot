No.577/2025\n(Crime No.145/2025 of Kovalam Police Station, pending before the\nJudicial First Class Magistrate Court-VII, Neyyattinkara)\nPetitioner/Accused No.3:-\n\nVishnu.B @ Vichu, aged 20 years,\n\nS/o Binu.S, Vishnu Bhavanam,\n\nKuzhivilakathu Veedu, 1045\n\nVazhamuttam, Thiruvananthapuram 695009\n\nBy Advocate:-Alif K.S\nRespondent:-\nState of Kerala represented by the Station House Officer,\nKovalam Police Station\nBy Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumary\n\nThis petition came up for hearing on 28/02/2025 and the court on 01/03/2025\npassed the following :\n\nORDER\n\nThis is an application filed by the 3 accused in the above crime under\nSection 483 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking regular bail.\n\n2. The petitioner/ 3™ accused is alleged to have committed the offences\npunishable under Sections 296(b), 115(2), 118(1), 109 and 351(3), r/w Section\n3(5) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.\n\nCriminal M.C.No.577/2025 1/6\n\n3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- On 03.02.2025 at\nabout 9 p.m., in connection with kavadi procession of Panathura Subrahmaniya\nTemple, a scuffle occurred between the defacto complainant and his friends and\nthe accused persons. Infuriated by the same, on 04.02.2025 at about 1 a.m., while\nthe friend of the defacto complainant Akhil was talking with the defacto\ncomplainant near his residence, the 1* accused beat Akhil, and when the defacto\ncomplainant attempted to obstruct the same, the 1* accused uttered obscene words,\nand by using a chopper, hacked the defacto complainant on his head and shoulder,\nand accused Nos. 2 to 4 threatened the defacto complainant and Akhil, and fisted\nand kicked them.\n\n4. Reportedly, the petitioner/ 3™ accused was arrested on 04.02.2025 and\nhe is in judicial custody since then.\n\n5. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The\nInvestigating Officer filed report opposing the bail application.\n\n6. Heard. Perused the records.\n\n7. The only point to be considered is, whether regular bail can be\ngranted to the petitioner/ 3\" accused.\n\n8. The Point:- The petitioner / 3\" accused along with the other accused\nare alleged to have abused and assaulted the defacto complainant and his friend,\n\nCriminal M.C.No.577/2025 2/6\n\nand the 1* accused has, attacked the defacto complainant, using a chopper, causing\ninjuries on his head and shoulder. The motive of the alleged incident is the\naltercation that occurred between the defacto complainant and his friends and the\naccused persons, in connection with a temple festival.\n\n9. The petitioner submits that, he is absolutely innocent of the\nallegations levelled against him and he has been falsely implicated in this case. It\nis submitted that, the 4\" accused has already been granted anticipatory bail by the\nHon’ble High Court, as per order in Bail Application No. 1854/2024, and the\npetitioner is on the same footing as that of the 4\" accused in this crime. The\npetitioner has produced the copy of the order passed by the Hon’ble High Court of\nKerala in B.A.No. 1854/2025 dated 17.02.2025.\n\n10. The magnitude of the offence alleged is grave. The main allegation is\nagainst the 1% accused. The specific overt act alleged against the petitioner/ 3\"\naccused is that, he had fisted and kicked the defacto complainant and his friend. It\nis stated in the report filed by the Investigating Officer that, the weapon and the\nvehicle used for the commission of the offence were recovered, and the wound\ncertificate is obtained. It is seen from the report that the investigation has\nprogressed much. The learned Public Prosecutor has submitted that the 2\" accused\nis yet to be arrested. However, I find no circumstance to detain the petitioner / 3\"\n\nCriminal M.C.No.577/2025 3/6\n\naccused any further for the arrest of the 2\" accused. The petitioner/ 3\" accused is\nin judicial custody for a period of 24 days. So even if the petitioner/ 3 accused is\nreleased on bail, there is nothing much, which will adversely affect the\ninvestigation. It is seen from the report that the 4\" accused in this crime was\ngranted pre-arrest bail by the Hon’ble High Court of Kerala vide order in Bail\nApplication No. 1854/2024. It appears that further detention of the petitioner/ 3™\naccused is not required for the purpose of investigation and that further detention\nof the petitioner would not meet the interest of justice. No criminal antecedents of\nthe petitioner/ 3\" accused is brought to the notice of this court. Considering the\naspects discussed afore, including the stage of investigation, I am of the view that,\nthe petitioner/ 3\" accused can be enlarged on bail subject to conditions.\n\nIn the result, the petition is allowed and the petitioner/ 3\" accused is\ngranted bail on the following conditions:-\n\n(1) Petitioner/ 3 accused shall execute bail bond for Rs.50,000/-\n\n(Rupees Fifty Thousand only) with two solvent sureties for\n\nthe like sum each to the satisfaction of the Judicial First Class\n\nMagistrate Court-VII, Neyyattinkara.\n\n(2) Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer on\n\nevery Tuesday between 10 a.m. and 12 noon for a period of 3\n\n(three) months or till the final report is filed, whichever is\n\nearlier.\n\nCriminal M.C.No.577/2025 4/6\n\n(3) Petitioner shall not commit any offence while on bail.\n(4) Petitioner shall not directly or indirectly make any\ninducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with\nthe facts of the case so as to dissuade them from disclosing\nsuch facts to the court or to any police officer or tamper with\nevidence.\n(5) Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer as and\nwhen required by the Investigating Officer.\n(6) Petitioner shall fully co-operate with the investigation.\nIn case of any violation of the above conditions or misuse of liberty, the\nprosecution or the defacto complainant is at liberty to approach jurisdictional court\nfor cancellation of bail.\n(Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and\npronounced by me in Open Court on this the 1* day of March 2025)\nSd/-\nNAZEERA.S\nSESSIONS JUDGE\n(Copies : 4) //True Copy// (By Order)\nTyped by: Soumya\nCompared bv:Rifa FCS : SHERISTADAR\nCriminal M.C.No.577/2025 5/6\n\nCopy of Order in\nCriminal M.C.No.577/2025\nDated 01/03/2025\nCriminal M.C.No.577/2025 6/6\n\n"
