Nos. 4883 & 4885 of 2016\nDated 1* August, 2016\nORDER\n\n1.The petitioner is the 1* accused in C.C.Nos. 587 of 2011\nand 1035 of 2015 of the Judicial Magistrate of 1* Class,\nThaliparamba. He is proceeded against for having\ncommitted offences punishable under Section 420 read\nwith Section 34 of the IPC.\n\n2.The prosecution allegation in these cases is that the\npetitioner was running a travel agency in the name and\nstyle as ‘Style Starlime Travels' and he offered Visa to\nrespective de facto complainants after accepting money\nfrom them. He failed to issue Visa as assured which\nresulted in the registration of crimes against him. The\npetitioner was enlarged on bail as per order dated\n23.9.2015 subject to stringent conditions.\n\n3.The petitioner is aggrieved by condition No.2 in the bail\norder which is extracted below for easy reference:\n\nrae\n2016/KER/33674\nCrl.M.C. Nos.4883 &4885 of 2016 -2-\n“2. He shall appear before the court on all\nposting dates, on the failure of which the bail\nbond shall stand automatically cancelled.”\n4.Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the\nlearned Public Prosecutor.\n5.It is submitted by the learned counsel that imposing such\nonerous condition is unconscionable. He is_ facing\nallegations in 9 cases and has been complying with the\nabove condition without fail. Insisting upon him to appear\nbefore Court on routine postings and the condition that on\nhis failure to appear even on a single day, the bail would\nstand automatically cancelled is a condition which is\nopposed to the basic tenets of a fair trial, is the\nsubmission of the learned Counsel. The petitioner is to\nritualistically appear before the learned Magistrate in all\nthe cases in which he is roped in as an accused even if no\neffective proceeding is scheduled to take place before\nCourt on that particular day. The bail order was passed a\nyear back and it is prayed that necessary orders be\npassed modifying the said condition.\n\ns016iKERI3674\nCrl.M.C. Nos.4883 &4885 of 2016 -3-\n6.The learned Public Prosecutor on instructions supported\nthe order passed by the learned Magistrate and submitted\nthat there is no need for interference at this stage.\n7.Having bestowed my anxious considerations to the rival\nsubmissions and after going through the impugned order,\nI am of the firm view that the petitioner has made out a\ncase for interference. The learned Magistrate, after having\nfound that the petitioner was entitled to bail, imposed\nadequate conditions to secure his presence before Court.\nIn view of the above the court was not justified in\nimposing a condition that even on the failure of the\npetitioner to appear before the learned Magistrate on a\nsingle posting date, his bail would be automatically\ncancelled. The petitioner is represented by a counsel all\nthrough and on postings when no effective transactions\ntake place, he can always be represented by his lawyer.\n8.Condition No 2 in Annexure 2 order will stand lifted.\nInstead it is ordered that if for some unavoidable reason,\nthe petitioner is not able to appear before the learned\n\nBIER siz\nat He\nree\n2016/KER/33674\nCrl.M.C. Nos.4883 &4885 of 2016 -4-\nMagistrate, the learned Magistrate shall not insist for his\npersonal appearance and instead the petitioner shall be\npermitted to appear through counsel, provided application\nis filed seeking exemption for the day. All other\nconditions shall remain as such. The learned Counsel\nprays that the learned Magistrate be directed to post all\nthe cases together or on alternate days. The learned\nMagistrate shall post the cases together or on alternate\ndays if it is not otherwise inconvenient for any reason.\nThe petitions are disposed off.\nSd/-\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.YV.,\nJUDGE\nkp/-1.8.16\n\n"
