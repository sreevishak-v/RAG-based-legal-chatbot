The offences alleged are punishable under\nSections 341, 323, 324, 452, 427 read with Section 34 of IPC.\n\n2. There are altogether three accused in the case. Accused\nNos.1 and 2 faced trial and were acquitted in C.C.No.1269/2009.\nA copy of the judgment dated 29.09.2012 is produced as\nAnnexure A2. The learned Magistrate found that the material\nwitnesses failed to support the prosecution case about the\ninvolvement of the accused in the occurrence. The learned\nProsecutor has justifiably given up the remaining witnesses. The\ncourt therefore found that, the prosecution failed to prove the\nguilty of the accused persons and they were found not guilty.\n\nIn the facts and circumstances, no purpose will be served by\nprosecuting the petitioner. Hence, the Crl.M.C is allowed. All\nfurther proceedings in Crime No.493/2009 of Vadanappilly Police\nStation pending as L.P.No.70/2013 in C.C.No.1117/2012 on the\nfile of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Chavakkad is quashed.\n\nSd/-\nay HARUN-UL-RASHID, JUDGE.\n\n"
