He is\naccused of having committed offence punishable under\nsections 323 and 324 of IPC. The 2™ respondent is the\nvictim.\n\n2.The instant petition is filed under Section 482 of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure banking on the ratio of the\nJudgment rendered by the Apex Court in Gian Singh v.\nState of Punjab ( 2012 (4) KLT 108) and a series of\nother cases which include Narinder Singh and others\nv. State of Punjab and anr. (2014) 6 SCC 466) and\nYogendra Yadav and others V State of Jharkhand\n(2014 (9) SCC 653 ) with a prayer to quash the above\nproceeding.\n\nBsn\n2016/KER/33662\n\nCri.M.C. No.4273 of 2016 2\n\n3.The sole ground is that the Apex Court in the above\njudgments have delineated the circumstances and the\ncases in which inherent powers under Section 482 can\nbe invoked de hors section 320 of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure for recognizing out of court settlement for the\npurpose of quashing criminal proceedings. It is prayed\nthat powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure be invoked to quash the criminal\nproceedings.\n\n4.It is submitted that the parties have reached an out of\ncourt settlement and there is no acrimony between\nthem at present. All the disputes have been amicably\nresolved and they desire to live in peace and harmony.\nThe respondent No 2 has filed an affidavit wherein he\nassert that he has no objection in terminating the\nproceedings.\n\n5.The gist of the allegation is that on 14.3.2016 at about\n11.45 p.m., the petitioner had stabbed the 24\n\nBsn\n2016/KER/33662\n\nCri.M.C. No.4273 of 2016 3\nrespondent with a knife causing injuries.\n\n6.The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submits\nthat no other cases of heinous nature are reported\nagainst the petitioner.\n\n7.1 have given my _ anxious’ consideration to the\nsubmissions made across the bar and I have also gone\nthrough the materials on record.\n\n8.The victim has sworn to an affidavit in which he asserts\nthat he has no objection in allowing the petition and in\nquashing the proceedings as all the disputes between\nthe parties have been resolved and the parties are\nliving in peace and harmony .\n\n9.It appears to me that the offence is entirely personal in\nnature and do not affect public peace or tranquility. It is\nalso felt that quashing of proceedings on account of\ncompromise would bring about peace. In a case such as\nthe instant one, even if the prosecution is allowed to\ncontinue, it would not serve any purpose as the\n\nSel\nreap naar\naa\n2016/KER/33662\nCrl.M.C. No.4273 of 2016 4\npossibility of conviction is remote and bleak. It can only\nresult in putting the de facto complainant and the\naccused to unwanted oppression and _ prejudice.\nSettlement will augur well for the interest of the\ncommunity and will enable the parties to live in peace\nand harmony.\n10.1 am of the view that this Court is well justified in\nquashing the impugned proceedings as the instant case\nfalls within the matrix of guidelines issued by the Apex\nCourt in Gian Singh ( Supra ) and the other cases\nreferred to above.\nIn the result, this petition is allowed. All further\nproceedings against the petitioner, who is the accused\nin Crime No.257 of 2016 of Aroor Police Station, are\nquashed.\nsd/-\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.Y.\nJUDGE\nps/1/8/16\n\n"
