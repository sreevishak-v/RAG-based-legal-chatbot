No.545/2025\n(Crime No. 192/2025 of Balaramapuram Police Station )\nPetitioner/Accused :-\n\nAnoop, S/o Anandakuttan, Divya Nivas,\n\nPuliyaramele, Parasuvaikkal PO, Parassuvaikkal\n\nVillage, Neyyattinkara Taluk.\n\nBy Advocates. S L Simon and Sachin L S\nRESPONDENTS:-\n1. State of Kerala.\n2. Station House Officer, Balaramapuram Police Station.\nBy Public Prosecutor Dr T Geena Kumary\n\nThis Crl.M.C. came up for hearing on 25/02/2025 and the court on\n28-02-2025 passed the following :\n\nORDER\n\nThis is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik\nSuraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail.\n\n2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences\npunishable under Sections 354 and 511 of 376 of Indian Penal Code, and Crime\nNo. 192/2025 of Balaramapuram Police Station is registered against the\npetitioner as the accused.\n\n3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- On 13.05.2019\n\nCriminal M.C.No.545/2025 1/5\n\nat about 11 a.m., in the hall room of the residence of the relative of the defacto\ncomplainant, situated at Kowdiyar, while the defacto complainant was lying in\nthe settee for sleeping, the accused caught the settee using his both hands, and\ntried to lie over her, and attempted to commit rape upon her.\n\n4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor.\nThe Investigating Officer filed report opposing the anticipatory bail application.\n\n5. Heard. Perused the records.\n\n6. The only point to be considered is, whether an order of\nanticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioner/ accused.\n\n7. The Point:- The petitioner/accused is alleged to have made an\nattempt to commit rape upon the defacto complainant.\n\n8. The petitioner submits that, the defacto complainant in this case\nis an accused in several cheating cases, involving criminal misappropriation,\nand is having active role in the death of her 24% year old daughter, which is\npending investigation before Balaramapuram Police Station as Crime No.\n154/2025, for the offence punishable u/s. 103(1) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.\nIt is submitted that, there is no explanation in her statement for the delay of\nmore than 5% years in giving statement to police. It is also submitted that, the\ndefacto complainant is the wife of the petitioner's cousin brother, and at\npresent, the defacto complainant is in inimical terms with the petitioner and his\nother relatives, and she has preferred another false complaint against her\n\nCriminal M.C.No.545/2025 2/5\n\nhusband’s cousin brother Gireeshkumar, and an F.I.R. has been registered in\nthe Balaramapuram Police Station as Crime No. 171/2025, and the same is also\npending investigation. The petitioner has produced copy of the F.I.Rs. in\nCrime Nos. 159/2025, 174/2025 and 192/2025 of Balaramapuram Police\nStation, to substantiate his contentions.\n\n9. The magnitude of the offence alleged is grave. However, it is\nseen that, the case against the petitioner is registered on the basis of the\nconfession statement given by the defacto complainant, while she was in\ncustody in another crime on allegation of commission of the murder of her\nsecond child. It is seen that the statement of the defacto complainant under\nSection 183 of BNSS is recorded in this case (Crime No. 192/2025 of\nBalaramapuram Police Station). The learned counsel for the petitioner\nvehemently argued that the defacto complainant herself being an accused in\nseveral criminal cases, her statements cannot be believed. Apparently, the\ndefacto complainant was in custody in connection with Crime No. 159/2025 of\nBalaramapuram Police Station. The petitioner’s counsel also stated that the\ndefacto complainant has also given a complaint against one Gireeshkumar\nalleging similar sexual offences. The petitioner’s counsel had produced the\ncopy of the First Information Report in Crime No. 171/2025 of Balaramapuram\nPolice Station. It is seen that the said crime was also registered, while she was\nin police custody in Crime No. 159/2025. The counsel for the petitioner also\n\nCriminal M.C.No.545/2025 3/5\n\ncontended that, the alleged attempt of rape by the petitioner occurred in the hall\nroom of the house of the relative of the defacto complainant, where other two\nrelatives are there at that time, and the story is unbelievable. The story narrated\nby the defacto complainant regarding the alleged attempt of rape is prima facie\nunbelievable. It is relevant to note here that, there was no complaint from the\npart of the defacto complainant for about five years till she was arrested in\nsome other case and her statement was taken in that case. Whether the\npetitioner is involved in the offence alleged is a matter of evidence. It would be\na travesty of justice, if the petitioner is put behind the bars, if actually no\noffence is committed by him. No criminal antecedents of the petitioner is\nbrought to the notice of this court.\n\n10. In view of my discussion above, it appears that there is no\nimpediment in granting a pre-arrest bail to the petitioner. Considering all these\naspects, it is found that this is a fit case where a pre-arrest bail can be granted to\nthe petitioner.\n\nIn the result, the petition is allowed on the following conditions:-\n(1) In the event of arrest, the petitioner/accused shall be\nreleased on bail on his executing bond for Rs.50,000/-\n(Rupees Fifty Thousand only) with two solvent sureties for\nthe like sum each to the satisfaction of the arresting\nofficer/Investigating Officer, as the case may be.\nCriminal M.C.No.545/2025 4/5\n\n(2) Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer\n\nbetween 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. on every Wednesday for a\n\nperiod of 3 (three) months or till the filing of the final\n\nreport, whichever is earlier.\n\n(3) Petitioner shall also appear before the Investigating Officer\n\nas and when required.\n\n(4) Petitioner shall not leave State of Kerala, without getting\npermission from the jurisdictional court.\n\n(5) Petitioner shall not commit any offence while on bail.\n\n(6) Petitioner shall not attempt to contact the defacto\ncomplainant or any of the prosecution witnesses, directly\n\nor through any other person, or in any other way try to\n\ntamper with the evidence or influence any witnesses or\n\nother persons related to the investigation.\n\nIn case of any violation of the above conditions or misuse of\nliberty, the prosecution or the defacto complainant is at liberty to approach\njurisdictional court for cancellation of bail.\n\nDictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and pronounced by\nme in Open Court on this the 28\" day of February, 2025.\nSd/-\nNAZEERA S.\nSESSIONS JUDGE\n\n(Copies : 4) True copy By Order\n\nTyped by: Rifa\n\nCompared by: Manjusha FCS: SHERISTADAR\n\nCriminal M.C.No.545/2025 5/5\n\nCopy of Order in\nCriminal M.C.No.545/2025\nDated: 28/02/2025\nCriminal M.C.No.545/2025 6/5\n\n"
