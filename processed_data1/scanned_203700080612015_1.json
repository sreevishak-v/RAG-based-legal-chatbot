KEMAL PASHA, J.\nre ane aye Ee\nORDER\nOn going through Annexure-A4 order passed by the\ncourt below, it seems that the court below has unnecessarily\nmade a direction that “the fact of the case pending against\nthe applicant be endorsed in the Passport”. A further\ndirection is also made by the court below to the effect that\nthe petitioner shall surrender the passport on its renewal\nwithin three days of obtaining the passport. It seems that the\ncourt has acted in a vengeance. The above said directions\nare out of place and it is not required to be made. This is not\nexpected from a court of law also. Therefore, the said\n\nee\nthee\nBear\n2016/KER/68\nCRL.M.C.No. 8061 of 2015\n“2:\ndirections contained in Annexure-A4 order are expunged.\nThis Crl.M.C is disposed of as above.\nSd/- B.KEMAL PASHA, JUDGE\nul/-\n[True copy] PS. to Judge\n\n"
