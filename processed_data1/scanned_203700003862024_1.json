M.C. ASHI (PP)\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n19.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nape\n2024/KER/4154\nCRL.MC_386/2024\n2\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J\neee i ee\nORDER\nPetitioner challenges condition No.2 in the order dated\n23.12.2023 of the Additional Sessions Court, Palakkad.\n\n2. Petitioner is involved in an offence punishable under Section\n20(b)(ii)(B) of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances\nAct, 1985 [for short, ‘NDPS Act?]. Prosecution alleged that the\npetitioner was found in illegal possession of 1.990 Kgs. of\nganja, and he was arrested on 11.10.2023.\n\n3. On 23.12.2023, the learned Session Judge granted him bail but\nimposed a condition that one of the sureties must be the parent\nor near relative of the petitioner, and further that they shall\nproduce the original title deed to prove that he or she is\nsolvent. Of course, it was specified that the original title deed\nwould be returned after verifying it with the photocopy.\n\n4. Adv.Subi.K., the learned counsel for the petitioner, submitted\n\nBlea\n2024/KER/4154\nCRL.MC 386/2024\n3\n\nthat the parents or near relatives of the petitioner are not\nsolvent, and therefore, they cannot produce the original title\ndeed to prove their solvency. It was further submitted that the\ninsistence on one of the sureties to be a parent or a near\nrelative is prejudicial and renders the order granting bail\npractically impossible to comply with. It was submitted that\ndue to the inability to comply with the said condition,\npetitioner continues to remain in jail even today, and umless\nthe said condition is deleted, the petitioner would be\nprejudiced.\n\n5. Sri.Ashi.M.C., the learned Public Prosecutor, opposed the\ndeletion of the said condition and submitted that the same is\nreasonable and even necessary, since the offence committed by\nthe petitioner is under the NDPS Act.\n\n6. Conditions in an order granting bail cannot be too onerous or\nincapable of performance. Insisting on sureties is only a means\nto ensure that the accused will appear during trial. Even if the\nsurety is not a parent or a near relative, if in case the\npetitioner absconds, proceedings can be initiated against the\n\nBlea\n2024/KER/4154\nCRL.MC 386/2024\n4\n\nsurety. In fact, the conditions imposed in the instant case do\nstipulate the petitioner to surrender his passport. Therefore,\nthe insistence on the parent or near relative being a surety for\nthe grant of bail is not a reasonable condition in the present\nscenario, especially when the petitioner contends that his\nparents and near relatives are not solvent.\n\n7. Since the petitioner asserts that his parents and near relatives\nare not solvent, the condition directing one of the sureties to\nbe his parent or a near relative, is too onerous in the peculiar\ncircumstances of the case. However, in order to ensure the\navailability of the petitioner and to ensure his presence, the\ncondition to be deleted ought to be substituted with another\ncondition that he shall file an undertaking in the form of an\naffidavit providing his mobile phone number and an\nundertaking that he will not change the said number until\nconclusion of trial.\n\n8. Therefore, condition No.2 in the order dated 23.12.2023 in\nCrl.M.P.No.6435/2023 on the files of the Additional Sessions\nCourt, Palakkad shall stand deleted and it will be substituted\n\nBER\n2024/KER/4154\nCRL.MC 386/2024\n5\nwith the following condition:\n“2, Petitioner shall file an affidavit providing his\nmobile phone number and an undertaking that the\nsaid number shall not be changed until conclusion\nof trial.”\nThe Crl.M.C.is allowed as above.\nsd/-\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\nAMV/20/01/2024\n\npS\nBy a 4\n2024/KER/4154\nCRL.MC_386/2024\n6\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 386/2024\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES\nANNEXURE- 1 TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER DTD. 23/12/2023\nIN CRL.M.P.NO.6435 OF 2023 IN\n$.C.NO.1161 OF 2023 IN CRIME NO.63 OF\n2023 OF EXCISE ENFORCEMENT AND ANTI\nNARCOTIC SPECIAL SQUAD, PALAKKAD ON THE\nFILES OF ADDITIONAL SESSIONS JUDGE-II,\nPALAKKAD DISTRICT.\nTRUE COPY\n\n"
