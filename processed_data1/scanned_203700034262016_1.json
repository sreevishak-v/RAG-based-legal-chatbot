TO JUDGE\nSTK\n\nBel\npsa\n2018/KER/241\nB. SUDHEENDRA KUMAR, J.\nCri.M.C. No.3426 of 2016\nDated this the 4\" day of January, 2018\nORDER\n\nThe petitioners are accused Nos.1 and 2 in\nC.C.No.120/2016 on the files of the court below. The\nabove case arose out of a private complaint filed by the\nsecond respondent herein before the court below alleging\nthe offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable\nInstruments Act (in short, 'the N.I.Act').\n\n2. The petitioners have filed this Crl.M.C., praying\nfor quashing Annexure-Al complaint and _ further\nproceedings against the petitioner in the above said case.\n\n3. Heard.\n\n4, The learned counsel for the petitioners has\nsubmitted that the petitioners are not the present\nPresident and Secretary of V.B. Garden Flat Owners\nAssociation and hence, the complaint filed against the\npetitioners is not maintainable.\n\n5. It is clearly stated in Annexure-Al complaint\n\nBel\nap\n2018/KER/241\nCri.M.C. No.3426 of 2016\n“i 2t\nthat the liability, which resulted in issuing the cheque in\nquestion, arose out of the supply of the drinking water to\nthe flat, namely, 'M/s.V.B.Garden'. The water was\nsupplied as per the request of V.B.Garden Flat Owners\nAssociation.\n\n6. The provision contained in Section 141 of the\nNegotiable Instruments Act clearly stipulates that when a\ncompany commits an offence, then certain categories of\npersons in-charge as well as the company would be\ndeemed to be liable for the offence under Section 138 of\nthe N.I.Act. Thus, the statutory intendment is absolutely\nplain. As is perceptible, the provision makes the\nfunctionaries and companies to be liable and that is by\ndeeming fiction. Therefore, if the company commits an\noffence, the company has to be made as an accused. In\nexplanation to Section 141 of the N.I. Act, “company”\nmeans any body corporate and includes a firm or other\nassociation of individuals. Therefore, without the\nassociation being made as an accused, the complaint\n\nBel\npsa\n2018/KER/241\nCri.M.C. No.3426 of 2016\n“i3G-\ncannot be maintainable.\n\n7. The 1* and the 2™ accused are the present\nPresident and the Secretary of V.B.Garden Flat Owners\nAssociation, who represent the association. Therefore,\nthe petitioners are not arraigned as accused in their\npersonal capacity. It is also contended in the complaint\nthat the 3% and the 4\" accused were the former President\nand Secretary of V.B.Garden Flat Owners Association,\nwho executed and issued the cheque in question as they\nwere then in-charge and responsible for the affairs of the\nAssociation. It is further alleged that the 1% and the 2\"\naccused are presently in-charge and responsible for the\nday-to-day affairs of the Association. It is stated that the\n3 and the 4\" accused, in their capacity as the then\nPresident and Secretary of the Association, issued the\ncheque in question. In view of the above averments, | am\nof the view that the complaint filed is perfectly\nmaintainable. However, whether the petitioners are the\npresent President and the Secretary of the Association or\n\nBaal\na eattate\nirene)\n2018/KER/241\nCri.M.C. No.3426 of 2016\n-: 4;-\nnot, can be decided only after taking evidence. Suffice it\nto say that, having gone through the averments in\nAnnexure-Al complaint, | am_ satisfied that Ext.Al\ncomplaint prima facie discloses the ingredients to\nconstitute the offence under Section 138 of the N.|.Act. In\nthe said circumstances, | am not inclined to quash\nAnnexure-Al complaint and further proceedings against\nthe petitioners as sought for.\nIn the result, this Crl.M.C. stands dismissed.\nHowever, the petitioners shall be granted exemption\nfrom personal appearance before the court below on all\nposting dates except when their presence is necessary for\nthe progress of the case, if the petitioners file application\nin this regard before the court below, after their\nappearance in person before the court, within 30 days\nfrom today.
