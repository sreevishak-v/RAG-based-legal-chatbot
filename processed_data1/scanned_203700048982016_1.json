A. TO JUDGE\nPn\n\n2016/KER/33889\nSUNIL THOMAS, J.\nDated this the 3\" day of August, 2016\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner herein challenges the order of the court below\nin CMP No.2404/2016 in MC (DV) No.167/2011. The petitioner\nherein had filed the MC seeking reliefs in the year 2011.\nThereafter, it appears that, there was a direction for a time bound\ndisposal of that case. The court was proceeding with the case to\nbe disposed of on or before 14.06.2016, as per the order in MC\nNo.793/2015 dated 09.02.2015 of the Hon'ble High Court. At that\ntime, the petitioner herein filed the amendment application.\nHence, the learned Magistrate addressed the High Court to seek\nextension of time. Even the court below has noted that, several\npetitions were filed by the petitioner one after another and hence\ncourt could not dispose of the case within the time stipulated.\nThe court below holding that the application was highly belated,\nallowed the application subject to payment of cost of 71,000/- to\nbe paid within 3 days. This is under challenge in this petition.\n\n2. Heard the petitioner in person at length and the\nlearned Public Prosecutor.\n\n3. |The impugned order speaks by itself. Even though the\n\n2016/KER/33889\n\nCrl. M. C. No. 4898 of 2016 2\n\ncase was initiated by the party in person in the year 2011, it could\nnot be brought to the logical conclusion, due to various reasons.\nEven the court below has taken note of the fact that the petitions\nwere being filed one after another, considerably delaying the\nentire procedure. The petitioner herein cannot now lament of\ndelay after being a party for such delay. On enquiry from the\nparty-in-person itself, it is revealed that, at least six proceedings\nare pending arising out of matrimonial discord in various courts\nincluding two before this Court.\n\n4. The only ground on which the impugned order is\nchallenged is that, she is without any means, she has no\nemployment and that she has no other source of income. Prima\nfacie, the fact that she herself has been contesting the\nproceedings in various courts and she herself claims to be a B.Sc\nB.Ed graduate, belies her contention.\n\n5. Having regard to the entire facts and in the interest of\njustice, | am inclined to take a lenient view and to delete the\nportion imposing cost only to ensure that the matter is not further\ndelayed under the guise of pendency of this Crl.M.C.\n\n6. Hence, Crl.M.C. is disposed of confirming the impugned\n\nPe\n\na A\n\neee\n\n2016/KER/33889\nCri. M. C. No. 4898 of 2016 3\norder however, by directing that the cost as ordered by the court\nthough legally correct, need not be insisted upon. It is made clear\nthat, the petitioner herein shall carry out the amendment in the\npresence of the Junior Superintendent of that Court within 5 days\nfrom today. If this order is not complied with, within 5 days from\ntoday, the benefit of amendment will not be available to the\npetitioner herein. Issue copy forthwith to the petitioner. She shall\nproduce it before the court below within the above 5 days.\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE.\n\nPn\n\n"
