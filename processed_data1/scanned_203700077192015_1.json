TO JUDGE\nrs.\n\npete\n2016/KER/59\nB.

As the petitioner was not in place, the case\nagainst him was split up and it is presently pending as\nL.PC.No.3 of 2009 before the above court. The case\nagainst the other accused was numbered as\nS.C.No.355/2008 before the Additional Sessions Court,\nKasaragod. The case was_- proceeded with in\n\npete\n\n2016/KER/59\nCRL.M.C.No. 7719 of 2015 ue\nS.C.No.355/2008, which has culminated in the acquittal of\nthe other accused, through Annexure A2 judgment. On\ngoing through Annexure A2 judgment, it seems that there\nwas no evidence against the accused and the witnesses did\nnot support the prosecution case. Even if the prosecution\nagainst the present petitioner is continued, there will not be\nany chance for conviction. In such case, there is no\nmeaning in proceeding with the prosecution case.\n\n3. Moreover, on going through the matter, this Court\nis satisfied that there are no ingredients to invite an offence\nunder Section 308 IPC in the matter. It seems that the\nmatter has been amicably settled between the parties. The\ndefacto complainant, who is the 2\"? respondent and the two\nother injured have filed separate affidavits as Annexures —\nA3(a) to (c) affirming that the matter has been amicably\nsettled between them and the petitioner and they have no\ncomplaints against the petitioner. When the matter has\nbeen amicably settled between the parties, no purpose\n\npete\n\n2016/KER/59\nCRL.M.C.No. 7719 of 2015 ae\nwould be served in proceeding with the matter any further.\nMatters being so, all further proceedings in L.RC.No.3 of\n2009 in C.RNo.102/2008 of the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate's Court-l, Kasaragod, based on Annexure A-1\nFinal Report in Crime No.713 of 2007 of the Kasaragod\nPolice Station, can be quashed.\n\nIn the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and all further\nproceedings in L.RC.No.3 of 2009 in C.PNo.102/2008 of the\nJudicial First Class Magistrate's Court-l, Kasaragod, based\non Annexure A-1 Final Report in Crime No.713 of 2007 of\nthe Kasaragod Police Station, are hereby quashed.\n\nSd/- B.KEMAL PASHA, JUDGE\nul/-\n\n[True copy] PS. to Judge\n\n"
