Subsequently, the petitioners had\napproached this Court for quashing of the\nproceedings and vide order at Annexure - Ad, it\nwas directed by this Court that the\ninvestigation could continue. But the final\nreport has to be filed after seeking permission\nof this Court.\n\n3. Subsequently, the petitioners had\napproached the Sessions Court for modification\nof the direction regarding the appearance\nbefore the investigating officer on every\nSaturday. The order was modified to the effect\nthat they shall appear before the investigating\n\n2020/KER/337\nCrl.MC.No.47 OF 2020 (E)\n3\n\nofficer on every second Saturday. That order at\nAnnexure A-6 is challenged before this Court.\n\nConsidering the facts that the final report\nhas to be filed only after getting permission\nof this Court, I find that the direction to\nappear before the investigating officer on\nevery second Saturday is not very relevant and\nnecessary. The petitioners shall appear before\nthe investigating officer as and when called\nfor. The impugned order is modified to that\neffect.\n\nThe Crl1.M.C is disposed of as above.\n\nSd/-\nASHOK MENON\nJUDGE\n\nSPK\n\nZ er\nElz 4 ie\n2020/KER/337\nCrl1.MC.No.47 OF 2020 (EB)\n4\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE Al THE COPY OF THE FIR NO.1280/2019 OF\nMARADU POLICE STATION.\nANNEXURE A2 THE COPY OF THE PRIVATE COMPLAINT\nLODGED BY THE 2ND RESPONDENT BEFORE THE\nJUDICIAL FIRST CLASS MAGISTRATE COURT-\nVII, ERNAKULAM.\nANNEXURE A3 THE COPY OF THE SALE AGREEMENT EXECUTED\nBETWEEN THE PETITIONERS AND 2ND\nRESPONDENT, DATED 23/09/2015.\nANNEXURE A4 THE COPY OF THE ORDER OF THE HON'BLE\nSESSIONS COURT, ERNAKULAM IN CRL.
