CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON\n07-12-2020, THE COURT ON 07-12-2020 PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\neee\nCrl.MC.No.3885 OF 2016 EE\nORDER\n\nPetitioners are the accused Nos.4 and 5 in CC.No.938/2015\non the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,\nKunnamkulam, for offence punishable under Section 499 of the\nIndian Penal Code. The first petitioner is the editor of\nMathrubhumi Printing and Publishing Company Limited,\nKozhikode and the second petitioner is an employee of\nMathrubhumi daily.\n\n2. First respondent herein is the defacto complainant.\nShe laid a complaint against the petitioners and respondents 2 to\n4, before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kunnamkulam,\nalleging that publication of similar news items by the petitioners\nin Mathrubhumi daily and the respondents 3 and 4 in\nDeshabhimani daily, of which, they were the Chief Editor and\nprinter and publisher respectively were defamatory to her. The\nsecond respondent is an elected member of the Avanoor Grama\nPanchayath.\n\n3. According to Annexure-Al complaint, complainant was\nthe ICDS supervisor of Anganvadis in Avanoor Grama\n\neee\nCrl.MC.No.3885 OF 2016 EE\nPanchayath. Second respondent herein had submitted a\ncomplaint dated 24.10.2014 to the District Collector falsely\nalleging that there were wide spread irregularities and\nfalsification of records and misappropriation of funds in relation to\npurchase and disbursement of the food supplied to the students\nof Anganvadi. It was alleged that the first respondent was\nresponsible for the irregularities and the misappropriation. It was\nfurther alleged that Grama Panchayath had resolved to conduct\nan inspection by a three member committee. They allegedly\ninspected the Anganvadis and found that food materials of good\nquality were not supplied to the students. Huge misappropriation\nof funds were also detected. It was again alleged by the second\nrespondent that on his complaint, food safety authorities had\nvisited the place. They had found that many cereals and pulses\nwere infested with worms. However, the first respondent took\nthem to another store of her choice and drew samples from that\nstore. According to the first respondent, the allegations made by\nthe second respondent in his complaint were absolutely false and\nmade with malafide intention. He gave wide publicity to his\ncomplaint through media, hoardings and flex boards erected at\n\neee\nCrl.MC.No.3885 OF 2016 EE\ndifferent places. Everybody who knew the first respondent could\nidentify that the allegations referred to the first respondent.\n\n4. Asa part of the above, the second respondent also got\nthe news item published in two prominent dailies, Mathrubhumi\nand Deshabhimani. The petitioners herein, without properly\nenquiring into the genuineness of the allegations and without\nattempting to find out the truth involved in the allegation, widely\npublished the news item. A copy of the publication by the\npetitioners was produced as Annexure-A2. It was stated that first\nrespondent informed the petitioners that the news item was\nfalse. However, there no correction was issued by the news\npaper nor they tendered apology for publishing the false news\nitem. It was also stated by the first respondent that the\npublication was intended to cause damage to the reputation of\nthe complainant, to defame her and to lower her reputation\namong the public.\n\n5. The court below on the basis of the prima facie\nmaterials placed, took cognizance of the complaint and issued\nsummons to the accused.\n\n6. Petitioners have approached this court contending that\n\neee\nCrl.MC.No.3885 OF 2016 EE\nthe prosecution is not sustainable. It was contended by the\npetitioners that the prosecution amounted to abuse of the\nprocess of law. They had no intention to lower the dignity or\nreputation of the first respondent. They had only published truth\nof the allegations. No malafide was involved and they had no\nillwill or malice against the first respondent. They prayed to\nquash the proceedings.\n\n7. Supporting the complaint, the learned counsel for the\nfirst respondent contended that there were prima facie materials\navailable on record, which prompted the court below to take\ncognizance of offence. Summons was accordingly issued. The\npetitioners have not challenged the issuance of summons to them\nand without challenging it, they cannot sustain the Crl.M.C. It\nwas also contended, relying on the authorities, that ingredients\nunder sections 499 of IPC were made out. It was also contended\nthat the publication made by the petitioners were sufficient to\ncause harm to the defacto complainant.\n\n8. Annexure-A2, publication dated 07.12.2014 in\nMathrubhumi daily relates to a vigilance raid conducted in three\nAnganvadis and the office of ICDS. Report stated that raid was\n\nae\n\nIRAE\nCrl.MC.No.3885 OF 2016 EE\npursuant to a complaint submitted by the second respondent. It\nwas stated that vigilance enquiry was conducted against the\nformer Secretary of ICDS. It was mentioned that irregularities\nwere found in the distribution of rice, purchase of items, that\nitems were purchased without obtaining proper certificate from\nCivil Supplies Corporation.\n\n9. The main contention set up by the learned counsel for\nthe petitioners was that the complaint was patently and basically\nwrong and not sustainable in sofaras the complaint had not\nspecifically mentioned the _ incriminating allegation, except\nvaguely affirming that the complaint was made malafidely and\nallegations were untrue. The complainant did not specifically\nextract the defamatory part of the publication to enable the\naccused to effectively defend the case. It was contended that the\nabove complaint was patently defective in as much as it had not\ndisclosed the allegations, which specifically constituted the\ndefamatory part of publication and which allegedly affected the\nreputation of the complainant. A reference to the complaint\nshows that in the complaint she has generally referred to\nAnnexure-A2 complaint as false and calculated, to harm her\n\neee\nCrl.MC.No.3885 OF 2016 EE\nreputation. She has vaguely stated that the raid was not\nconducted. However, she has not specifically extracted those\nportions of the publication, which were defamatory to her There\nwere several aspects touching upon the search and the primary\nfindings or the observations arrived out by the search team, in\nthe course of search. Which among those allegations referred to\nin Annexure-Al constituted the defamatory part, has not been\nculled out and specifically extracted in the complaint, it was\ncontended.\n\n10. To support the contention of the petitioners, the\nlearned counsel referred to the decision in Madhavi Amma V\nSherief (1985 KHC 68). In that, the court had held that\nevidently there were defamatory imputations in various\nstatements produced before the court. However, it was noted\nthat at least the substance of the defamatory statements, or\nsuch portions or even their substance were not extracted in the\ncomplaint. On that basis, it was held that a mere reading of the\ncomplaint alone will not impress anybody that the publications\nwere defamatory to any extent. The court held that the complaint\nby itself did not make out a cause of action and quashed the\n\nIRAE\nCrl.MC.No.3885 OF 2016 EE\nproceedings. Identical stand was taken by another bench of this\ncourt in Malayala Manorama Company Litd., and Others V.\nM.M.Lawrence and Others (2020 (3) KHC 512), After going\nthrough the crux of the issue and the complaint, it was held by\nthe learned Single Judge that complaint by itself did not make\nout any defamatory article.\n\n11. Considering the above legal position in the background\nof the facts alleged, I am satisfied that the complaint does not\ndisclose the precise defamatory part of the publication or does\nnot even disclose the defamatory part of publication and to that\nextent, the complaint is patently defective and bad.\n\n12. It was further contended by the learned counsel for the\npetitioners that the question arises, whether publication was\ndefamatory in nature and whether the executive director of the\npublication can be made responsible for the publication made.\nThe learned counsel referred to the decision in Jacob Mathew V\nGangadharan Nair (2001 (2) KLT 412), wherein a Single\nJudge of this court had considered the question whether the\nexecutive editor can be arrayed as an accused in the complaint.\nIt was held that to take cognizance against the executive editor,\n\neee\nCrl.MC.No.3885 OF 2016 EE\nthere must be positive averments about the knowledge of the\neditor in checking the news items, in the complaint. Presumption\nis available only against the editor. In Jacob Mathew V\nManikantan (2012 (3) KLT 824), while apprehending the\npetitioner involved in a crime, his pants came down. The\npublication of the photograph depicting it in a newspaper was\nalleged to be defamatory to the petitioner. Petitioners initiated\nproceedings under Section 499 of IPC against the publication of\nthat photograph. It was held that any fair comment or criticism\nover the events that occurred, that too, made for public good,\nmade by the publication cannot constitute defamation. In\nV.S.Achuthanandan V Kamalamma (2008 (3) KLT 346), it\nwas held that in the absence of any positive evidence implicating\nthe chief editor for selection, printing and publishing of the\ndefamatory article, no complaint will lie against him. It was inter\nalia held that press persons should not be dragged into courts, in\nthe absence of a strong case based on specific and definite\npleadings and averments. It was held that freedom of press is\ninclusive of the fundamental right to freedom of speech and\nexpression, guaranteed under Article 19(1) (a) of the\n\nIRAE\nCrl.MC.No.3885 OF 2016 EE\n10\nConstitution of India.\n\n13. In Mammen Mathew V Radhakrishnan (2007 (4)\nKLT 833), it was held that to ascertain whether an offence under\nSection 499 of the IPC was made out, the important aspect to be\nexamined was whether the news item together with complaint\nmakes out prima facie, the offence under Section 499 of the IPC.\nIt was also held that to ascertain whether the offence under\nSection 499 of the IPC was prime facie made out, the article\nshould be read in its entirety and not in isolation. On facts, it\nwas held that the news item did not give the impression that it\nwas actuated by any malevolent motive or a desire to\ncontaminate or cast aspertion on the complainant.\n\n14. To support the contention of the first respondent, the\ncounsel relied on the decisions reported in M.Kesava Menon\nand Others V P.Raju and Others (2020(5) KHC 335),\nGambhirsingh R. Dekare VY Falgunbhai Chimanbhai Patel\nand Others (AIR 2013 SC 1590) and Mohammed Abdulla\nKhan V Prakash K (AIR 2017 SC 5608).\n\n15. Having evaluated the entire facts in the background of\nthe settled legal position, I am satisfied that a reading of the\n\nIRAE\n\nCrl.MC.No.3885 OF 2016 EE\n11\n\ncomplaint along with the paper publication only reveal that the\npublication mainly related to certain admitted facts and based on\nthe complaint made by the second respondent. Essential facts\nabout the allegations made by the complainant by the second\nrespondent is not disputed. It is also found that the petitioners\npublication is totally different in context and content, from that of\nthe publication made by fourth and fifth respondents in their\nnewspaper and both were published on different dates. Hence,\nboth the publications cannot be clubbed together and accused\ncannot be prosecuted in a composite procedure with respect to\ntwo different publications made on two different dates.\n\nHaving evaluated the entire facts, I feel that the allegations\nin the complaint cannot survive as against the petitioners.\nAccordingly, Crl.M.C is allowed and all further proceedings as\nagainst the petitioners herein in CC.No.938/2015 on the files of\nthe Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kunnamkulam stand\nquashed.\n\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE\nR.AV\n\nma\naS\nsth\nBP) * =\n2021/KER/238\nCrl.MC.No.3885 OF 2016\n12\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE At: A CERTIFIED COPY OF THE COMPLAINT FILED BY\nTHE 1ST RESPONDENT\nANNEXURE A2: TRUE COPY OF THE NEWS ITEM PUBLISHED BY\nTHE PETITIONERS\nRESPONDENT'S/S EXHIBITS NIL\n\n"
