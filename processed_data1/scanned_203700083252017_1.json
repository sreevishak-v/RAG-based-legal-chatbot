TO JUDGE\n\n2017/KER/49571\nP.UBAID, J.\nDated this the 7\" day of December 2017\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner claims to be the registered owner of the\nmotorcycle No.KL-02-AR-9235. On 17.9.2017 at about 7.30\np.m., a small quantity of 20 gms of ganja was seized from the\npossession of the petitioner by the Excise Inspector of the\nKarunagappally Excise Range. The petitioner's motorcycle was\nalso seized by the Excise Inspector at that time. Later, the\nmotorcycle was released to the petitioner under Section 451\nCr.P.C. by the learned Judicial First Class Magistrate,\nKarunagappally on certain conditions as per the order in\nCMP.3270/2017 dated 5.10.2017. The petitioner is aggrieved\nby the condition directing deposit of a cash security of\n%31,500/-, and the said condition is sought to be set aside.\n\n2. On hearing both sides, and on a perusal of the\nmaterials, I find nothing to show that the vehicle was in fact\nused for the transportation of ganja. Just because it is the\nvehicle on which the accused travelled, it cannot be confiscated\nunder the law. The small quantity of ganja was seized from the\n\n2017/KER/49571\nCrl.M.C. No.8325 of 2017\nQe\npossession of the accused. It was not concealed any where on\nthe vehicle, and the vehicle was not in any manner used for the\ntransportation of ganja. Any way, proceedings are now going\non, rightly or wrongly.\n\n3. Inthe above circumstances, where the very seizure of\nthe vehicle was quite unnecessary, I feel it appropriate to set\naside the condition directing cash security for the interim\ncustody of the vehicle under Section 451 Cr.P.C. The other\nconditions imposed by the court below will suffice to cause\nproduction of the vehicle, as and when required.\n\nIn the result, this petition is allowed. The impugned\ncondition directing cash security of %31,500/- will stand set\naside.\n\nSd/-\nP.UBAID\nJUDGE\n//True copy//\nP.A. To Judge\nJvt/7.12.2017\n\n"
