It\nis also submitted that an offence under Section 380 of\nIPC is compoundable whereas Section 457 is non\ncompoundable. The allegation is that the petitioners\ncommitted theft of 5 kg of copper roll worth %500/-. Itis\nsubmitted that now, the matter has been settled.\n3.1 have heard the learned Public Prosecutor as well as\nthe learned counsel for the defacto complainant.\n\nPe ia\ns016ikERISS577\nCrl.M.C. No. 9082 of 2016\n4.Learned counsel for the defacto complainant also\nsubmitted before me that the matter is actually settled.\n5.Surely, Section 457 is a non compoundable offence. At\nthe very same time, considering the totality of the case\nand further keeping in mind that the matter has been\nsettled, I feel that the proceedings can be quashed by\nexercising the power vested upon this Court under\nSection 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Hence,\nthe proceedings in CC No.1127/2015 on the file of the\nAdditional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Ernakulam\nis hereby quashed.\n6.The Crl.M.C. is disposed of, as above.\nSd/-\nK.P.
