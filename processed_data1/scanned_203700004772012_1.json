Annexure A is the\ncomplaint. Gist of allegations against the petitioner is that he entered into\nan agreement with the complainant for purchase of a land. Thereafter the\nland was conveyed to the petitioner by virtue of a registered document. At\nthe time of finalisation of the deal an amount of 78,33,400/- was\noutstanding as balance consideration. Learned counsel for the petitioner\nsubmitted that the vendor/complainant had already agreed to sell this\nproperty to one Dr.Saifu and there was some dispute between the\ncomplainant and Dr.Saifu. which was not known to the petitioner at the\ntime of purchase. Having came to know about that dispute, balance\namount was retained and that is mentioned in an agreement, which is\nproduced as Annexure E. Annexure F is the copy of the plaint filed by\nDr.Saifu against the complainant and his wife claiming compensation for\nthe breach of coniract. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that in\nparagraph 2 of the petition, petitioner has specifically stated that the\namount of %8,33,400/- is retained by the petitioner as agreed to by the\n\n2014/KER/47\n\nCrl.MC No.477/2012 2\nparties in Annexure E for meeting possible future expenses. It is also\nsubmitted that immediately the civil suit is settled or disposed of, the\npetitioner will pay the balance amount found to be due to the complainant\nas stated in Annexure E. On going through the materials on record, | am\nsatisfied that the dispute predominantly is of a civil nature. The offence\nof cheating alleged against the petitioner will not lie in a legal sense\nbecause breach of an agreement cannot be termed as an offence falling\nwithin the definition of cheating under Section 420 of the Indian Penal\nCode. Therefore, the petition is to be allowed to meet the ends of justice.\n\nIn the result, petition is allowed. The complaint in C.C.No.233\nof 2011 pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-lV,\nKunnamkulam is hereby quashed.\n\nAll pending interlocutory applications will stand dismissed.\n\nA. HARIPRASAD, JUDGE.\n\ncks\n\n"
