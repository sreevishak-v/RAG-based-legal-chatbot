CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON\n05.11.2019, THE COURT ON 06.01.2020 PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nCrl.MC.No.1953 OF 2018 2020/KERIT\n2\nR. NARAYANA PISHARADI, J\nCri.M.C No. 1953 of 2018\nORDER\n\nThe petitioners are the accused 1 to 5 in the case C.C\nNo.1236/2017 on the file of the Court of the Judicial First Class\nMagistratre, Chittur.\n\n2. The aforesaid case is one instituted upon the private\ncomplaint (Annexure-A) filed against the petitioners by the first\nrespondent (hereinafter referred to as 'the complainant’).\n\n3. This petition is filed under Section 482 CrP.C for quashing\nthe proceedings initiated against the petitioners based on Annexure-A\ncomplaint. However, the petitioners have not produced copy of the\norder of the learned Magistrate taking cognizance of the offences.\n\n4. The offences alleged against the petitioners in Annexure-A\ncomplaint are punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 452, 341,\n324, 294(b) and 506(ii) read with 149 IPC. Since the petitioners have\nnot produced the copy of the order of the learned Magistrate taking\ncognizance of the offences, it is not possible to ascertain whether the\nlearned Magistrate has taken cognizance of all the offences mentioned\nabove.\n\na\nCrl.MC.No.1953 OF 2018 2020/KERIT\n3\n\n5. The prayer for quashing the proceedings against the\npetitioners is made on the ground that the averments/allegations in\nAnnexure-A complaint do not disclose the ingredients of the aforesaid\noffences alleged against the petitioners.\n\n6. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the first\nrespondent.\n\n7. The material averments contained in Annexure-A complaint\nare as follows: The complainant and the petitioners are neighbours\nand relatives. There were disputes between them regarding diversion\nof water to the property of the complainant. On 15.02.2015, at about\n16:00 hours, the second accused entered into the compound of the\nhouse of the complainant and created a commotion. Then, the first\nand the third accused, who were with the second accused, caught hold\nof the neck of the complainant and pushed him. On that day, at about\n19:00 hours, the accused 1 to 5 entered into the compound of the\nhouse of the complainant and again created a commotion. The third\naccused took a stone and threw it towards Pranav, who is a relative of\nthe complainant, causing injury to Pranav. The first accused beat\nDeepak, another relative of the complainant, with a wooden stick\ncausing injury to him. The accused then trespassed into the house of\nthe complainant. When the mother of the complainant asked them to\n\na\n\nCrl.MC.No.1953 OF 2018 2020/KERIT\n4\n\ngo out of the house, the second accused used obscene words to her\nannoyance. The father of the complainant then reached the house\nafter his work. The accused together then obstructed him. The fourth\naccused beat the father of the complainant with a wooden stick and hit\non his chest and face. The first and the second accused beat the\ncomplainant with a wooden stick. The first accused threatened that he\nwould kill everybody. The accused have committed the aforesaid acts\nin furtherance of their common object.\n\n8. It is doubtful whether the offence punishable under Section\n294(b) IPC alleged against the accused would lie in view of the\naverment that the use of the obscene words by the accused occurred\nwithin the house of the complainant and not in a public place. Apart\nfrom that fact, learned counsel for the petitioners has not pointed out,\nwhy the other offences alleged against the accused would not be\nattracted on the basis of the averments/allegations in the complaint.\nThe averments/allegations in the complaint, prima facie, attract the\ningredients of all the offences alleged against the petitioners/accused\nexcept the offence punishable under Section 294(b) IPC.\n\n9. The complainant is an accused in the case registered by the\npolice for an offence punishable under Section 326 IPC. The aforesaid\ncase is one registered on the basis of the first information statement\n\nBia\n\nCrl.MC.No.1953 OF 2018 2020/KERIT\n5\n\ngiven to the police by the fourth petitioner. The allegation against the\ncomplainant in that case is that, on the same day at about 17:30\nhours, he hit the fourth petitioner with a hammer causing fracture to\nthe bones of his nose and jaw. Existence of such a case against the\ncomplainant is not a sufficient ground to find that the incident alleged\nin the present case did not take place.\n\n10. The complainant had originally filed the complaint against\nthe petitioners on 04.05.2015 in the court and it was forwarded to the\npolice for investigation under Section 156(3) CrP.C. On the basis of\nthe aforesaid complaint, a case was registered against the petitioners\nas Crime No. 415/2015 of Chittur Police Station. But after\ninvestigation, the police referred the aforesaid case as false. The\npresent case (C.C No. 1236/2017) against the petitioners is based on\nthe protest complaint filed by the complainant. Since the\naverments/allegations in that complaint, prima facie, attract the\noffences alleged against the petitioners, the prayer for quashing the\ncomplaint cannot be allowed.\n\n11. Merely for the reason that there was delay on the part of\nthe complainant in filing the original complaint against the petitioners\nit cannot be found that the incident alleged had not taken place.\nWhether the complainant has got any explanation for the delay in\n\na\nCrl.MC.No.1953 OF 2018 2020/KERIT\n6\nfiling the complaint, whether the explanation, if any, given by him is\nsatisfactory or not etc. are matters to be decided by the trial court\nafter taking evidence.\n\n12. It is stated in the petition that the action of the learned\nMagistrate taking cognizance of the offences based on Annexure-A\ncomplaint indicates non-application of mind. However, as noticed\nearlier, the petitioners have not even produced a copy of the order of\nthe learned Magistrate taking cognizance of the offences.\n\n13. In the aforesaid circumstances, I find that there are no\nsufficient grounds to quash Annexure-A complaint or the proceedings\ninitiated against the petitioners on the basis of that complaint. The\npetition is liable to be dismissed.\n\nConsequently, the petition is dismissed.\n\nSd/-R.
