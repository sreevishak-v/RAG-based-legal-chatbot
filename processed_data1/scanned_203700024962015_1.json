No.2496 of 2015\nDated this the 21* day of April, 2015.\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner is the accused in Crime No.14 of 2004\nregistered by the Excise Range Office, Kodungalloor under\nSections 59(a) and 58 (g) of the Abkari Act. It is submitted\nthat the court below has already granted bail to the petitioner.\nBut, unfortunately thereafter, the petitioner went abroad\nseeking employment and now he is employed outside the State\nof Kerala. On account of the above reason, he was unable to\nattend the court, when the matter was taken up for\nconsideration. In the absence of the petitioner, the case was\nsplit up and renumbered as C.P.No.33 of 2007 on the files of\nthe Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kodungalloor, which\nwas latter forwarded to the First Additional Sessions Court,\nThrissur and later, the same was registered as S.C.No.204 of\n2008 which is pending before the First Additional Sessions\nCourt.\n\nStes\nene\n2015/KER/17262\nCri.M.C. No.2496 of 2015\n-~2-\n\n2. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that\nnow he is ready to surrender before the court below and to\nseek regular bail. Apprehension of the petitioner is that as per\nthe practice followed by the learned Magistrate, if he\nsurrenders before the court below, he will be remanded to the\nJudicial Custody, pending consideration of the bail application.\nThe learned counsel for the petitioner urged for a direction to\nthe court below for considering the bail application on the date\nof appearance.\n\n3. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also.\n\nI do not think that the Learned Magistrate will remand\nthe accused mechanically without application of mind.\nHowever, to secure the interest of justice, the court below is\ndirected to consider the application for bail on the date of\nappearance itself.\n\nSd/-\nK.
