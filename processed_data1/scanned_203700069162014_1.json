M.C No.6916 of 2014\nDated this the 8\" day of January, 2015.\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner herein is the original accused No.4 in Crime\nNo.570/2009 of the Nadakkavu Police Station of Kozhikode District,\nregistered under Sections 143, 147, 148, 448, 323 and 324 r/w 149 IPC\non the complaint of one Thaslim Arif, that the petitioners and his co\naccused assaulted him and his friend Musthafa, and inflicted injuries on\ntheir body with weapons. The above of crime was registered as a\ncounter case to another crime involving a sessions offence. Being a\ncounter case to the other crime involving a sessions offence committal to\nthe court of Session was required. The original accused Nos. 1 and 2\nfaced trial before the learned Principal Assistant Sessions Judge,\nKozhikode in S.C No.47/13, and obtained a judgment of acquittal under\nSection 232 Cr.P.C, when none of the material witnesses examined by the\nprosecution supported the prosecution. The case against the accused\nNos. 3 and 4 was split up and refiled. Now the case against the petitioner\nherein is pending in the register of long pending cases as L.P No.2/2014.\nThe petitioner now seeks orders quashing the prosecution as against him\non the ground that in the above circumstances of acquittal of the others\nin the absence of any incriminating circumstance, continuance of the\n\n2015/KER/798\n\nCrl. M.C No.6916 of 2014 2\n\nprosecution as against him will not serve any purpose. The Annexure A5\njudgment in S.C No.47/2013 shows that the prosecution examined 7\nwitnesses in that case including the de facto complainant Thaslim Arif,\nand marked Exts. Pl to P6. Of course, the prosecution could not procure\nthe presence of the other injured witness cited as CW2. It was reported\nto the trial that he is not available for examination, and that his\nwhereabouts are not known. The de facto complainant (first informant)\nThaslim Arif examined as PW2 did not in any manner support the\nprosecution. The occurrence witnesses examined by the prosecution also\ndid not support the prosecution during trial. The judgment shows that\nthey all turned hostile during trail, in view of a settlement arrived at out\nof court by the parties.\n\n2. This court directed the Station House Officer to report\nwhether CW2 cited by the prosecution is now available at the locality for\nexamination. On instruction, the learned Public Prosecutor submitted that\nhe is still not available, and that his whereabouts are not known. The\nsubstratum of the prosecution case stands totally lost by the acquittal of\nthe others under Section 232 Cr.P.C. No doubt, the prosecution cannot in\nany manner improve the case as against the others, and the material\nwitnesses also will not in any manner help the prosecution, if the case\nagainst the others goes to trial. Practically, continuance of prosecution\nagainst the others will be a sheer waste of time. That the petitioner\nabsconded, or that the case now stands transferred to the register of long\n\nCae\n2015/KER/798\nCrl. M.C No.6916 of 2014 3\npending cases cannot be a ground to deny relief, when the court is well\nsatisfied that continuance of the trial process against him will not serve\nany purpose.\n\nIn the result, this petition is allowed. The prosecution against the\npetitioner herein in crime No.570/2009 of the Nadakavu Police Station,\nwhich is now pending before the court of Session, Kozhikode in L.P\nNo.2/2014 will stand quashed under Section 482 Cr.P.C.\n\nP.UBAID,\nJUDGE\nsab\n\n"
