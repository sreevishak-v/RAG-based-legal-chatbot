M.C No.457 of 2013\nDated this the 5\" day of January, 2015.\nORDER\nThe petitioner herein is the accused in a prosecution brought\nunder Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act before the\nJudicial First Class Magistrate, Kolenchery, by the second\nrespondent herein. As the complaint was delayed by 22 days, the\nsecond respondent filed C.M.P 375/2012 for condonation of the\ndelay. The petitioner herein entered appearance, and resisted the\napplication to condone delay. On being satisfied of the reason\nstated for delay in the affidavit the learned Magistrate condoned the\nsaid delay as per the order dated 8.6.2012 in C.M.P 375/2012.\nAggrieved by the said order, the petitioner approached the court of\nSession, Ernakulam with Cr]. R.P 100/2012. Finding no merit in the\ncase advanced by the petitioner, the learned Sessions Judge\ndismissed the Crl.R.P 100/2012 on 10/12/2012. The said order is\nunder challenge in this proceeding brought under Section 482\nCr.P.C.\n\n2. The learned counsel for the petitioner relies on Kishco Ltd\n(M/s.) v. K.A Vincent @ Wilson Alex and Another 2012 (3)\n\n2015/KER/25\nCri. M.C No.457 of 2013 2\nKHC 495. The said decision cannot be mechanically applied to all\ncases. What exactly is the reason for delay, or whether such reason\nis acceptable, or whether the delay stands explained, are all factors\nvarying from case to case. A straight jacket formula regarding the\ncircumstances in which delay can be condoned, or the grounds that\ncan be accepted for condonation of delay, cannot be made by\nprecedents. In this case the delay is really very short, and it is of\nonly 22 days. The amount involved in the case is Rs.13,00,000/-\n(Rupees Thirteen lakhs). In such a circumstance, the request to\ncondone delay cannot be mechanically approached. If such an\napproach is made and the short delay is not condoned, the accused\nwill stand benefited, probably unlawfully. Discretion in the matter of\ndelay cannot be exercised in favour of such persons and in such\ncircumstances. In this case I find that there is sufficient and\nsatisfactory explanation for the delay, and that decision in the\nmatter of delay was properly, legally and rightly taken by the courts\nbelow. I find no reason or ground to interfere.\n\nIn the result, this Crl.M.C is dismissed.\nP.UBAID,\n\nob JUDGE\n\n"
