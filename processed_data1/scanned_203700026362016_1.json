TO JUDGE\nPI\n\nPeas\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.Y, J. ELS\n Cri.M.C.No. 2636 of 2016\nDated this the 01* day of August, 2016\nORDER\n\n1.The petitioners are the accused Nos. 1 and 2 in\nC.C.No.194 of 2000 on the files of the Judicial\nMagistrate of First Class, Kodungallur. They are charged\nfor having committed offence punishable under Sections\n420, 427 and Section 34 of the IPC. The respondent\nNo. 2 is the de facto complainant, who has lodged the\ncomplaint for and on behalf of the 3 respondent.\n\n2.The instant petition is filed under Section 482 of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure banking on the ratio of the\nJudgment rendered by the Apex Court in Gian Singh v.\nState of Punjab ( 2012 (4) KLT 108) and a series of\nother cases which include Narinder Singh and others\nv. State of Punjab and Another (2014) 6 SCC 466)\nand Yogendra Yadav and others V_ State _ of\nJharkhand (2014 (9) SCC 653 ) with a prayer to quash\nthe above proceeding.\n\n3.The sole ground is that the Apex Court in the above\n\nPee\n2016/KER/33656\n\nCrl.M.C.No. 2636 of 2016 ;\njudgments have delineated the circumstances and the\ncases in which inherent powers under Section 482 can\nbe invoked de hors section 320 of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure for recognizing out of court settlement for the\npurpose of quashing criminal proceedings. It is prayed\nthat powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure be invoked to quash the criminal\nproceedings.\n\n4. The prosecution allegation is that the first accused had\navailed a loan of Rs.25,000/- from the Pappinivattom\nService Co-operative Bank of which the 2™ respondent\nis the Secretary. The property having an extent of 19.5\ncents was mortgaged. It is alleged that later the\naccused had extracted earth from the mortgaged\nproperty and thus caused loss to the _ defacto\ncomplainant.\n\n5.The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submits\nthat no other cases are reported against the petitioners.\n\n6.1 have given my anxious’ consideration to the\n\nPee\n2016/KER/33656\n\nCrl.M.C.No. 2636 of 2016 3\nsubmissions made across the bar and I have also gone\nthrough the materials on record.\n\n7.The 2™ respondent has sworn to an affidavit wherein it\nis asserted that he has no objection in allowing the\npetition and in quashing the proceedings as all the\ndisputed between the parties have been resolved. All\nfinancial transactions between the 3% respondent and\nthe petitioners herein have been settled.\n\n8.It appears to me that the offence is entirely personal in\nnature and do not affect public peace or tranquility. It is\nalso felt that quashing of proceedings on account of\ncompromise would bring about peace. In a case such as\nthe instant one, even if the prosecution is allowed to\ncontinue, it would not serve any purpose as the\npossibility of conviction is remote and bleak. It can only\nresult in putting the de facto complainant and the\naccused to unwanted oppression and _ prejudice.\nSettlement will augur well for the interest of the\ncommunity and will enable the parties to live in peace\n\nDae\na pide\n2016/KER/33656\nCrl.M.C.No. 2636 of 2016\n4\nand harmony.\n9.1 am of the view that this Court is well justified in\nquashing the impugned proceedings as the instant case\nfalls within the matrix of guidelines issued by the Apex\nCourt in Gian Singh (Supra) and the other cases\nreferred to above.\n\nIn the result, this petition is allowed. All further\nproceedings against the petitioners in C.C.No.194 of\n2000 on the files of the Judicial Magistrate of First\nClass, Kodungallur, shall stand quashed.\n\nSd/-RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.YV,\nJudge\nIsn\n\n"
