M.C No. 7 of 2015\nDated this the 6\" day of January, 2015.\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner herein is the sole accused in C.C No.254/2013\nof the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Malappuram. Crime in\nthe case was registered under Sections 341, 323, 324 and 506(i)\nIPC on the complaint of one Anwar Sadath. He is the second\nrespondent in this proceeding. The petitioner seeks orders quashing\nthe prosecution on the ground that he and Anwar Sadath have come\nto terms amicably out of court. The de facto complainant Anwar\nSadath has filed affidavit to the effect that he has settled the\ndispute with the accused, and he has no grievance or complaint. I\nfind that the parties have really come to terms amicably, and\ncontinuance of prosecution in such a situation will not serve any\npurpose, other than wasting the precious time of the court.\n\nIn the result, this petition is allowed. The prosecution against\nthe petitioner in C.C No.254/2013 of the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate Court, Malappuram will stand quashed under Section 482\n\naan\nPe phates\noa\n2015/KER/209\nCrl. M.C No. 7 of 2015 2\nCr.P.C. Accordingly, he will stand released from prosecution,\nand the bail bond, if any, executed by him will stand\ndischarged.\nP.UBAID,\nJUDGE\nsab\n\n"
