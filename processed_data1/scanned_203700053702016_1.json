TO JUDGE\nEL\n\nae\n2017/KER/49291\nB. KEMAL PASHA, J.\nee ee\nORDER\n\nAnnexure A6 order passed under Section 319 Cr.PC.\nby the Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-l, Kanjirappally\nfor arraigning the petitioner as the 4\" accused in\nC.C.No.221/2013 is under challenge. Originally, the\npetitioner was arraigned as the 4\" accused in the FIR. After\ninvestigation, Annexure A1 final report was filed as against\nA1 to A3 alone by deleting A4 from the array of accused.\n\n2. The prosecution examined PWs.1 and 2 in chief\nbefore the court below. It seems that the chief-examination\nitself is not complete. Material objects were not produced\nand therefore, the material objects were to be identified, for\nwhich the chief-examination has to continue.\n\nBee\n2017/KER/49291\nCRL.M.C.No. 5370 of 2016\n“2:\n\n3. PW1, who is the defacto complainant, filed\nAnnexure A5 petition before the court below under Section\n319 CrPC. for arraigning the petitioner also as the 4\"\naccused in the case. The court below passed Annexure A6\norder in the following lines:\n\n“Heard the petitioner's counsel. On a\nperusal of the deposition of PW1 and\nPW2 in their chief examinations it is clear\nthat the complicity of 4° accused in FIR,\nthat is Harris is established in the\ncommission of the alleged offences.\nHence the petition is allowed.”\n\n4. According to the learned counsel for the\npetitioner, the court below has committed a grave error in\nnot passing a speaking order. The circumstances in which\nthe application of Section 319 CrPC. has become\nnecessitated, have not been shown in Annexure 6. The\nlearned counsel for the petitioner as well as the learned\ncounsel for the 2\" respondent have relied on the decision of\n\nae\n2017/KER/49291\nCRL.M.C.No. 5370 of 2016 uae\nthe Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in Hardeep Singh\nand others v. State of Punjab[2014(1) KHC 170] wherein\nspecific parameters have been prescribed for enabling the\napplication of Section 319 Cr.PC.\n\n5. According to the petitioner, the details of the\npetitioner who has to be impleaded as the 4\" accused have\nnot been furnished. Apart from stating that ‘Harris of\nKanjirappally’, details of the petitioner and his address have\nnot been furnished anywhere in the chief-examination of\nPWs.1 and 2 or Annexure 5. In Annexure A5 what has been\nstated is that the 4\" accused in the FIR has to be arraigned\nas the 4\" accused in the case. On a perusal of Annexure A1\nFIR in page No.22 of the paper book, it seems that the 4\"\naccused, who was arraigned in the FIR, was ‘Harris relative\nof Shameer’. Without furnishing the details of the persons\nto be arraigned as accused, the court below ought not to\nhave passed an order arraigning the petitioner as the 4\"\naccused. Apart from that, the court below ought to have\n\n2017/KER/49291\nCRL.M.C.No. 5370 of 2016 wae\nshown cogent reasons for arraigning the petitioner as the 4\"\naccused under Section 319 CrPC. It is not discernible from\nAnnexure A6 as to how the learned Magistrate could invoke\nSection 319 CrPC.\n\nIn the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure A6\norder is hereby quashed. Annexure Ad is remitted to the\ncourt below for fresh disposal in accordance with law. The\ncourt below shall scrupulously follow the decision in\nHardeep Singh(supra) for disposing of Annexure A5.\n\nSd/- B. KEMAL PASHA, JUDGE.\n“ /{ true copy //\nPS. to Judge.\n\n"
