CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n04.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nee\na\nCB\n2019/KER/365\nCrl.MC.No. 8611 of 2018\n-2-\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner is the accused in Crime C.R. No.15\nof 2018 of Excise Enforcement and Anti Narcotic Special\nSquad, Palakkad registered for the offence under Section\n20(b)(Gi)C of NDPS Act. The petitioner was granted bail by\nthe court below as per Annexure — A order.\n\n2. The petitioner has filed this Crl.M.C. praying for\nsetting aside or modifying condition Nos.1 to 3 in\nAnnexure — A order.\n\n3. Heard.\n\n4. Annexure — A order contains four conditions,\nwhich are extracted hereunder:-\n\n“1. The petitioner shall be released on bail\nupon execution of bond for Rs.3,00,000/-\n\nee\n2019/KER/365\nCrl.MC.No. 8611 of 2018\n-3-\n(Rupees three lakhs only) with two solvent\nsureties each for the like sum to the\nsatisfaction of this court. The sureties shall\nproduce solvency certificates for the said\namount. One of the parents of the petitioner\nshall also appear before this court and execute\nbail bond.\nHe shall also deposit a sum of Rs.75,000/-\n(Rupees seventy five thousand only) as cash\nsecurity simultaneous to the execution of bail\nbond.\n2. He shall appear before the\nInvestigating Officer twice on every day at\nmorning and evening until further orders\nimmediately after his release from jail.\n3. He shall surrender his passport if any\nbefore the court while executing bail bond or\nfile affidavit m the event he does not hold\npassport along with a report of verification in\n\nee\na\naes\n2019/KER/365\nCrl.MC.No. 8611 of 2018\n-4-\n\nthat regard by the S.I. of Police within whose\n\nterritorial limits the petitioner resides.\n\n4. He shall not get involved in any offence\n\nwhile on bail.”\n\n5. When this matter has been taken up for hearing,\nthe learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the\npetitioner will be satisfied if condition No.1 is modified.\nThe court below directed the petitioner to deposit\nRs.75,000/-. The learned Public Prosecutor has no serious\nobjection in reducing the amount to Rs.50,000/-. The other\ncondition was that the surety should produce solvency\ncertificate for the bond amount. Even though the bail was\ngranted on 15.11.2018, the bail could not be executed as the\nsureties of the petitioner were not able to produce the\nsolvency certificate, submitted by the learned counsel. In\n\nre\nCIP\n2019/KER/365\nCrl1.MC.No. 8611 of 2018\n_5-\nview of the submission of the learned counsel for the\npetitioner, it is directed that instead of producing the\nsolvency certificate, sureties need to produce only the tax\nreceipt of their properties. The petitioner shall also deposit\nan amount of Rs.50,000/- (Rupees fifty thousand only)\nbefore the court below, instead of Rs.75,000/- directed by\nthe court below, simultaneously at the time of executing the\nbond.\n6. The prosecution allegation is that the petitioner was\nfound in possession of 36.526 Kgs. of Hashish oil in liquor form in\nan Alto Maruti Car on 19.3.2018 at about 11 a.m., in contravention\nof the provisions of the NDPS Act. Considering the nature and\ngravity of the allegations, I do not find any reason to interfere\nwith condition Nos.2 to 4 in Annexure — A order.\n\neee\na\nCIP\n2019/KER/365\nCr1.MC.No. 8611 of 2018\n-6-\nIn the result, this Crl.M.C. stands disposed of as\nabove.\nDated this the 4\" day of January 2019.\nsd\nB.
