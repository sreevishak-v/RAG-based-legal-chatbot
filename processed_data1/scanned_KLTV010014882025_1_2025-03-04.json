NAZEERA.S, SESSIONS JUDGE\nOn Tuesday, 4\" day of March 2025/13\" day of Phalguna, 1946.\nCriminal M.C.No. 629/2025\nCrime No 325/2025 of Venjaramood Police Station\nPetitioner/Accused No. 1 :-\n\nAseem S aged 27 years S/o. Shamsheer\n\nKunnil Veedu Nedumkaitha Koonanvenga P.O\n\nPullampara Village Nedumangadu Taluk\n\nBy Advocate:- S Y Mohan Kumar Kiran\nCounter Petitioners :-\n\n1. State of Kerala\n2. Station House Officer\n\nVenjaramoodu Police Station\n\nBy Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumari\n\nThis Criminal M.C. is coming on for hearing on 03.03.2025 and the court\non 04.03.2025 passed the following\n\nORDER\n\nThis is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik\nSuraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail.\n\n2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable\nunder Sections 126, 296(b), 118(1) and 324, r/w Section 3(5) of the Bharatiya\nNyaya Sanhita, and Crime No. 325/2025 of Venjaramood Police Station is\nregistered against the petitioner arraying him as the 1* accused.\n\n2\n\n3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- On 18.02.2025 at\nabout 6 p.m., accused Nos. 1 to 3 trespassed into the Provision Store run by\nthe defacto complainant, situated in Panvoor Village, and demanded cotton\nbandage. The defacto complainant informed the accused that cotton bandage is\nnot available in his shop. Infuriated by this, the accused uttered abusive words\nagainst the defacto complainant and rambled and destroyed the chilly powder\nand bakery products kept in the shop, causing a loss of Rs.1,500/- to the defacto\ncomplainant. When the defacto complainant intervened, the 2\" accused caught\nhold of his collar and the 1* accused fisted him on his forehead, using a sharp\nweapon, causing an injury. Thereafter, all the accused repeatedly fisted on the\nback and head of the defacto complainant.\n\n4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor.\nThe Investigating Officer filed report opposing the bail application.\n\n5. Heard. Perused the records.\n\n6. The only point to be considered is, whether pre-arrest bail can be\ngranted to the petitioner/ 1* accused.\n\n7. The Point:- The petitioner / 1° accused along with the other\naccused are alleged to have abused the defacto complainant and assaulted him,\nand the petitioner/ 1* accused had used a sharp weapon to fist on the forehead\nof the defacto complainant, causing injuries. The motive for the alleged\n\n3\nincident is the rage that aroused when the defacto complainant told the accused\nthat the cotton bandage demanded by them is not available in his shop.\n\n8. According to the petitioner, he is innocent of the allegations\nlevelled against him. It is submitted that, on the fateful day, one Shiju, who is\nconducting a stationery store, abused and assaulted the petitioner, and the\npetitioner filed a complaint in this regard before the Venjaramoodu Police\nStation, and no action was taken so far, and it is thereafter, the defacto\ncomplainant filed a complaint against the petitioner and others and falsely\nimplicated them in this crime.\n\n9. There is serious allegation as against the petitioner. In the First\nInformation Statement given by the defacto complainant, it is stated that, the\npetitioner/Ist accused along with the other accused had assaulted the defacto\ncomplainant, and in that process, the petitioner / 1* accused had fisted on his\nforehead using a sharp weapon, causing an injury. In the body note with the\nFirst Information Statement, it is noted that, the defacto complainant had wound\nover forehead and pain on back. So, there is corresponding injuries. So, the\nprosecution has made out a prima facie case against the petitioner/ 1 accused\nand regarding the involvement of the petitioner in the alleged offence. It is\nstated in the report that, the ring used for the commission of the offence is to be\nrecovered, and the wound certificate of the victim is to be obtained. The\ninvestigation is progressing. Considering the facts stated in the report to the\n\n4\n\neffect that the petitioner is involved in the offence, it appears that exceptional\njurisdiction to grant a pre-arrest bail cannot be exercised in this case.\n\n10. In Jai Prakash Singh v. State of Bihar and Another (2012 (4)\nSCC 379), the Hon’ble Apex court has held that, an order of pre-arrest bail\nbeing an extra ordinary privilege, should be granted only in exceptional cases. It\nis settled in law that arrest should be the last option and it should be restricted to\ncases where arrest is imperative in the facts and circumstances of a case and\nconsistent view is that the grant of anticipatory bail shall be restricted to\nexceptional circumstances. So it is clear that the power to grant anticipatory bail\nunder section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita. is an exceptional\npower and should be exercised only in exceptional cases and not as a matter of\ncourse. Its object is to ensure that a person should not be harassed or humiliated\nin order to satisfy the grudge or personal vendetta of the complainant. [Reliance\nplaced on the decision rendered by the Hon’ble Apex Court in HDFC Bank\nLimited v. J.J. Mannan and Another (2010 (1) SCC 679); Srikant Upadhyay\nv. State of Bihar (2024 KHC Online 6137)]. In the case at hand, I find no\nexceptional circumstance to exercise the exceptional power of granting\nanticipatory bail.\n\n11. Considering the serious allegation against the petitioner and gravity\nof the offence, it appears that granting the petitioner with an order of\nanticipatory bail will adversely affect the investigation. If an order of\n\n5\nanticipatory bail is granted he is likely to influence the witnesses and tamper\nwith the evidence. Considering all these aspects, this court is not inclined to\ngrant an order of pre-arrest bail to the petitioner.\nIn the result, this petition is dismissed.\nDictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and\npronounced by me in Open Court on this the 4\" day of March, 2025\nSd/-\nNAZEERA S.\nSESSIONS JUDGE\n\n(Copies : 4)\n\nTypedby =: Manjusha True copy By Order\n\nCompared by : Soumya\n\nE.C.S: SHERISTADAR\n\n6\nCopy of Order in\nCrl.M.P.
