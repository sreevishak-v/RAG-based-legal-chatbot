CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n11.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nBe\nBleRee et\n2024/KER/4272\nCRL.MC NO. 72 OF 2024\n2\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.\nDated this the 11% day of January, 2024\nORDER\n\nPetitioners are the accused in C.C.No.852/2015\non the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate’s\nCourt, Ottappalam. They face an indictment for the\noffences under Section 18(a)(i) r/w Section 27(d) of the\nDrugs and Cosmetic Act, 1940 (for short, ‘the Act’).\n\n2. The prosecution allegations are that on 22-04-\n2013, when the Drugs Inspector drew a sample of\nCefotaxime Injection IP 250 from the Taluk Head\nQuarter’s Hospital, Ottappalam, manufactured by the\nlst accused, it was found, on analysis, to be not of\nstandard quality due to the failure to clear the test for\nsterility. Since a sub-standard drug had been\nmanufactured and sold by the accused, they are\nalleged to have committed the offences alleged.\n\n3. The complaint was filed on 16-05-2016 and\ncognizance was taken in the same year. Petitioners\n\nBe\nBlea\n2024/KER/4272\nCRL.MC NO. 72 OF 2024\n3\n\nhave been participating in the proceedings before the\nTrial Court. However, after 9 years of taking\ncognizance, they have now approached this Court,\npointing out that their prosecution is an abuse of\nprocess of the Court, primarily on account of the\nviolation of the mandatory provisions of Section 23(4)\n(iii) and Section 25(3) of the Act.\n\n4. According to Adv.Susmith Kumar T.D., the\nvaluable rights of the accused have been denied due to\nthe failure of the Drugs Inspector to provide the third\nsample of the drug as contemplated under Section\n23(iv)(3) of the Act and also because the certificate of\nanalysis and the test report were not forwarded to the\npetitioners, thereby contravening the provisions of the\nstatute. He relies upon the decision Laborate\nPharmaceuticals India Ltd. And Others v. State of\nTamil Nadu (2018) 15 SCC 93 in support of his\ncontentions.\n\n5. Sri. Grashious Kuriakose, the learned ADGP\ncontended that the challenge to the prosecution\nproceedings by invoking the provisions of Section 482\n\nBe\nBlea\n2024/KER/4272\nCRL.MC NO. 72 OF 2024\n4\n\nof Cr.P.C., is too belated, especially since the trial is\nabout to start. He further argued that all contentions\nnow raised by the petitioners can be agitated before\nthe trial Court and that no valuable rights of the\naccused have been denied since the mandatory\ndocuments were all forwarded to the accused within\ntime. It was further contended that the accused had,\nin fact, refused to accept the documents that were\nsent, and hence it is a matter for trial, where evidence\nmay have to be appreciated.\n\n6. While considering the contentions advanced\nby the respective counsel, this court takes note of the\ncircumstance that the complaint was filed in 2015 and\ncognizance was taken as C.C.No.852/2015 by the\nlearned Magistrate. Concededly, the matter has been\npending before the trial Court for the last 9 years and\nthe case is ripe for trial. Contentions now raised by\nthe petitioners and controverted by the prosecution\nfall within the realm of disputed facts and require\nappreciation of evidence, especially in the light of the\nsubmission on behalf of the prosecution that the\n\nBe\nBe anes 4\n2024/KER/4272\nCRL.MC NO. 72 OF 2024\n5\nmandatory documents were all sent to the petitioner,\nwhich was refused to be received by him.\n\n7. In such a view of the matter, I am of the\nopinion that the remedy under Section 482 is not\navailable to the petitioner. Hence, I find no merit in\nthis Crl.M.C. and it is dismissed.\n\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\nAJM\n\nBee eel\nBiz eas\n2024/KER/4272\nCRL.MC NO. 72 OF 2024\n6\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 72/2024\n\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES\n\nAnnexure A-1 A TRUE COPY OF THE FORM 17 DATED\n22/04/2013 ISSUED BY THE DRUGS\nINSPECTOR TO SUPERINTENDENT,\nTALUK HEAD QUARTER HOSPITAL\n\nAnnexure 2 A TRUE COPY OF THE FORM 18 DATED\n24/04/2013 ISSUED BY THE DRUGS\nINSPECTOR TO GOVERNMENT ANALYST\n\nAnnexure A-3 A TRUE COPY OF THE CERTIFICATE\nOF TEST OR ANALYSIS IN FORM 13\nNO.
