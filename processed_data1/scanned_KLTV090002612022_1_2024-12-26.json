This case is instituted upon the Final Report filed by the Sub Inspector of\nPolice, Sreekaryam Police Station in Crime No. 1857/21 for the offences\npunishable under Sections 294(b), 323, 324, 427 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code,\n1860.\n2. The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: The Informant is the uncle\nof the 1%t and 2™ Accused. Due to the prior animosity towards the Informant, in\nfurtherance of the common intention of the Accused persons to voluntarily cause\nhurt to the Informant, on 19.11.2021 at 8.00 pm at Pangappara at the road nearby\nS J Bhavan House; the 2™? Accused showered obscene words on the Informant who\nattempted to resist the Accused persons form causing hurt to his nephew, and hit\non his left wrist with a wooden log. The 1* Accused lifted up the sister of the\nInformant who had come there by getting hold of her nightie and dropped her\ndown, resulting her dress to be torn. The ist and 2™ Accused caught hold of her\nhusband, pushed him down to the floor and kicked him. The gold chain of the\n\n3\n\nnephew of the Informant was lost in the scuffle. Thereby the Accused are alleged\nto have committed the above-mentioned offences.\n3. The cognizance was taken on the basis of Final Report in respect of the\noffences under Sections 294(b), 323, 324, 427 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code,\n1860. On issuance of process, the Accused Persons entered appearance before this\nCourt. They were enlarged on bail. They were represented by a Counsel of their\nown choice. Copies of all relevant Prosecution records were furnished to them.\nAfter hearing both parties and on perusing relevant records, charge was framed\nfor the offences punishable under Sections 294(b), 323, 324, 427 r/w 34 of the\nIndian Penal Code, 1860 and the same was read over and explained to them, to\nwhich they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.\n4. From the side of Prosecution CW1 alone was examined as PW1. The\nremaining witnesses were given up by the Learned APP as the material witness,\nthe injured herself had turned hostile to the case of Prosecution. The other\npersons, the relatives of the injured though alleged to have been injured in the\nFinal Report, none of them were arrayed as Charge Witnesses. Since no\nincriminating circumstances arose from the depositions of the witnesses, the\nexamination of the Accused under Section 313(1)(b) of the CrPC was dispensed\nwith. No Defence evidence was also adduced.\n5. Heard both sides and perused the documents. The following points arise for\nconsideration:\n\n(a) Have the Accused persons, in furtherance of their common intention,\n\nuttered obscene words to PW1 and thereby committed the offence\n\npunishable under section 294 (b)r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged\n\n(b) Have the Accused persons, in furtherance of their common intention,\n\nvoluntarily caused hurt to PW1 and thereby committed offence punishable\n\nunder Section 323 of the IPC as alleged?\n\n4\n\n(c) Have the Accused persons, in furtherance of their common intention,\n\nvoluntarily caused hurt to PW1 with wooden log and thereby committed\n\noffence punishable under Section 324 of the IPC as alleged?\n\n(d) Have the Accused Persons in furtherance of their common intention on\n\nthe same caused mischief and thereby committed the offence punishable\n\nunder section 427 r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged?\n\n(d) If so, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded?\n\n6. Points (a) to (c): These points are considered together for the sake of\nbrevity and for avoiding repetition.\n\nPW1 deposed that he resides in Manvila. He deposed that he had not\nsustained any injury in this incident. He does not remember the exact date of the\nincident as two years have already lapsed. It was around late evening, there was\nan argument at his house by some people and the police had come. He had given\nExhibit P1 statement to the police regarding the incident. He deposed that at the\ntime of the incident, his wife and sister were present there. Neither any damage,\nnor any mischief was caused in the incident. There was contusion on his hand on\naccount of his hand having been held by them. He deposed that he can very well\nidentify the persons who had so assaulted him. But, the Accused persons were not\ninvolved in that incident. he is unable to identify the assailants who assaulted him.\nTo the leading question put forth by the Learned APP as to whether he had settled\nthe matter between the parties, he categorically deposed that there is one more\ncase pending before this Court between same parties, in which he is one of the\nAccused; and that both the cases have been settled by them, and he has already\nfiled a Compromise Petition to that effect.\n\nOn perusal of the evidence led by the Prosecution and the materials on\nrecord, it is clear from the testimony of PW1 that there is no evidence to support\nthe Prosecution case. It is pertinent to note that the parties are relatives and the\n\n5\n\nother persons alleged to have been injured in the Final Report is not even arrayed\nas Charge Witnesses. Furthermore, the fact that PW1 was injured is brought from\nhis evidence. But there is no whisper that that it was the Accused persons who had\nallegedly assaulted him. Thus, there is nothing material on record to prove the\nProsecution case. Also, Compromise Petition was filed as CMP 3650/2024. The\nsame was rejected and disallowed for the reason that offences involved non-\ncompoundable Offences well. Further, PW1 admitted the said factum of\ncomposition and settlement between parties when he mounted the box. In the\naforesaid circumstances, the remaining witness was given up by the Prosecution as\nno purpose would be served in examining him in the above circumstances. Neither\nthe ingredients of the alleged offences, nor the involvement of the Accused persons\nbrought out in the evidence adduced by the Prosecution. Thus, this Court is of the\nview that the Prosecution has miserably failed to prove the involvement of this\nAccused persons in the above Crime beyond reasonable doubt. Hence, this Court\nfinds that the Prosecution has failed to prove the case against the Accused and\ntherefore, Points (a) to (c) are found in favour of the Accused.\n\n7. Point (d): In light of finding in the foregoing points, this point does not\narise for consideration.\n\nIn the result, the Accused persons are found not guilty of having\ncommitted the offences punishable under Sections 294(b), 323, 324, 427 r/w 34 of\nthe Indian Penal Code, 1860. He is acquitted of the aforesaid offences under\nSection 248(1) of the CrPC. His bail bond stands cancelled and he is set at liberty.\n\n(Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her,\ncorrected by me and pronounced in open Court on this, the 26\" day of December,\n2024.)\n\nJudicial Magistrate of I Class -I,\nThiruvananthapuram\n\n6\nAPPENDIX\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nPW1 Santhosh Kumar(CW1) Ocurrence Witness\nexamined on 26.11.2024\nB: Defence witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nC: Court witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA.
