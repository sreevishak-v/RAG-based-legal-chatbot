SUB INSPECTOR OF POLICE\nCHINGAVANAM 686 531\nBY SRI.ALEX M.THAMBRA, PUBLIC PROSECUTOR\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC, CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 03-01-2018,\nTHE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\nR.AV\n\nnl\n\nrapa\n\nSUNIL THOMAS, J EE\n\nCrl.M.C.No.8763 of 2017\nDated this the 3Â° day of January, 2018\nORDER\nThe petitioner herein is arrayed as the second\naccused in Crime No.1020 of 2016 of Chingavanam Police\nStation for offences punishable under sections 342, 323,\n324 and 302 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal\nCode. After investigation, final report was laid and the\nmatter is pending as CP.No.50.2017 before the Judicial\nFirst Class Magistrate Court-I, Changanasserry. The case\nstood posted to 23.11.2017 for the appearance of the\naccused. It is stated that on that day, the petitioner\nappeared through counsel and filed vakkalath along with\nan application to excuse the absence of accused. The\nreason stated was that he was suffering from illness. The\ncase was adjourned to 14.12.2017 on which day also the\npetitioner herein was absent. The reason stated was that\nthe petitioner had not recovered from the illness. The\ncourt below rejected the application for excusing the\nabsence of the accused and issued non bailable warrant.\n\nnl\nCrl.M.C.No.8763 of 2017\n2\n\n2. The petitioner has approached this court\ncontending that he was appearing before the court below\nthrough the counsel and was effectively represented by\nthe counsel. However, the petitioner submits that he is\nready and willing to appear before the court below and to\nsubmit himself to its jurisdiction and also to appear on all\nfuture posting dates personally or through the counsel.\nThe only anxiety of the petitioner herein is that since non\nbailable warrant has been issued, he is likely to be\nremanded.\n\n3. Having considered the fact that the petitioner\nherein was effectively represented through the counsel on\nboth the occasion, I am inclined to permit the petitioner\nherein to surrender before the court below within a period\nof ten days from today. If he so appears and files\napplication for recalling the warrant, the application shall\nbe taken up by the court below on the same day itself and\nshall pass appropriate orders in accordance with law. The\nwarrant issued by the court below will be kept in\n\nEur\nBien\n2018/KER/46\nCrl.M.C.No.8763 of 2017\n3\nabeyance till the date of his appearance within the above\nten days.\nCrl.M.C is disposed of as above.\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE\nR.AV\n//True Copy//\nPA to Judge\n\n"
