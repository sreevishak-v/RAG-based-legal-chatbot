TO JUDGE\nrsÂ°\n\n2016/KER/33887\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN V., J.\n~ Cri. M.C. No.4781 of 2016\nDated this the 3\" day of August, 2016\nORDER\n\n1.The petitioner herein is the accused in Crime No. 4 of\n2016 of Thrissur Excise Range. The aforesaid crime has\nbeen registered alleging offence punishable under\nSection 20(b) ii(B) of the Narcotic Drugs and\nPsychotropic Substances Act. The prosecution\nallegation is that the petitioner was found in possession\nof 1.200 kg of dry Ganja which was kept for the purpose\nof sale.\n\n2.The petitioner was arrested on 23.4.2016 and his\napplication for bail was allowed by Annexure-A order.\nHe was directed to execute a bond for Rs.50,000/- with\ntwo solvent sureties each for the like sum to the\nsatisfaction of the Sessions Judge and the sureties were\nalso directed to produce their title deeds before the\ncourt at the time of executing the bond. The aforesaid\norder was passed on 21.06.2016.\n\n2016/KER/33887\n\nCri. M.C. No.4781 of 2016 2\n\n3.The petitioner immediately approached this Court and\nfiled Cril.M.C. No.4501 of 2016 with a prayer to permit\nhim to deposit the bond amount in cash. According to\nhim, he was not in a position to produce solvent\nsureties to the satisfaction of the court below. The\naforesaid application was disposed of on 19.7.2016\ndirecting the petitioner to file an application before the\ncourt below.\n\n4.It appears that even prior to passing of Annexure C\norder the petitioner had approached the learned\nSessions Judge and had sought for the same relief, but\nhis prayer was rejected by Annexure C order dated\n13.7.2016 on the ground that there is every chance for\nabsconding.\n\n5. Heard the learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner\nas well as learned Public Prosecutor.\n\n6.The learned Counsel would submit that Section 445 of\nthe Code specifically enables the accused to deposit\n\n2016/KER/33887\n\nCri. M.C. No.4781 of 2016 3\ncash in circumstances where the sureties may not be\navailable. It is asserted that he was arrested on\n23.4.2016 and has not been able to secure his release\nin spite of Annexure-A order which is dated 21.6.2016.\nThe learned counsel also submits that the petitioner has\na permanent place of abode in Tamil Nadu and the\ninvestigating officer was convinced of this fact. The\nlearned counsel also submits that he is prepared to\nexecute a bond with two sureties from his place of\nabode and also to deposit the bond amount. There is\nno chance for the petitioner evading from the process of\nlaw.\n\n7.The learned Public Prosecutor on the other hand\nopposed the submission and submits that the petitioner\nwill not be available for trial if sufficient safeguards are\nnot put in place.\n\n8.I have bestowed my anxious consideration to the rival\nsubmissions. I take note of the submission of the\n\na\nret\nBina\n2016/KER/33887\nCrl. M.C. No.4781 of 2016 4\nlearned counsel that the petitioner has amassed the\nbond amount to comply with the stipulations in Section\n445 of the Code. I am of the view that appropriate\nstringent conditions can be imposed to safeguard the\ninterest of the prosecution. The petitioner can also be\ndirected to produce two sureties who shall execute the\nbond to the satisfaction of the court.\n9.Having regard to the facts and_ circumstances,\nAnnexure-C order is set aside. The learned Sessions\nJudge is directed to release the petitioner on bail on the\npetitioner complying with the following conditions:\na. In substitution of the earlier bond\namount of Rs.1,00,000/-, the\npetitioner shall deposit a sum of\nRs.1,50,000/- and also execute a\nbond with two sureties.\nb. The petitioner as well his sureties\nshall produce authentic records to\nprove their residence and nativity in\nthe State of Tamil Nadu or elsewhere\nalong with proper identification cards\nto the satisfaction of the court below.\n\na\nret\nBina\n2016/KER/33887\nCrl. M.C. No.4781 of 2016 5\n\nc. If the learned Public Prosecutor\n\nentertains any doubt with regard to\n\nthe authenticity and genuineness of\n\nthe documents, he shall be at liberty\n\nto make enquiries through the\n\ninvestigating officer and to place a\n\nreport before the Sessions Judge.\n\nd. The learned Sessions Judge will be\n\nat liberty to cancel the bail, if any\n\ngranted, without referring the matter\n\nto this Court in accordance with law.\n\ne. All the other conditions imposed in\n\nAnnexure-A order shall remain as\n\nsuch.\n\nThe petition is disposed off.\nSd/-\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN V.\nJUDGE\nSKV\n\n"
