CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON\n11.01.2021, ALONG WITH Crl.MC.3800/2020(D), THE COURT ON THE\nSAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nop\nCrl.MC.3800/2020 & 2021/KER/1599\nCrl.MC.3806/2020 ;\nORDER\nThe petitioner in two Crl.M.Cs. viz., accused\nNo.1 and accused No.3, 8, 4 and 6 came up to quash\nAnnexure A9 complaint and Annexure A10 order taking\ncognizance for the offence under Section 420 r/w\nSection 34 IPC. What is alleged is based on the\nbreach of contract and obligation arising out of\nit. It was contended that the defacto complainant\nagreed to supply rock boulders for the project of\nVizhinjam International Sea Port and a letter of\nintent for supply of 84,00,000 MTS of rock boulders\nwithin 24 months was placed with the defacto\ncomplainant. It is alleged that defacto complainant\naccordingly arranged rock boulders to a\nconsiderable extent. They have also received part\npayment of Rs.2,75,00,000/- and Rs.1,85,00,000/-,\ntotalling Rs.4,60,00,000/-. But subsequently, the\ncontract was assigned to somebody else causing big\nloss to the complainant. The very nature of the\ncomplaint would prima facie show what is involved\nis a civil liability arising out of a concluded\n\nCrl.MC.3800/2020 & 2021/KER/1599\nCrl.MC.3806/2020 -\ncontract and its breach. The facts narrated and\nalleged would not constitute any delivery of\nproperty or detention of property either\nfraudulently or dishonestly under any deception or\ncause any damage by that means to the property or\nreputation of any person so as to attract the\ningredient which would constitute '‘'cheating' as\ndefined under Section 415 IPC. Hence it would be a\nfutile exercise if it is proceeded further. The\ncomplaint and the order taking cognizance against\nthe petitioners are hereby quashed.\nCrl.M.Cs. are allowed accordingly.\nSd/-\nP.
