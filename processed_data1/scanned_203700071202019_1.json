The petitioner was permitted to go abroad for a\nperiod of two years and his passport was released, thereafter\nhe sought extension of further period of six months which also\nwas allowed, but on expiry of that further period of six\nmonths, he did not surrender and his prayer for further\nextension of six months was disallowed by the court vide\nAnnexure A order. Thereafter, the petitioner surrendered his\npassport and sought further time of six months to go abroad\nwhich was disallowed by the court vide Annexure B order on\nthe ground that he committed default of not surrendering his\npassport after the extended period of six months. The co-\naccused have been allowed to go abroad vide Annexure C and\n\nCrl.MC.No.7120 OF 2019 (H) 3 2020/KERID9\nD orders. The petitioner submitted that he is employed\nabroad and his not reaching there on time will result in loosing\nof his employment and that the rules pertains to employment\nis very strict in Saudi Arabia, where he is employed. The\npetitioner did not appear on time, but nevertheless,\nsubsequently surrendered his passport. It is also pertinent to\nnote that he had applied for an extension of time, when he\ncould not appear within the stipulated time, but that was\ndisallowed by the court. The non-appearance of the\npetitioner does not appears to be a wanton act of breach.\n\nConsidering the fact that the trial has not yet began, I\nam of the opinion that the petitioner can be permitted to go\nabroad for a further period of four months on certain stringent\nconditions. He is directed to deposit a sum of Rs.one lakh\nbefore the trial court and in case he fails to appear before the\nstipulated time of four months, the said amount shall be\nforfeited. On these conditions, the passport of the petitioner\nshall be released for a period of four months from the date of\nrelease of the passport.\n\nSD/-\nASHOK MENON\nem JUDGE\n\nape eseA |\neae\nCrl.MC.No.7120 OF 2019 (H) 4 2020/KERID9\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE A TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER DATED,\n27.07.2019 IN CRL.M.P.NO.1761/2019 oF\nADDL.SESSIONS COURT-II, MANJERT.\nANNEXURE B TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER DATED,\n04.09.2019 IN CRL.M.P.NO.2073/2019 oF\nADDL.SESSIONS COURT-II, MANJERT.\nANNEXURE C TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER DATED,\n02.09.2019 IN CRL.M.P.NO.2042/2019 oF\nADDL.SESSIONS COURT-II, MANJERT.\nANNEXURE D TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER DATED,\n30.08.2019 IN CRL.M.P.NO.2009/2019 oF\nADDL.SESSIONS COURT-II, MANJERT.\n\n"
