He is facing prosecution for\nvarious offences, including Section 308 of the Indian Penal Code, i860.\nAfter the petitioner was granted bail, he failed to appear on 28.12.2023\nand therefore the learned Sessions Judge cancelled the bail and issued a\nnon-bailable warrant for his appearance.\n\n2. Sri.R.Sunil Kumar, the learned counsel for the petitioner\ncontended that though petitioner is willing to appear before the court and\nseek bail, he apprehends that he may be remanded to custody and hence\nhe seeks for a direction to consider his bail application and application to\nrecall the warrant on the same date.\n\n3. I have heard Smt.Sreeja V., the learned Public Prosecutor as\nwell.\n\n4. Considering the circumstances arising in the case, I am of the\nview that the request of the petitioner ought to be allowed.\n\n5. Accordingly, there will be a direction to the learned Sessions\nJudge to consider the bail application as well as the petition for recall of\nwarrant on the same day itself, provided such applications are filed by\npetitioner within ten days from today.
