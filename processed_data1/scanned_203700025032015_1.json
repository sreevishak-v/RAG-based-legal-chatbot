RAMAKRISHNAN, J.\nDated this the 24 day of April, 2015.\nORDER\n\nAccused 1 to 3 in Crime No.362/2015 of Anchalummoodu\npolice station have filed this petition seeking a direction to\nthe Magistrate under section 482 of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure.\n\n2. It is alleged in the petition that the first petitioner is\nworking in Army Headquarters in AIR SP SIG Unit, C/o. 56 APO\nand petitioners 2 and 3 are parents of the first petitioner.\nThe petitioners were implicated as accused 1 to 3 in Crime\nNo.362/2015 of Anchalummoodu police station, Kollam district\nalleging offences under sections 376, 506(ii) read with section\n34 ofthe Indian Penal Code and section 3(1)(x) of Scheduled\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act\n(hereinafter referred to as 'the SC and ST Act' for short), which\nwas registered on the basis of Annexure-Al complaint filed by\nthe 4\" respondent before the Judicial First Class Magistrate\nCourt-I, Kollam, which was forwarded to the police for\ninvestigation under section 156(3) of the Code. As per\n\n2015/KER/17320\nCrl.M.C.No.2503 of 2015 2\nAnnexures-A2 to A5 produced by the petitioners, the allegations\nmade cannot be true and they have been falsely implicated in\nthe case. In view of the bar under section 18 of the SC and ST\nAct, anticipatory bail cannot be obtained in cases where the\nallegation of commission of offence under that Act has been\nalleged. So the petitioners have no other remedy except to\napproach this Court seeking the following relief:\n“For the above reasons and other valid grounds that are\n\nto be urged at the time of hearing it is most humbly prayed in\n\nthe interest of justice that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased\n\nto direct the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kollam to\n\nrelease the petitioners on bail in case of their surrender before\n\nthe Court in Annexure-Al complaint in Crime No.362/2015 of\n\nAnchalummoodu Police Station in the light of Annexure-A6\n\njudgment and the decision rendered by this Hon'ble Court in\n\n2003(3) KLT 452 in Shanu v. State of Kerala”.\n\n3. Considering the nature of relief claimed, this Court felt\nthat the petition can be disposed of after hearing the counsel\nfor the petitioners and learned Public Prosecutor appearing for\nrespondents 1 to 3 and dispensing with notice to the fourth\nrespondent.\n\n4. The counsel for the petitioners submitted that in view of\n\nEan ene\n2015/KER/17320\n\nCrl.M.C.No.2503 of 2015 3\nthe dictum laid down in Shanu v. State of Kerala (2000 (3)\nKLT 452), the Magistrate has got power to grant bail even if\noffence under the SC and ST Act has been incorporated. The\nlearned counsel has relied on Annexure-A6 order of this Court\nin a similar matter.\n\n5. The application was opposed by the Public Prosecutor.\n\n6. It is admitted in the petition itself that on the basis of\nAnnexure-Al private complaint filed by the 4\" respondent\nbefore the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kollam,\nwhich was forwarded to the police for investigation by the\nlearned Magistrate under section 156(3) of the Code, Crime\nNo.362/2015 of Anchalummoodu police station of Kollam\ndistrict was registered against the petitioners alleging\noffences under sections 376, 506(ii) read with section 34 of\nthe Indian Penal Code and Section 3(1)(x) of SC and ST Act\nand investigation is in progress. Section 18 of the SC and ST\nAct bars grating anticipatory bail under section 438 of the\nCode in a case where allegation of commission of offence\nunder the said Act has been alleged. But, that will not bea\nground for the petitioners to move this Court directing the\nmagistrate to grant bail or directing the petitioners to surrender\n\nBae\n2015/KER/17320\n\nCrl.M.C.No.2503 of 2015 4\n\nbefore the investigating officer and directing the investigating\nofficer to deal with the petitioners in accordance with law. It\n\nis true that in the decision reported in Shanu's case (cited\nsupra), it has been observed that merely because offence under\nthe SC and ST Act has been incorporated, that will not interdict\nthe power of the magistrate in appropriate cases to consider\nthe bail application if any filed and grant bail to accused\npersons, if they surrender before that court. The nature of\noffence mentioned in Annexure-A6 is different from the offence\nmentioned in this case. Further, this Court feels that the\npetition can be disposed of as follows:\n\nIf the petitioners surrender before the Judicial First\nClass Magistrate Court,-I, Kollam and move for bail in Crime\nNo.362/2015 of Anchalummoodu police station, then the learned\nMagistrate is directed to consider and dispose of the bail\napplication in accordance with law taking into consideration the\nprinciple laid down in Shanu's case (cited supra) and also the\nnature of offences alleged after hearing the Assistant Public\nProsecutor of that court on the date of filing ofthe application\nitself as far as possible in accordance with law.\n\nWith the above directions and observations, this petition is\n\nEr aise\n2015/KER/17320\nCrl.M.C.No.2503 of 2015 5\ndisposed of.\nOffice is directed to communicate a copy of this order to\n\nthe concerned court immediately.\n\nSd/-\n\nK.
