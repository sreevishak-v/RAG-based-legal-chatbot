The\ncomplaint was laid and crime was registered for\noffences punishable under Sections 452, 354, 323,\n\nBueee\n2016/KER/42215\n\nCri.M.C. Nos. 5826, 5835 & 5838 of 2016 ob:\n324, 427 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal\nCode.\n\n3. In Criminal Miscellaneous Case No.5838 of\n2016, the 2\"? accused in Crime No.863 of 2016 is the\nde facto complainant. Her case is that on\n16.05.2016, at about 9.15 pm, the accused herein\nattempted to damage a car parked near the residence\nof the de facto complainant and attempted to beat\nthe de facto complainant using an iron rod. The 2\"\nand 3™ accused had hit with an iron rod causing\nbodily injuries to him and his brother. The crime\nwas registered against three persons, who are the\naccused herein. In the nature of the allegations\nraised in these cases, it is clear that they are\ncase and counter case.\n\n4. In Criminal Miscellaneous Case No.5826 of\n\nBueee\n2016/KER/42215\n\nCri.M.C. Nos. 5826, 5835 & 5838 of 2016 3;\n2016, the 1°* accused in Crime No.864 of 2016 is the\nsole accused. The de facto complainant therein is\nthe complainant in Crime No.864 of 2016. The\nallegation of the de facto complainant therein is\nthat on 11.03.2016, at about 10.3@ pm the accused\ntrespassed into the residential house of the de\nfacto complainant, abused him and pushed him down,\nto the verandha, tore his shirt and assaulted him.\nIt is alleged that some household articles were\nalso damaged. On the basis of the complaint lodged,\ncrime was registered and after investigation final\nreport was laid and the matter is pending as C.C.\nNo.738 of 2016.\n\n5. The respective accused in all the three\ncases have approached this Court with these cases\ncontending that the dispute between the parties have\n\nBupe\n2016/KER/42215\n\nCri.M.C. Nos. 5826, 5835 & 5838 of 2016 as\n\nbeen resolved amicably and voluntarily. The\naffidavits filed by the respective de _ facto\ncomplainants and the victims have been filed in each\n\nof the above case. The learned counsel for the de\nfacto complainant in the respective cases, relying\n\non the affidavits filed by the aggrieved persons,\ncontended that they indicate the true and correct\nfacts and reiterated the averments in_- the\naffidavits. It was contended that they do not intend\n\nto pursue the respective cases.\n\n6. The learned Public Prosecutor on\ninstructions submitted that the parties are not\ninvolved in any other crime and that parties have\nresolved their disputes. Having heard the learned\ncounsel for the respective petitioners and the\nrespondents and the learned Public Prosecutor, I am\n\napi\n2016/KER/42215\nCri.M.C. Nos. 5826, 5835 & 5838 of 2016\n-: 55-\n\nsatisfied that the parties have resolved their\ndisputes. In the interest of justice, a premature\ntermination of the entire proceedings is warranted.\nHence I am inclined to invoke Section 482 of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and quash the\nentire proceedings.\n\nIn the result, all the Criminal Miscellaneous\nCases are allowed and Crime Nos.738 of 2016, 863 of\n2016 and 864 of 2016 of Paravoor Police Station will\nstand quashed.\n\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS,\nJUDGE\nDST\n//True copy//\nP.A.
