CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n\n11.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nPee\n2024/KER/2390\nCrl.M.C.No.189 of 2024\n3:\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.\nDated this the 11\" day of January, 2024\nORDER\n\nPetitioners are facing indictment for the offence under Sections 279,\n341, 332, 356 and 294(b) read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code,\n1860, in C.C.No.262/2020 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate\nCourt, Chavakkad, which arose from Crime No.660/2019 of Chavakkad\nPolice Station. They challenge the final report filed in the above case.\n\n2. According to the prosecution, the defacto complainant who is the\ndriver of a KSRTC bus was wrongfully restrained and assaulted by the\npetitioners on 29.10.2019 and thereby committed the offences alleged.\n\n3. Sri. A. G. Viswambharan, the learned counsel for the petitioners\ncontended that the prosecution allegations do not make out any of the\noffences alleged and that the imputations against the petitioners are\nhighly improbable. It is also alleged that the allegations are manifestly\nattended with malafides and therefore, the jurisdiction of this Court under\nSection 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, can be invoked as\nheld in the decision in State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal [1992 Supp (1)\nSCC 335]. Apart from the above, the learned counsel also asserted that\nthe complaint was initiated by the defacto complainant only for the\npurpose of overcoming departmental action against him for his criminal\n\nPee\n2024/KER/2390\nCrl.M.C.No.189 of 2024\n4:\nbehavior and the victims of the incident are being arrayed as accused.\n\n4. Smt. Sreeja. V, the learned Public Prosecutor on the other hand\nsubmitted that the nature of allegations as revealed from Annexure-Al\nfinal report indicates that the same can be appreciated only after trial and\nthat Section 482 of Cr.P.C. cannot be invoked.\n\n5. The prosecution alleges that, on 29.10.2019, the accused, who\nwere travelling in a car blocked the KSRTC bus driven by the defacto\ncomplainant for not having given way for the car. Thereafter the accused\nopened the diver’s door of the bus and assaulted the defacto complainant\nand attempted to pulled him down after abusing him and thereby\ncommitted the offences alleged. Though the learned counsel for the\npetitioner vehemently contended about the alleged falsity of the crime, |\nam of the view that, these are all matters for appreciation after due trial\nand the jurisdiction under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. cannot be availed to\nquash the proceedings. Further, if in case, the allegations raised against\nthe petitioners are not made out from the materials collected by the\ninvestigation, petitioners will have to approach the _ jurisdictional\nMagistrate seeking discharge. The inherent powers of this Court under\nSection 482 of the Cr.P.C. cannot be invoked in a case of this nature.\n\nAccordingly, | find no merit in the Criminal Miscellaneous Case and it\nis dismissed.\n\nSd/-\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\nJka/11.01.24.\n\neee\n2024/KER/2390\nCrl.M.C.No.189 of 2024\n-51-\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 189/2024\n\nPETITIONERS’ ANNEXURES\nAnnexure Az A CERTIFIED TRUE COPY OF THE FINAL CHARGE\n\nIN CC NO 262/2020 OF JUDICIAL FIRST CLASS\n\nMAGISTRATE COURT, CHAVAKKAD DATED\n\n18.12.2020.\n\n"
