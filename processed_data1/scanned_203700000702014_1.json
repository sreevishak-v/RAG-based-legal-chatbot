The’ petitioner stands accused of having\ncommitted the offences punishable under Sections 342 and\n324 of IPC.\n\n3. It is unnecessary to go into the facts and details of\nthe case for the simple reason that the petitioner has\nimpleaded the defacto complaint/victim as _ the first\nrespondent who has entered appearance through a counsel\nand the learned counsel appearing for the second\nrespondent has accepted that the affidavit filed along with\nthis petition is one sworn to by the first respondent herself\n\nBh\nEnts\nape\n2014/KER/235\nCrI.M.C.

It is also pointed out in the affidavit that the\ndefacto complainant is not interested in prosecuting the\nmatter further.\n\n5. In the light of the stand taken by the defacto\ncomplainant, it is felt that continuance of the proceedings\nwill only be an exercise in futility.\n\nHence, this petition is allowed.
