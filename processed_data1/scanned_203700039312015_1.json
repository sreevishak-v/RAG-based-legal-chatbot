CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON\n08.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\na\nCrl1.MC.No.3931 OF 2015 2 202 UKER/1227\nORDER\nDated this the 8th day of January 2021\n\nThe petitioner is the 2™* accused in C.P No.10/2015 on the\nfile of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court II, Neyyattinkara.\nThe above case is taken on file by the learned Magistrate for the\noffences under Sections 294(b), 323, 324 r/w Section 34 IPC and\nSection 3(1)(x) of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe\n(Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (for short 'the SC/ST Act').\n\n2. The prosecution case is that on 11.11.2014 at 11.15\nam, the accused in furtherance of common intention attacked the\ninformant with stick and called the caste name of the informant\nand thereby the accused committed the offences alleged. The\nincident in this case was happened on 11.11.2014. Annexure I\nFIR is registered alleging the offences punishable under Sections\n323 and 324 r/w 34 IPC. Subsequently, after investigation the\nfinal report is filed in which the offences under Sections 294(b),\n323 and 324 r/w 34 IPC and Section 3(1)(x) of the SC/ST Act are\nalso alleged. This Crl.M.C is filed to quash the entire\nproceedings in C.P No.10/2015 pending before the committal\ncourt.\n\na\nCrl.MC.No.3931 OF 2015 3 202UKER/I227\n\n3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, the\ncounsel for the 2™* respondent and the learned Public\nProsecutor.\n\n4. The counsel for the petitioner submitted that even if\nthe entire allegations are accepted, the offence under Section\n3(1)(x) of the SC/ST Act is not attracted in this case.\nAccording to the counsel, the basic ingredients of Section 3(1)\n(x) of SC/ST Act is not there evenif the entire allegations in\nAnnexure 2 final report is accepted. The counsel also\nsubmitted that the allegations in Annexure 2 final report is\nthat the incident happened in connection with a property\ndispute. According to the counsel, in such situation, in the\nlight of the Apex Court judgment in Hitesh Verma v. State of\nUttarakhand and others (AIR 2020 SC 5584), the\nprosecution against the petitioner is unsustainable. The\ncounsel submitted that this is a false case foisted against the\npetitioner and hence the offences under Sections 294(b), 323\nand 324 r/w 34 IPC is not prima facie made out. The counsel\nalso submitted that to attract the offence under Section 3(1)(x)\nof the SC/ST Act, the prosecution has to establish that\nwhoever not being a member of a Scheduled caste or\nScheduled Tribe intentionally abuse a member of a Scheduled\n\na\nCr1.MC.No.3931 OF 2015 4 202 UKER/1227\nCaste or Scheduled Tribe by caste name in any place within\npublic view. According to the counsel, as per Annexure 2 final\nreport, the caste name which is alleged to be mentioned by the\naccused is \"alo@a@ cadIom\". But it is an admitted case that the\ncaste name of the defacto complainant is “Sambava”.\n\n5. The counsel for the 2\"? respondent submitted that\nthis petition under Section 482 Cr.PC may not be entertained\nfor the simple reason that this is a matter of evidence.\nAccording to the counsel, there is specific averments in the\nfinal report to the effect that the petitioner committed the\noffence under Section 3(1)(x) of the SC/ST Act. The counsel\nsubmitted that, if there is specific averments in the final\nreport, this Court cannot quash the proceedings invoking the\npowers under Sections 482 CrPC because it is a matter of\nevidence. The counsel relied the judgment of the Apex Court\nin Devendra Prasad Singh v. State of Bihar and another\n[(2019) 4 SCC 351], in which it is stated that the High Court\nhas no jurisdiction to appreciate the statement of witnesses\nand record a finding that there are inconsistencies in their\nstatement while exercising the power under Section 482 Cr.P.C\nto quash criminal proceedings. The counsel also relied the\n\na\n\nCrl.MC.No.3931 OF 2015 5 202UKER/I227\njudgment of the Apex Court in Mohammed Alauddin Khan\nv. State of Bihar (2019(6) SCC 107) in which it is stated\nthat the criminal proceedings cannot be quashed on the\nground that there is civil dispute. According to the counsel,\nthe name 'Sambava' is usually called to the persons in the\nlower caste and it is an insult if a person called like that. This\nis a matter of evidence. The counsel submitted that the\ndefacto complainant was seriously assaulted by the petitioner\nand they sustained injuries also. From that itself, the intention\nof the petitioner is clear. The sum and substance of the\nsubmission of the 2\" respondent is that the contention raised\nby the petitioner is to be decided in a trial and this Court\ncannot consider the same in a petition under Section 482\nCr.PC.\n\n6. A perusal of Annexure 2 final report will show that\nthe offences alleged against the petitioner and others are\nunder Sections 294(b), 323 and 324 r/w 34 IPC and Section\n3(1)(x) of SC/ST Act. As far as Section 294(b), 323 and 324\nr/w 34 of IPC is concerned, there are specific averments in the\nfinal report. This Court cannot quash the proceedings against\nthe petitioner for the offences under Sections 294(b), 323 and\n324 r/w 34 IPC. This is a matter of evidence which is to be\n\neller\nBee\nCrl.MC.No.3931 OF 2015 6 2021/KER/1227\nproved before the trial court.\n\n7. As far as Section 3(1)(x) of SC/ST Act is concerned,\nthe point to be decided is whether the offences is prima facie\nmade out in this case. Section 3(1)(x) of SC/ST Act is\nextracted hereunder:\n\n“3. Punishments for offences of atrocities —\n(1) Whoever, not being a member of a Scheduled Caste or\nScheduled Tribe-\nXXXXK\nXXXXX\nXXXXX\n(x) intentionally insults or intimidates with intent\nto humiliate a member of a Scheduled Caste or a\nScheduled Tribe in any place within public view;\nshall be punishable with imprisonment for a term\nwhich shall not be less than six months but which\nmay extend to five years and with fine.”\n\n8. The Apex Court considered the ingredients of the\nabove offence in Hitesh Verma's case (supra). The relevant\nportion of the judgment of the Apex Court is extracted\nhereunder:\n\n“8. Against the backdrop of these facts, it is\npertinent to refer to the Statement of Objects\nand Reasons of enactment of the Act. It is\nprovided as under:\n\nDespite various measures to improve the\nsocioeconomic conditions of the Scheduled\nCastes and the Scheduled Tribes, they remain\nvulnerable. They are denied number of civil\nrights. They are subjected to various offences,\n\nBae\nCr1.MC.No.3931 OF 2015 7 2021/KER/1227\nindignities, humiliations and harassment.\nThey have, in several brutal incidents, been\ndeprived of their life and property. Serious\ncrimes are committed against them for\nvarious historical, social and economic\nreasons.\n2. Because of the awareness created amongst\nthe Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled\nTribes through spread of education, etc., they\nare trying to assert their rights and this is not\nbeing taken very kindly by the others. When\nthey assert their rights and resist practices of\nuntouchability against them or demand\nstatutory minimum wages or refuse to do any\nbonded and forced labour, the vested interests\ntry to cow them down and terrorise them.\nWhen the Scheduled Castes and _ the\nScheduled Tribes try to preserve their self\nrespect or honour of their women, they\nbecome irritants for the dominant and the\nmighty. Occupation and cultivation of even the\nGovernment allotted land by the Scheduled\nCastes and the Scheduled Tribes is resented\nand more often these people become victims\nof attacks by the vested interests. Of late,\nthere has been an increase in the disturbing\ntrend of commission of certain atrocities like\nmaking the Scheduled Caste persons eat\ninedible substances like human excreta and\nattacks on and mass killings of helpless\nScheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes\nand rape of women belonging to the\nScheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.\nUnder the circumstances, the existing laws\nlike the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955\nand the normal provisions of the Indian Penal\nCode have been found to be inadequate to\ncheck these crimes. A special Legislation to\ncheck and deter crimes against them\ncommitted by non-Scheduled Castes and non-\nScheduled Tribes has, therefore, become\nnecessary.\n9. The long title of the Act is to prevent the\ncommission of offences of atrocities against the\nmembers of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled\n\nBaas\nCr1.MC.No.3931 OF 2015 8 2021/KER/1227\nTribes, to provide for Special Courts and Exclusive\nSpecial Courts for the trial of such offences and for\nthe relief and rehabilitation of the victims of such\noffences and for matters connected therewith or\nincidental thereto.\n10. The Act was enacted to improve the social\neconomic conditions of the vulnerable Sections of\nthe society as they have been subjected to various\noffences such as indignities, humiliations and\nharassment. They have been deprived of life and\nproperty as well. The object of the Act is thus to\npunish the violators who inflict indignities,\nhumiliations and harassment and commit the\noffence as defined Under Section 3 of the Act. The\nAct is thus intended to punish the acts of the upper\ncaste against the vulnerable Section of the society\nfor the reason that they belong to a particular\ncommunity.\n11. It may be stated that the charge-sheet filed is\nfor an offence Under Section 3(1)(x) of the Act. The\nsaid Section stands substituted by Act No. 1 of 2016\nw.e.f. 26.1.2016. The substituted corresponding\nprovision is Section 3(1)(r) which reads as under:\n3(1)(r) intentionally insults or intimidates with\nintent to humiliate a member of a Scheduled\nCaste or a Scheduled Tribe in any place\nwithin public view;\n12. The basic ingredients of the offence Under\nSection 3(1)(r) of the Act can be classified as \"1)\nintentionally insults or intimidates with intent to\nhumiliate a member of a Scheduled Caste or a\nScheduled Tribe and 2) in any place within public\nview\".\n13. The offence Under Section 3(1)(r) of the Act\nwould indicate the ingredient of intentional insult\nand intimidation with an intent to humiliate a\nmember of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe.\nAll insults or intimidations to a person will not be an\noffence under the Act unless such insult or\nintimidation is on account of victim belonging to\nScheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe. The object of\nthe Act is to improve the socio-economic conditions\n\nBae\nCr1.MC.No.3931 OF 2015 9 2021/KER/1227\nof the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes\nas they are denied number of civil rights. Thus, an\noffence under the Act would be made out when a\nmember of the vulnerable Section of the Society is\nsubjected to indignities, humiliations and\nharassment. The assertion of title over the land by\neither of the parties is not due to either the\nindignities, humiliations or harassment. Every\ncitizen has a right to avail their remedies in\naccordance with law. Therefore, if the Appellant or\nhis family members have invoked jurisdiction of the\ncivil court, or that Respondent No. 2 has invoked the\njurisdiction of the civil court, then the parties are\navailing their remedies in accordance with the\nprocedure established by law. Such action is not for\nthe reason that Respondent No. 2 is member of\nScheduled Caste.\n14. Another key ingredient of the provision is insult\nor intimidation in \"any place within public view\".\nWhat is to be regarded as \"place in public view\" had\ncome up for consideration before this Court in the\njudgment reported as Swaran Singh and Ors. v.\nState through Standing Counsel and Ors.\nMANDU/SC/7954/2008 : (2008) 8 SCC 435. The\nCourt had drawn distinction between the expression\n\"public place\" and \"in any place within public view\".\nIt was held that if an offence is committed outside\nthe building e.g. in a lawn outside a house, and the\nlawn can be seen by someone from the road or lane\noutside the boundary wall, then the lawn would\ncertainly be a place within the public view. On the\ncontrary, if the remark is made inside a building,\nbut some members of the public are there (not\nmerely relatives or friends) then it would not be an\noffence since it is not in the public view. The Court\nheld as under:\n28. It has been alleged in the FIR that\nVinod Nagar, the first informant, was\ninsulted by Appellants 2 and 3 (by calling\nhim a \"chamar\") when he stood near the car\nwhich was parked at the gate of the\npremises. In our opinion, this was certainly a\nplace within public view, since the gate ofa\nhouse is certainly a place within public view.\n\nBae\nCr1.MC.No.3931 OF 2015 10 2021/KER/1227\nIt could have been a different matter had the\nalleged offence been committed inside a\nbuilding, and also was not in the public view.\nHowever, if the offence is committed outside\nthe building e.g. in a lawn outside a house,\nand the lawn can be seen by someone from\nthe road or lane outside the boundary wall,\nthe lawn would certainly be a place within\nthe public view. Also, even if the remark is\nmade inside a building, but some members\nof the public are there (not merely relatives\nor friends) then also it would be an offence\nsince it is in the public view. We must,\ntherefore, not confuse the expression \"place\nwithin public view\" with the expression\n“public place\". A place can be a private place\nbut yet within the public view. On the other\nhand, a public place would ordinarily mean a\nplace which is owned or leased by the\nGovernment or the municipality (or other\nlocal body) or gaon sabha or an\ninstrumentality of the State, and not by\nprivate persons or private bodies.\n15. As per the FIR, the allegations of abusing the\ninformant were within the four walls of her building.\nIt is not the case of the informant that there was any\nmember of the public (not merely relatives or\nfriends) at the time of the incident in the house.\nTherefore, the basic ingredient that the words were\nuttered \"in any place within public view\" is not made\nout. In the list of witnesses appended to the charge-\nsheet, certain witnesses are named but it could not\nbe said that those were the persons present within\nthe four walls of the building. The offence is alleged\nto have taken place within the four walls of the\nbuilding. Therefore, in view of the judgment of this\nCourt in Swaran Singh, it cannot be said to be a\nplace within public view as none was said to be\npresent within the four walls of the building as per\nthe FIR and/or charge-sheet.\n16. There is a dispute about the possession of the\nland which is the subject matter of civil dispute\nbetween the parties as per Respondent No. 2\nherself. Due to dispute, Appellant and others were\nnot permitting Respondent No. 2 to cultivate the\n\nBIRR esi\nBases\nCr1.MC.No.3931 OF 2015 11 2021/KER/1227\nland for the last six months. Since the matter is\nregarding possession of property pending before the\nCivil Court, any dispute arising on account of\npossession of the said property would not disclose\nan offence under the Act unless the victim is abused,\nintimated or harassed only for the reason that she\nbelongs to Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe.”\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n9. In the light of the above judgment of the Apex\nCourt, the basic ingredients of the offence under Section 3(1)\n(x) of the SC/ST Act is as follows:\n\n‘“1) Intentionally insults or intimidates.\n\nii) This should be with intent to humiliate a member of\na Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe in any place\nwithin public view.”\n\n10. It is an admitted fact that the caste of the defacto\ncomplainant in this case is Sambava. A perusal of the final\nreport will show that the allegation in the final report is that\nthe petitioner called the defacto complainant in the following\nmanner:\n\n\"aQS) AMOR erIaM OEMs) Mlaan &d6Mlaj Meas\"\n\n11. “Parayan” is a separate caste, of course, this caste\nalso is a scheduled caste. A perusal of Section 3(1)(x) of the\nSC/ST Act will show that, to attract the offence, a person not\nbeing a member of a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe\nshould intentionally insults or intimidates with intent to\n\na\nCr1.MC.No.3931 OF 2015 12 2021/KER/1227\nhumiliate a member of a Scheduled caste or Scheduled Tribe\nin any place within public view. Therefore, the main\ningredients to attract the offence is intentionally insults or\nintimidate with intent to humiliate a member of a Scheduled\nCaste or a Scheduled Tribe. The admitted case is that there\nwas some property dispute between the families of the\npetitioner and the defacto complainant. That is the motive\nalleged in this case. A reading of Annexure 2 final report will\nshow that the intention of the petitioner is to assault the\naccused and not to insult or intimidate him because he belongs\nto Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe. This conclusion is\nstrengthened because the first information statement in this\ncase was given by the 2™ respondent after about four days\nfrom the date of incident. The alleged incident happened on\n11.11.2014 and the first information statement which is a\nsigned statement was given on 15.11.2014. When the first\ninformation statement was given, the 2\" respondent has no\ncase that the petitioner intentionally insults or intimidate him\nwith intent to humiliate him because he belongs to Scheduled\nCaste or Scheduled Tribe. If that is the case, according to me,\nprima facie Section 3(1)(x) of the SC/ST Act is not attracted.\nTherefore, according to me, the continuation of the\n\nBIRR hal\nBae\nCrl.MC.No.3931 OF 2015 13 2021/KER/1227\n\nproceedings against the petitioner under Section 3(1)(x) of the\nSC/ST Act is an abuse of process of law. But I make it clear\nthat the offence under Section 294(b), 323 and 324 r/w 34 IPC\nis prima facie made out in this case. The petitioner has to face\ntrial before the lower court for the same in accordance to law.\nThe trial court will conduct the trial untramelled by any\nobservation in this case. Therefore, this Criminal\nMiscellaneous case is allowed in part.\n\nI) The prosecution against the petitioner under\nSection 3(1)(x) of SC/ST Act based on\nAnnexure 2 final report is quashed.\n\nii) The prosecution under Sections 294(b), 323 and\n324 r/w 34 IPC will sustain and the lower court\nwill proceed with the trial in accordance to law.\n\niii) What remains now is only an offence triable by the\nMagistrate Court. Therefore, the learned\nMagistrate will try to dispose of the case as\nexpeditiously as possible.\n\nSd/-\nP.V.KUNHIKRISHNAN\nJUDGE\nab\n\nBIR eel\nBiz aH\nCrl.MC.No.3931 OF 2015 14 202U/KER/1227\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE P1 COPY OF THE FIRST INFORMATION REPORT\nALONG WITH FIRST INFORMATION STATEMENT\nIN CRIME NO 1425/14 OF PARASALA POLICE\nSTATION\nANNEXURE IT CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT IN\nCRIME NO 1425/2014 OF PARASALA POLICE\nSTATION\nRESPONDENTS EXHIBITS: NIL\n//TRUE COPY//\nP.A TO JUDGE\nab\n\n"
