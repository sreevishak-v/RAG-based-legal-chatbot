KEMAL PASHA, J.\nDated this the 4\" day of January, 2018\nORDER\n\nPetitioner is the accused in CC No.627/2015 of\nthe Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-ll, Ernakulam,\nbased on Annexure-B final report in Crime No.2536/2014 of\nErnakulam Central Police Station for the offence punishable\nunder Section 135(1)(e) of the Indian Electricity Act\n(Amendment) 2003. The allegation against the petitioner is\nthat he has made use of the electricity obtained by him in a\ndomestic connection for commercial purpose, thereby\ncausing wrongful loss of %40,740/- to the Kerala State\n\nElectricity Board.\n2. It has come out that the entire amount of\n~40,740/- has been paid by the petitioner. The petitioner\n\nree\nape\n2018/KER/237\nCrl.M.C.867/2016\n:2:\nhad approached the Kerala State Electricity Appellate\nAuthority and filed an appeal against the action initiated by\nthe KSEB against him. By Annexure-C order, the\nproceedings initiated against the petitioner through the final\nassessment order dated 06.12.2014, was set aside by the\nAppellate Authority. In Annexure-C order, the Appellate\nAuthority has observed thai-\n“The action of the appellant would have\nfallen under dishonest intention, if a higher tariff\nelectric connection existed in this premises. No\ncase of any tampering of meter has been\nrecorded in the site mahazar. The allegation of\ndishonest intention against the appellant has not\nbeen established by the respondent either in the\nsite mahazar or through any other evidence.\nHence, the action of the appellant is not falling\nunder the purview of Section 135 of Electricity\nAct 2003 (amended in 2007) and the action\ntaken by the respondent is quite unfair and\nunsustainable.”\n3. According to the learned Standing Counsel for\n\n2018/KER/237\n\nCrl.M.C.867/2016 4.\n\nthe KSEB, Annexure-C proceedings are independent\nproceedings and it cannot have any bearing on the criminal\naction relating to the offence committed. At the same time,\nit seems that through Annexure-C order, the Appellate\nAuthority has found that no offence has been made out\nunder Section 135 of the Indian Electricity Act. The Appellate\nAuthority has in categorical terms declared that there was\nno dishonest intention on the part of the petitioner in making\nuse of the said electricity connection for commercial\npurpose. When the Appellate Authority of the Kerala State\nElectricity Board itself has found that there are no elements\nto invite an offence under Section 135 of the Indian\nElectricity Act, and especially when the amount assessed\nhas been paid by the petitioner, the continued prosecution\nwill not yield any fruitful result. Matters being so, all further\nproceedings against the petitioner in CC No.627/2015 of the\nJudicial First Class Magistrate's Court-ll, Ernakulam, which\nhas arisen from Crime No.2536/2014 of Ernakulam Central\n\nree\nseat Cea 4\naR\n2018/KER/237\nCrl.M.C.867/2016\n4:\nPolice Station, can be quashed.\n\nIn the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and all further\nproceedings against the petitioner in CC No.627/2015 of the\nJudicial First Class Magistrate's Court-ll, Ernakulam, which\nhas arisen from Crime No.2536/2014 of Ernakulam Central\nPolice Station, are quashed.\n\nSd/-\n(B.KEMAL PASHA, JUDGE)\naks/04/01\n// True Copy //\nPS to Judge\n\n"
