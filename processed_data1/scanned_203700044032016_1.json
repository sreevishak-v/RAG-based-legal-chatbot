The aforesaid case has arisen from\nCrime No.391 of 2010 of the Malappuram Police Station\nregistered for offence punishable under Sections 143,\n147, 148, 447, 341, 323, 324, 427 read with Section 34\nof the Indian Penal Code.\n2.After investigation, final report was laid before the\njurisdictional Magistrate and the case was initially taken\nfor cognizance as C.C. No. 1440 of 2011. The petitioner\nis arrayed as the 2™ accused in the aforesaid charge.\nThe case was proceeded with and as per Annexure B\njudgment dated 21.02.2015, the accused Nos. 1 and 3\nto 7 were found not guilty of the offence and they have\n\nnee\n2016/KER/33664\n\nCrl.M.C.No. 4403 of 2016 ;\nacquitted under Section 248(1) of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure.\n\n3.The case against the petitioner herein was split up and\nrefilled as C.C No. 283 of 2015. After the acquittal of\nthe other accused, the matter was amicably resolved\nbetween the parties and Annexure-C is the affidavit\nsworn to by the 2™ respondent/de facto complainant\nbefore this Court wherein, he asserts that the matter\nhas been settled and that he has no objection in\nterminating the criminal proceedings.\n\n4.1 have given my anxious considerations to the\nsubmissions made across the bar and I have also gone\nthrough the materials on record. Annexure B judgment,\nwhich records the acquittal of the co accused, reveals\nthat the de facto complainant had deposed before the\ncourt that the matter had been settled. PWs 2 and 3\nare the eye witnesses to the occurrence and they did\nnot support the prosecution case. Learned Magistrate\ncame to the conclusion that the evidence let in did not\nconnect the accused with the crime. These findings\n\nnee\n2016/KER/33664\n\nCrl.M.C.No. 4403 of 2016 ;\nentered into by the learned Magistrate would definitely\naffect the very substratum of the prosecution case. As\nheld by a three Judge Bench of this Court in Moosa V\nSub Inspector of Police (2006 (1) KLT 552), though\nthe reasoning of the judgment contained or appreciation\nof evidence in the case of a co-accused therein are not\ngrounds to attract any relief under Section 482 of the\nCode, a case where the substratum of the case is lost is\nan exception to the above rule.\n\n5.I am of the firm view that no purpose is going to be\nserved by directing the petitioner to face the trial at this\nstage. It can only be a futile exercise and the only\npurpose that will be served is to gnaw into precious\ntime during which more productive work can be done by\nthe court below. The prospects of conviction is\nextremely remote owing to the acquittal of the co\naccused.\n\nIn the result, this petition is allowed. The\nproceedings as against the petitioner who is the sole\naccused in C.C No. 283 of 2015 on the files of the\n\n2016/KER/33664\nCri.M.C.No. 4403 of 2016\n4\nJudicial First Class Magistrate Court, Malappuram shall\nstand quashed.\nSd/-RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.Y,\nJudge\n\nIsn\n\n"
