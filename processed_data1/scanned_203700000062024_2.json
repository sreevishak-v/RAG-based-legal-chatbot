Petitioners are accused Nos. 1 and 2 in C.P. No.14/2017 on the\nfiles of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-l, Nedumangad, arising out\nof Crime No.1684/2016 of Venjaramoodu Police station,\nThiruvananthapuram, registered for the offences under Sections 341,\n294(b), 323, 324 and 308 r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.\nSecond Respondent is the defacto complainant.\n\n3. According to the prosecution, the accused had, assaulted the\ndefacto complainant and attacked him with an iron rod and thereby\ncommitted the offences alleged.\n\n4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned\ncounsel for the respondent, apart from the learned Public Prosecutor.\n\n5. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the matter\nhas been settled and hence the proceedings against the petitioners ought\nto be quashed. It was also submitted that, considering the nature of\noffences alleged, no purpose would be served by continuing the\n\n2024/KER/4460\nCrl.M.C.No.6 of 2024\n4:\nproceedings.\n\n6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and Another [(2012) 10 SCC\n303], the Apex Court has held that in appropriate cases, the High Court\ncan take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim\nand the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. This view\nwas reiterated in Narinder Singh and Others v. State of Punjab and\nAnother [(2014) 6 SCC 466] and Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State\nof Jharkhand and Another [(2014) 9 SCC 653].\n\n7. | have perused Annexure-A3 affidavit filed by the second\nrespondent. The learned Public Prosecutor has submitted that upon\nverification, it is understood that the affidavit is genuine, and the defacto\ncomplainant stands by the contents thereof. | am satisfied that the matter\nhas been settled and no public interest is involved in this case. There is no\nimpediment for granting the prayer for quashing. The continuance of the\nproceedings will only be an exercise in futility.\n\n8. Accordingly, all proceedings against the petitioners in\nC.P. No.14/2017 on the files of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-l,\nNedumangad, are quashed.\n\nThis Crl.M.C is allowed as above.\n\nSd/-\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\nJka/18.01.24.\n\ncs\n2024/KER/4460\nCrl.M.C.No.6 of 2024\n-51-\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 6/2024\nPETITIONER’S ANNEXURES\nAnnexure Ai THE TRUE COPY OF THE FIR IN CRIME NO 1684\nOF 2016 OF VENJARAMOODU POLICE STATION.\nAnnexure A2 THE TRUE COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT IN CRIME\nNO 1684 OF 2016 OF VENJARAMOODU POLICE\nSTATION.\nAnnexure A3 THE AFFIDAVIT SWORN BY THE 2ND RESPONDENT\nDATED 22.12.2023.\n\n"
