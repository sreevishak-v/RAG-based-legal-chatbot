CASK HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON\n03.12.2019, THE COURT ON 06.01.2020 PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nrape\n2020/KER/172\nCr1.M.C.No.8437/2019\n2\nR.NARAYANA PISHARADI, J\n2K 2K 2K 2K 2K 2K 2K OK 2K OK 2K 2K OK 2K OK 2K 2K OK 2K 2K OK 2k ok kK\nCrl.M.C.No.8437 of 2019\nDated this the 6\" day of January, 2020\nORDER\n\nThe petitioners are the accused in the case\nC.C.No.460/2019 on the file of the Court of the Judicial First\nClass Magistrate-II, Mavelikkara.\n\n2. The offences alleged against the petitioners are\npunishable under Sections 57(a) and 56(b) of the Abkari Act,\n1077.\n\n3. The first petitioner is the Manager and the second\npetitioner is the licensee of the toddy shop No.24/2018-19 of the\nNooranad Excise Range. The Excise Inspector of Nooranad Excise\nRange took three samples of toddy from the aforesaid shop on\n08.12.2018. The samples were marked as 'A' sample, 'B' sample\nand 'C' sample. The chemical analysis of 'A' sample revealed that\n\napt\n2020/KER/172\n\nCr1.M.C.No.8437/2019 3\n\nthe said sample contained Sodium Lauryl Suphate, an adulterant.\nAnnexure-A is the copy of the certificate relating to the analysis\n\nof 'A' sample. On the basis of Annexure-A certificate, a case was\nregistered against the petitioners as C.R.No.11/2019 of the\nNooranad Excise Range.\n\n4. The 'B' sample was sent for chemical analysis at the\ninstance of the petitioners. It was sent through the court.\nAnnexure-B certificate of analysis in respect of the 'B' sample\nshows that no Sodium Lauryl Sulphate was detected in it.\n\n5. Even before the receipt of Annexure-B certificate,\nchargesheet against the petitioners was filed in the court for the\noffences mentioned above. Learned Magistrate has taken\ncognizance of the offences.\n\n6. This petition is filed under Section 482 CrP.C for\nquashing the proceedings against the petitioners which are based\non Annexure-C chargesheet.\n\n7. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the\nlearned Public Prosecutor.\n\napt\n2020/KER/172\nCr1.M.C.No.8437/2019 1\n\n8. Learned counsel for the petitioners contended that in\nview of the contradictory chemical analysis reports, the\nprosecution against the petitioners is liable to be quashed.\n\n9. Learned Public Prosecutor contended that the accused\nhad no right to get the second sample analysed and therefore,\nAnnexure-B certificate cannot be taken into consideration by the\ncourt.\n\n10. The question whether the accused had right to get the\nsecond sample sent for chemical analysis does not arise in this\ncase. The fact remains that the State did not challenge the order\nof the learned Magistrate allowing the application filed by the\npetitioners for sending the second sample for analysis.\n\n11. Annexure-C chargesheet against the petitioners was\nfiled in the court on 25.10.2019. Annexure-B report is dated\n28.10.2019. Annexure-C chargesheet was filed in the court even\nbefore the receipt of Annexure-B report. It means that there can\nbe nothing in the chargesheet which would enable the\nprosecution to challenge the correctness of Annexure-B report.\n\n.\napt\n2020/KER/172\n\nCr1.M.C.No.8437/2019 :\nIf the second report is in favour of the accused and if there is no\nmaterial in the final report to disprove or discredit the report in\nrespect of the second sample or if there is no challenge against\nthe report in respect of the second sample, then the final report\nis liable to be quashed. In view of Annexure-B certificate of\nanalysis, no successful prosecution can be sustained. Even if the\nprosecution is permitted to be continued, no purpose would be\nserved. Therefore, I am _ inclined to quash Annexure-C\nchargesheet and further proceedings against the petitioners\nbased on it.\n\n12. In the result, this petition is allowed. Annexure-C final\nreport laid in C.R.No.11/2019 of the Nooranad Excise Range and\nall further proceedings pursuant thereto, as against the\npetitioners, are hereby quashed.\n\n(sd/-)\nR.NARAYANA PISHARADI, JUDGE\njsr\n\nHi â€˜ iy\n2020/KER/172\nCr1.M.C.No. 8437/2019\n6\nAPPENDIX\n\nPETITIONERS'S EXHIBITS:\n\nANNEXURE A PHOTOCOPY OF THE CHEMICAL ANALYSIS\nCERTIFICATE DATED 19.12.2018 ISSUED BY\nTHE ASST.CHEMICAL EXAMINER TO GOVT OF\nKERALA, THIRUVANANTHAPURAM\n\nANNEXURE B PHOTOCOPY OF THE CHEMICAL ANALYSIS\nCERTIFICATE DATED 28.10.2019 ISSUED BY\nTHE ASST.CHEMICAL EXAMINER TO GOVT OF\nKERALA, THIRUVANANTHAPURAM\n\nANNEXURE C CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT IN\nCR.NO.11/2019 FILED BEFORE THE\nJUDL.FIRST CLASS MAGISTRATE COURT-II,\nMAVELIKKARA\n\nANNEXURE D PHOTOCOPY OF THE ORDER DATED 14.2.2013\nIN CRL.M.C.NO.769/2013 PASSED BY THIS\nHON'BLE COURT\n\nANNEXURE E PHOTOCOPY OF THE ORDER DATED 21.8.2014\nIN CRL.M.C.NO.3751/2014 PASSED BY THIS\nHON 'BLE COURT\n\nANNEXURE F PHOTOCOPY OF THE ORDER DATED 16.2.2016\nIN CRL.M.C.NO. 8055/2015 PASSED BY THIS\nHON 'BLE COURT\n\nANNEXURE G PHOTOCOPY OF THE ORDER DATED 02.2.2017\nIN CRL.M.C.NO.2060/2013 PASSED BY THIS\nHON 'BLE COURT\n\nRESONDENT'S EXHIBITS I NIL\n\nTRUE COPY\nPS TO JUDGE\n\n"
