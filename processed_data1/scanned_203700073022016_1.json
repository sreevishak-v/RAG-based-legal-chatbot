A. TO JUDGE\nPn\n\nBas]\n2017/KER/1238\nSUNIL THOMAS, J.\nDated this the 10\" day of January, 2017\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner is the sole accused in S.C. No.206/2016 of\nAdditional Sessions Court IV, Kottayam in Crime No.186/2012 of\nKottayam West Police Station for offences punishable under\nSections 143, 147, 148, 324, 326 & 307 read with 149 IPC. He\nstood charge sheeted along with the other accused in the above\ncrime. The petitioner herein was not available for trial. By\nAnnexure A3 judgment in SC No.219/2013 all other accused\nexcept the petitioner and another accused, who was arrayed as\nA5 and A6 were acquitted. The petitioner claims that he was in\nGulf country and was not aware of the proceedings, has\napproached this Court seeking to quash the proceedings on the\nground that the entire substratum of the case is lost and that he\nis entitled to the same benefit. Records reveal that by Annexure\nA3 judgment, other accused were acquitted holding that there\nwas absolutely no evidence to connect them with the incident.\n\n2. The learned Public Prosecutor on_ instructions\nsubmitted that the petitioner herein is not involved in any other\n\nseen\n4 arn\n2017/KER/1238\nCri. M. C. No. 7302 of 2016 2\ncase and that Annexure A3 judgment is not challenged in any\nother proceedings. Evidently, it has become final.\n\n3. Having regard to these facts, | feel that the petitioner\nherein is also entitled for the relief since the substratum of the\nentire prosecution case is lost by Annexure A3 judgment. Hence,\n| am inclined to allow the Crl.M.C, as against the petitioner herein\nin S.C. No.206/2016 of Additional Sessions Court - IV, Kottayam,\nnow pending trial.\n\nHence, Crl.M.C. is allowed as above.\n\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE.\nPn\n\n"
