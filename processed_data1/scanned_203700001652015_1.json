CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n12-01-2015, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nBar\n2015/KER/1264\nP.UBAID, J.\nCri.M.C No.165 of 2015\nDated this the \"12\" January, 2015\nORDER\nThe petitioners herein are the accused Nos.12 and 13\nin C.C No.127 of 2009 before the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate Court, Kothamangalam. When they failed to\nappear in court consistently, the learned Magistrate issued\nwarrant of arrest against them. It is submitted that the\npetitioners are in fact on bail. On the apprehension of\nremand to judicial custody on surrender, the petitioners\nseek orders under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure directing the court below to recall the warrant of\narrest on surrender. Of course, the learned Magistrate,\nwho has issued warrant of arrest for proper reasons, will\nhave to consider the request for recalling the warrant. |\ndo not think that the learned Magistrate will mechanically\nremand the petitioners to judicial custody when they\nsurrender and make application for bail, if their bail stands\ncancelled. The trial court will have to consider the\ngrievance of the petitioners regarding their absence on the\n\nBeisel\npea\n2015/KER/1264\nCri.M.C No.165 of 2015\n2\nday.\n\nIn the result, this petition is closed with direction to the\ncourt below that in case application for bail is filed by the\npetitioners on surrender in C.C No.127 of 2009, the same\nShall be judiciously considered, and appropriate decision\nregarding bail shall be taken by the learned Magistrate on\nthe date of surrender itself.\n\nSd/-\nP.UBAID\nJUDGE\nma\n/True copy/\nP.S to Judge\n\n"
