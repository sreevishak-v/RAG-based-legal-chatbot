TO JUDGE\nbp\n\nBier)\n2015/KER/17602\nP. UBAID, J.\nDated this the 5\" day of May, 2015\nORDER\n\nThe petitioners herein are the original accused\nNos.3,5,8,10 and 13 in C.C. No.951/2011 of the Judicial First\nClass Magistrate Court-ll, Hosdurg. The offences involved in\nthis case are under Sections 143,147,148,452,323 and 427\nread with149 IPC. The original accused Nos.1,2,4,6,7,9,11,12\nand 14 faced trial before the learned Magistrate, and obtained\na judgment of acquittal on 02.03.2015 under Section 248(1)\nCr.P.C., when all the material witnesses turned hostile to the\nprosecution in view of an amicable settlement made by the\nparties out of court. The prosecution examined twelve\nwitnesses in the said case and marked Ext.P1. None of the\nmaterial witnesses examined in the case supported the\nprosecution. In the absence of any evidence or incriminating\ncircumstance, the learned Magistrate acquitted the accused\nNos.1,2,4,6,7,9,11,12 and 14. The case against the petitioners\nherein was split up and refiled as C.C.280/2015. The petitioners\nnow seek orders quashing the prosecution as against them on\nthe ground that the very substratum of the prosecution case is\n\nnee)\n2015/KER/17602\n\nCri.M.C. No.2670 of 2015 2\n\ntotally lost by the acquittal of the others, and continuance of\nprosecution against them will not serve any purpose. Annexure\n\n- A3 judgment in C.C.951/2011 shows that all the material\nwitnesses examined by the prosecution in the said case turned\nhostile in view of an amicable settlement made by the parties\n\nout of court. In such a situation, it is quite definite that the\nprosecution cannot in any manner improve the case and the\nwitnesses also cannot in any manner help the prosecution, if\n\nthe case against the petitioners goes to trial. In short, such\nproceeding will be a sheer waste of time.\n\nIn the result, this petition is allowed. The prosecution\nagainst the petitioners in C.C.280/2015 of the Judicial First\nClass Magistrate Court-ll, Hosdurg will stand quashed under\nSection 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Accordingly,\nthe petitioners will stand released from prosecution.\n\nSd/-\nP. UBAID, JUDGE\nsd\n\n"
