The petitioner herein along with the mother were arrayed\nas accused on an allegation that, on 18/10/2011, the accused were\nfound in possession of Arishtam and Asavam and thereby they\ncommitted offences punishable under the Kerala Abkari Act.After\ninvestigation, final report was laid. Since the petitioner herein was\nnot available, non bailable warrant was issued and steps under\nsections 82 and 83 of the Cr.P.C.were ordered. The properties,\nhaving an extent of 37.03 Ares in Re.Sy No.170/2/7 and 144/1/15\n\nae\n2017/KER/49555\n\nCrl.M.C.No.6995/2017 2\n\nof Piravanthoor village, were attached by order of the Magistrate.\nPending the proceedings, the first accused died and the charge\nagainst her abated. The petitioner herein surrendered in 2017 and\n\nwas released on bail. Thereafter, he filed CMP No.2877/2017\nbefore the Magistrate praying to lift the attachment of the\nproperty. The above application was dismissed by the learned\nMagistrate holding that the application was filed after a lapse of 8\n\nyears from the date of the attachment and in view of Section 85(3)\nCr.P.C, the property vested with the Government and the accused\ncannot, after expiry of two years from the date of the attachment of\n\nthe property, request to lift the attachment and to release the\nproperty. It was held that, the remedy available to the accused\n\nfor lifting the attachment was to make a request to Government to\nrelease the property. The petitioner has to file an application\nbefore the District Collector for lifting the attachment, since the\nproperty vested with the Government, it was held. Aggrieved by\n\nthe above order, the 2Â¢ accused has preferred this Crl.M.C.\n\n3. Heard both sides and examined the records.\n\n4. The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner\nherein is that, under section 85 of Cr.P.C., the moment the accused\nsurrenders before the Court, and is released on bail, the\nattachment stands lifted. Once the person, against whom the\nproclamation was issued and whose property was attached,\nsurrenders before the Court and standing warrants are cancelled,\n\nae\n2017/KER/49555\nCrl.M.C.No.6995/2017 3\nhe is no longer absconding and the purpose of attachment of the\nproperty comes to an end.\n\n5. To substantiate the above contention, learned counsel for\nthe petitioner relied on the decisions reported in Vimlaben\nAjitbhai Patel v. Vatslaben Ashokbhai Patel and others\n( 2008) 4 SCC 649), and also the decision of this Court in Abdul\nKhadar v. State of Kerala (2015 (5) KHC 351) . On the other\nhand, learned Public Prosecutor, supporting the impugned order\nrelied on the decision of this Court in Moideen v. S.I.Police and\nanother (2010 (3) ILR 796), to contend that the right of the\npetitioner to get the property released from the attachment had\nceased to operate in the light of the time limit prescribed under\nsection 85 of the Act.\n\n6. A perusal of Section 83 Cr.P.C.indicates that it enables the\ncourt to order attachment of the property of a person absconding.\nSection 84 Cr.P.C. deals with the claims and objections to\nattachment to be preferred by any person other than the\nproclaimed person. Section 85(1) Cr.P.C.Provides that, if the\nproclaimed person appears within the time limit specified in the\nproclamation, the court shall make an order releasing the property\nfrom the attachment. Section 85 (2) provides that if proclaimed\nperson does not appear within the time specified in the\nproclamation, the property under the attachment shall be at the\n\nae\n2017/KER/49555\nCrl.M.C.No.6995/2017 4\ndisposal of the State Government. It is prescribed that the property\nshall not sold until the expiry of six months from the date of the\nattachment and until claim preferred or objection made therein\nunder section 84 has been disposed of.\n\n7. However, under section 85 (3) of Cr.P.C., if within two\nyears from the date of the attachment, any person whose property\nis or has been at the disposal of the State Government voluntarily\nor is apprehended and brought before the court and it is proved\nthat he did not abscond or conceal himself for the purpose of\navoiding execution of the warrant, the property shall be released to\nhim and if the property has already been sold, the net proceeds of\nthe sale or, the residue of the sale proceeds, as the case may be, as\navailable shall be returned.\n\n9. Evidently, statute provides for a self contained procedure\nfor attachment and disposal. The underlying object is to ensure the\nappearance of the accused and not merely to sell the property.\nInterpreting Section 85 (3) Cr.P.C., this court in Moideen v.\nS.I.of Police and another (supra), had held that under section 85\n(3) Cr.P.C if a person appears within the time limit, he should\nsatisfy the twin conditions mentioned therein. Ifthe said period is\nover, the absconding accused is not entitled to file an application to\nget the property released under sub section (3) of section 85\nCr.P.C.\n\n9. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Mrs. V.G.Peterson v.\n\nae\n2017/KER/49555\n\nCrl.M.C.No.6995/2017 5\nO.V.Forbes and Another (1963 KHC 640) in a proceeding\nunder the contempt of court Act held that essential purpose of\nkeeping the property under attachment was to secure the presence\nof the persons against whom action is proposed to be taken. In\nVimlaben's case , the Supreme Court held that provisions of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure do not warrant sale of the property\ndespite the fact that the absconding accused had surrendered and\nobtained bail. Once he surrenders before the court and the\nstanding warrants are cancelled, he is no longer an absconder. The\npurpose of attaching the property comes to an end. This view was\nreiterated by a Single Judge of this court in Abdul Khadar v.\nState of Kerala (2015 (5) KHC 361) , wherein it was held that\non surrender of the accused within two years and the warrant is\nrecalled, it has to be deemed that the court below was satisfied\nthat the accused did not abscond on his own and the satisfaction is\nsufficient to automatically release the property from attachment.\n\n10. It seems that in the present case the accused had\nappeared after two years and was released on bail. However, the\nquestion arise is whether the court can order the return of the\nproperty after two years. It seems that, this question was directly\nanswered by a Single Bench of this Court in Babu v. State of\nKerala (2011 (3) KLT 3838). It was specifically held in that\ndecision that after the expiry of the two years since the attached\nproperty is at the disposal of the Government, it is open to the\n\nae\n2017/KER/49555\nCrl.M.C.No.6995/2017 6\npetitioner to request the Government to release the property if it is\nnot already sold and the residue, in case any portion is sold or the\nsale proceeds if it is sold completely. It appears that the above\ndecision is squarely applicable to the facts of the case.\n\n11. In the light of the decision in Abdul Khadar v. State of\nKerala (supra), essentially it has to be held that pursuant to the\nrelease of the accused on bail, his attachment stands vacated.\nHence, the question regarding the release of the property, now lies\nwithin the domain of the government. Necessarily, the petitioner\nhas to move the concerned authority with appropriate application.\nHowever, since attachment is ordered by the Court, formal order of\nwithdrawing the attachment has to be passed by the court. Hence,\nwhile disagreeing with the finding of the court below that the\naccused, to lift the attachment, has to request the Government, I\nam inclined to hold that, in the light of the decision in Abdul\nKhadar v. State of Kerala (supra), it has to be presumed that\npurpose of attachment stands full filed. Hence, learned Magistrate\nought to have ordered withdrawal of attachment. The further\nremedy of the petitioner herein is to move the District Collector for\nreleasing the property, if in the meanwhile, it has not been sold.\n\n12. Hence, Cr.M.C.is allowed in part. Attachment is deemed\nas withdrawn. The petitioner shall file appropriate application\nbefore the District Collector to release the property. If such\napplication is filed, The District Collector shall pass appropriate\n\nBieta\n2017/KER/49555\nCrl.M.C.No.6995/2017 7\norders within a period of thirty days from the date of receipt of the\napplication treating the attachment as lifted .\nCrl.M.C.is allowed in part accordingly.\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS\nJudge\ndpk\n/true copy/ PS to Judge.\n\nEl 4\n2017/KER/49555\nCri.M.C.No.6995/2017 8\nCrl.M.A.No.5546 of 2017 in Crl.R.P.No.1272 of 2017\n\n"
