    "full_text": "IN THE COURT OF THE SESSIONS JUDGE,\nTHIRUVANANTHAPURAM\nPRESENT : SMT. NAZEERA.S, SESSIONS JUDGE\nOn Friday, 28\" day of February, 2025/ 9\" Phalguna, 1946\nCRIMINAL M..C. No.531/2025\n(Crime No. 243/2025 of Aryanad Police Station )\nPetitioners/Accused Nos.1 to 3:-\n1.

Sumayya, aged 38 years, W/o Thaswath,\nBinubhavan, Manaluvila, Aryanad PO,\nThiruvananthapuram.\n3. Thaswath, aged 40 years, S/o Thajudheen,\n\nManaluvila, Aryanad PO, Thiruvananthapuram.\n\nBy Advocates. M A Kasim and Alif KS\nRESPONDENT:-\n\nState of Kerala represented by\n\nStation House Officer,\n\nAryanad Police Station.\n\nBy Public Prosecutor Dr T Geena Kumary\n\nThis Crl.M.C. came up for hearing on 25/02/2025 and the court on\n28-02-2025 passed the following :\n\nORDER\n\nThis is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik\nSuraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail.\n\n2. The petitioners are alleged to have committed the offences\npunishable under Sections 126(2), 115(2), 118(1) and 351, r/w Section 3(5) of\nthe Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, and Crime No. 243/2025 of Aryanad Police\n\nCriminal M.C.No.531/2025 1/6\n\nStation is registered against the petitioners arraying them as accused Nos. 1 to\n3.\n\n3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- The defacto\ncomplainant is the wife of the 1* accused. During the period from 2021 to\nFebruary 2024, the defacto complainant rented out the residential building,\nowned by her husband, situated at Cheriya Aryanad to accused Nos. 2 and 3.\nWhen the defacto complainant came to know that, her husband is having illicit\nrelationship with the 2\" accused, she evicted accused Nos. 2 and 3 from the\nhouse. The defacto complainant got information that, even after vacating the\nhouse, the 2™ accused used to come to the said house along with the 1\" accused.\nOn 19.01.2025 at about 1 p.m. the defacto complainant came to the said house\nand found accused Nos.2 and 3 along with her husband, the 1* accused, in the\nsaid house. At that time, the 2\"? accused caught hold of the hair of the defacto\ncomplainant and pulled her towards the courtyard, and thereafter, the 1* accused\nbeat her on her left palm, by using a stick, and twisted on her left shoulder, and\nthe 3\" accused threatened her with fear of death.\n\n4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor.\nThe Investigating Officer filed report opposing the anticipatory bail application.\n\n5. Heard. Perused the records.\n\n6. The only point to be considered is, whether an order of\nanticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioners/accused Nos. 1 to 3.\n\nCriminal M.C.No.531/2025 2/6\n\n7. The Point:- The 1* petitioner/ 1* accused is the husband of the\ndefacto complainant. It is alleged that, the petitioners/ accused Nos. 1 to 3 had\nassaulted the defacto complainant, when she questioned the presence of the\n2™ accused along with the 1* petitioner / 1 accused.\n\n8. The petitioners submit that, the defacto complainant is the wife of\n1* accused and the relationship between them got strained and hence, the\n1* accused approached the Family court, Thiruvananthapuram, for divorce and\nfiled O.P.No. 76/2025. It is submitted that, the 3 accused is the husband of\nthe 2™ accused, and the alleged illicit relationship between the 1* and 2™\naccused is a cooked up story, in order to implicate the petitioners in the present\ncase. The petitioners submitted that, there is an inordinate delay of 25 days in\nlodging the F.I.R., as the alleged incident took place on 19.01.2025, but the\ninformation is received in the Police Station only on 13.02.2025. According to\nthe petitioners, they are innocent of the allegations levelled against them. The\npetitioners have produced a copy of the Original Petition for divorce filed\nbefore the Family Court, Nedumangadu, to substantiate their contentions.\n\n9. The magnitude of the offence alleged is grave. The alleged\nincident occurred in the house owned by the 1* petitioner / 1* accused, which\nwas earlier given for rent to the 2\" accused. Going by the First Information\nStatement given by the defacto complainant, it is seen that, though the house\nwas leased out to the 2™ accused earlier, she was evicted from there in the\n\nCriminal M.C.No.531/2025 3/6\n\nmonth of February 2024, and later, on the alleged date of incident, when the\ndefacto complainant saw her husband along with the 2™ accused, she had\nquestioned the same as she had noticed instances of illicit relationship between\nthe two. According to the defacto complainant, the 2\" accused was evicted\nfrom the said house in view of the relationship between the two, and even after\nthat, when she noticed that the 1“ petitioner and the 2™ accused used to come\nthere, she had questioned the same, and thereafter, the petitioners had assaulted\nthe defacto complainant. It is stated in the body note attached to the First\nInformation Statement that the defacto complainant had pain on the left palm.\nIt is stated in the report filed by the Investigating Officer that the stick used for\nthe commission of the offence is recovered. So, the prosecution has made out a\nprima facie case against the petitioners/ accused Nos. 1 to 3 and regarding the\ninvolvement of the petitioners in the alleged offence. It is also stated in the\nreport that the scene plan is to be obtained and the statement of the defacto\ncomplainant under Section 183 of BNSS is to be recorded. The investigation is\nprogressing. The learned counsel for the petitioners argued that, this is a false\ncomplaint initiated after the matrimonial dispute between the 1* petitioner and\nhis wife. He also submitted that, an Original Petition was filed before the\nFamily Court for dissolution of marriage. The learned Public Prosecutor stated\nthat the Original Petition is filed after the alleged incident. It is seen from the\nFirst Information Statement that, on that date, the defacto complainant and the\nCriminal M.C.No.531/2025 4/6\n\n1* petitioner were living together and that the dispute between them was in fact\nrelated to the alleged illicit relationship of the 1\" petitioner with the 2\" accused.\nSo the allegation against the petitioners cannot be considered as a false\nallegation as there are materials to show the occurrence of the alleged incident.\nConsidering the facts stated in the report to the effect that the petitioners are\ninvolved in the offence, it appears that exceptional jurisdiction to grant a pre-\narrest bail cannot be exercised in this case.\n\n10. In Jai Prakash Singh v. State of Bihar and Another (2012 (4)\nSCC 379), the Hon’ble Apex court has held that, an order of pre-arrest bail\nbeing an extra ordinary privilege, should be granted only in exceptional cases.\nIt is settled in law that arrest should be the last option and it should be restricted\nto cases where arrest is imperative in the facts and circumstances of a case and\nconsistent view is that the grant of anticipatory bail shall be restricted to\nexceptional circumstances. So it is clear that the power to grant anticipatory\nbail under section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita. is an\nexceptional power and should be exercised only in exceptional cases and not as\na matter of course. Its object is to ensure that a person should not be harassed or\nhumiliated in order to satisfy the grudge or personal vendetta of the\ncomplainant. [Reliance placed on the decision rendered by the Hon’ble Apex\nCourt in HDFC Bank Limited v. J.J. Mannan and Another (2010 (1) SCC\n679); Srikant Upadhyay v. State of Bihar (2024 KHC Online 6137)]. In the\n\nCriminal M.C.No.531/2025 5/6\n\ncase at hand, I find no exceptional circumstance to exercise the exceptional\npower of granting anticipatory bail.\n\n11. Considering the serious allegation against the petitioners and\ngravity of the offence, it appears that granting the petitioners with an order of\nanticipatory bail will adversely affect the investigation. If an order of\nanticipatory bail is granted, they are likely to influence the witnesses and tamper\nwith the evidence. Considering all these aspects, this court is not inclined to\ngrant an order of pre-arrest bail to the petitioners.\n\nIn the result, this petition is dismissed.\nDictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and pronounced by\nme in Open Court on this the 28\" day of February, 2025.\nSd/-\nNAZEERA S.\nSESSIONS JUDGE\n(Copies : 4)\nTyped by: Rifa True copy By Order\nCompared by: Manjusha\nFCS:\nSHERISTADAR\nCriminal M.C.No.531/2025 6/6\n\nCopy of Order in\nCriminal M.C.No.531/2025\nDated: 28/02/2025\nCriminal M.C.No.531/2025 7/6\n\n"
