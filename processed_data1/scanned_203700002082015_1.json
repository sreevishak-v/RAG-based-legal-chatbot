The petitioners seek orders under Section\n482 Cr.P.C quashing the prosecution against them before the\nJuvenile Justice Board on the ground that they have come to terms\namicably with the complainant out of court, and the complainant\nBiju Joseph has no grievance or complaint now. The complainant\nBiju Joseph is the second respondent herein. He has filed affidavit\nto the effect that the has settled the dispute with the petitioners on\nthe request of their parents, and that the whole dispute stands\nresolved forever. He has no grievance or complaint now. I am well\nsatisfied that the parties have come to terms amicably, and that\norders quashing the prosecution is required in the interest of the\njuveniles facing prosecution. I find that continuance of proceeding\nbefore the Juvenile Justice Board in the above situation will not\n\npS sa] ae\nops\n2015/KER/1523\nCri.
