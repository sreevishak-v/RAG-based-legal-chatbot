NAZEERA.S, SESSIONS JUDGE\nOn Saturday, 1“ day of March 2025/10\" day of Phalguna, 1946.\nCriminal M.C.No. 612/2025\n( Crime No. 157/2025 of Medical College Police Station, pending before\n\nAdditional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Thiruvananthapuram. )\nPetitioner/Accused__:-\n\nMuhammad Yasin aged 23 years\n\nS/o. Maheen, TC 68/2622(1) Neelattinkara\n\n(KNRA 78 A) Kamaleswaram Manacaud P.O Manacaud Village\n\nMuttathara Ward Thiruvananthapuram 695009\n\nBy Advocate:- G Nissar\nRespondent _:-\n\nState of Kerala represented\n\nby the Inspector of Police,\n\nMedical College Police Station\n\nBy Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumari\n\nThis Criminal M.C. is coming on for hearing on 28.02.2025 and the\ncourt on 01.03.2025 passed the following :\n\nORDER\n\nThis is an application filed by the sole accused in the above crime under\nSection 483 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking regular bail.\n\n2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable\nunder Sections 115(2), 324(4) and 69 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.\n\n2\n\n3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- The accused,\nwho got acquaintance with the defacto complainant, on 08.05.2023, took the\ndefacto complainant to Vitara Rooms Lodge, Kumarapuram, and under the false\npromise of marriage, had sexual intercourse with her. Thereafter, on several\noccasions, at various places, till 26.01.2025, under the false promise of\nmarriage, the accused had sexual intercourse with the defacto complainant. It is\nalso alleged that, the accused voluntarily caused hurt to the defacto complainant\nsaying various reasons, and on 25.01.2025, at Pop Town Hotel, the accused\ndestroyed the mobile phone of the defacto complainant, and he withdrew from\nthe promise of marriage.\n\n4. Reportedly, the petitioner/accused was arrested on 01.02.2025 and\nhe is in custody since then.\n\n5. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor.\nThe Investigating Officer filed report opposing the bail application.\n\n6. Heard. Perused the records.\n\n7. The only point to be considered is, whether regular bail can be\ngranted to the petitioner/accused.\n\n8. The Point:- The prosecution alleges that, the petitioner/accused,\nunder a false promise of marriage, had sexual intercourse with the defacto\ncomplainant, on several occasions, at different places, and thereafter, withdrew\n\n3\nfrom the promise of marriage. It is also alleged that, the accused physically\ntortured the defacto complainant and destroyed her mobile phone.\n\n9. According to the petitioner, he is innocent of the allegations\nlevelled against him. It is submitted that, though the petitioner had acquaintance\nwith the defacto complainant, there was no physical relationship, and the\nintention of the defacto complainant is to blackmail him. The petitioner\nsubmitted that, during his custody period, from 01.02.2025 onwards, the defacto\ncomplainant approached the parents of the petitioner several days and stated\nthat she is going to get the F.I.R. quashed from the Hon’ble High Court of\nKerala, otherwise, the petitioner will not get bail and he will be in custody for\nyears, and she demanded huge amount from them.\n\n10. There is serious allegation as against the petitioner. However, it is\nseen from the First Information Statement that, there was an informal\nengagement between the defacto complainant and the petitioner, and photo-\nshoot was taken. So, it is indicative of the fact that there was no dishonest\nintention from the part of the petitioner at the inception of their relationship or\nat the time of the alleged commission of offence. It is seen that, the 183\nstatement of the defacto complainant was already recorded and that the\ninvestigation has progressed much. The petitioner/ accused is in judicial\ncustody for a period of 28 days. It appears that further detention of the\n\n4\npetitioner is not warranted for the purpose of investigation. So even if the\npetitioner/accused is released on bail, there is nothing much, which will\nadversely affect the investigation. No criminal antecedents of the\npetitioner/accused is brought to the notice of this court. Considering the period\nof detention already undergone by the petitioner and the stage of investigation, I\nam of the view that, the petitioner/accused can be enlarged on bail subject to\nconditions.\nIn the result, the petition is allowed and the petitioner/ accused is\ngranted bail on the following conditions:-\n(1) Petitioner/accused shall execute bail bond for Rs.50,000/-\n(Rupees Fifty Thousand only) with two solvent sureties for\nthe like sum each to the satisfaction of the Additional Chief\nJudicial Magistrate Court, Thiruvananthapuram.\n(2) Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer on\nevery Wednesday between 10 a.m. and 12 noon for a\nperiod of 3 (three) months or till the final report is filed,\nwhichever is earlier.\n(3) Petitioner shall not commit any offence while on bail.\n(4) Petitioner shall not directly or indirectly make any\ninducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted\nwith the facts of the case so as to dissuade them from\ndisclosing such facts to the court or to any police officer or\ntamper with evidence.\n\n5\n(5) Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer as\nand when required by the Investigating Officer.\n\n(6) Petitioner shall fully co-operate with the investigation.\nIn case of any violation of the above conditions or misuse of liberty, the\nprosecution or the defacto complainant is at liberty to approach jurisdictional\ncourt for cancellation of bail.\nDictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and\n\npronounced by me in Open Court on this the 1* day of March, 2025.\nNAZEERA S.\nSESSIONS JUDGE\n\nCopies (4)\nTyped by : Manjusha\nComp by : Rifa\nFCS :\n\n6\nFair Copy of order in\nCrl MC No.612/2025\nDated:01.03.2025\n\n"
