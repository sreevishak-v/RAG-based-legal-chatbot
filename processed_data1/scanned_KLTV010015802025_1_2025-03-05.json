Rajan\nand Aneesh N.S\nCounter Petitioners/Respondents:-\n1. Station House Officer, Nedumangad Police Station\n2. State of Kerala\nBy Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumary\nCriminal M.C.No.658/2025 1/5\n\nThis petition came up for hearing on 04/03/2025 and the court on 05/03/2025\npassed the following :\n\nORDER\n\nThis is the 2™ application filed by accused Nos. 1, 2 and 3 in the above\ncrime under Section 483 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking\nregular bail.\n\n2. The petitioners/ accused Nos. 1, 2 and 3 are alleged to have\ncommitted the offences punishable under Sections 296(b), 115(2), 118(1) and\n109(1), r/w Section 3(5)of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.\n\n3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- On 04.01.2025 at\nabout 10.30 p.m., while the defacto complainant was consuming liquor in Central\nPlaza Bar, Nedumangad, accused Nos.1 to 3 abused him and brutally assaulted\nhim. It is alleged that, the 1* accused slapped on the right cheek of the defacto\ncomplainant and accused Nos.2 and 3 beat him on his back, pushed him down and\nkicked on his legs. Thereafter, the 1° accused uttered abusive words against the\ndefacto complainant and beat him on his head twice, using a beer bottle and a steel\njug, causing severe injuries on his head, and thereby attempted to kill him.\n\n4. Reportedly, the petitioners/accused Nos. 1, 2 and 3 were arrested on\n06.01.2025 and they are in custody since then.\n\nCriminal M.C.No.658/2025 2/5\n\n5. The earlier bail application filed by the petitioners was dismissed by\nthis Court as per Order dated 14.02.2025 in Criminal M.C.No. 433/2025.\n\n6. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The\nInvestigating Officer filed report opposing the bail application.\n\n7. Heard. Perused the records.\n\n8. The only point to be considered is, whether regular bail can be\ngranted to the petitioners/accused Nos. 1, 2 and 3.\n\n9. The Point:- The petitioners/accused Nos. 1, 2 and 3 are alleged to\nhave abused the defacto complainant, and attacked him, using beer bottle and steel\njug, causing serious injuries. The motive for the alleged incident is that the\ndefacto complainant stared at the accused, while they were consuming liquor in a\nBar Hotel.\n\n10. The petitioners submitted that, in fact, a scuffle occurred inside the\nCentral Plaza Bar, Nedumangad, between the defacto complainant and his friends,\nand in order to avoid the rumpus, the petitioners intervened in the matter, and at\nthat time, the defacto complainant abused them and fisted on the face of the 3\"\naccused. It is submitted that, due to the sudden provocation from the side the\ndefacto complainant, the accused also hit him on his face, and at that time, a group\nof people, who were inside the bar, attacked the defacto complainant with a beer\n\nCriminal M.C.No.658/2025 3/5\n\nbottle, and as a result, he sustained injuries. According to the petitioners, they are\ninnocent of the allegations levelled against them and they have not committed any\noffence as alleged.\n\n11. The magnitude of the offence alleged is grave. However, it is seen\nfrom the report filed by the Investigating Officer that the beer bottles and steel jug\nused for the commission of the offence were recovered, and the wound certificate\nof the victim was obtained. It appears that major part of the Investigation is over.\nThe petitioners/ accused Nos. 1 to 3 are in judicial custody for a period of 58 days.\nSo even if the petitioners are released on bail, there is nothing much, which will\nadversely affect the investigation. It is stated in the report that the petitioners are\ninvolved in other crimes. But, considering all the other aspects discussed afore,\nincluding the period of incarceration, I am of the view that, the petitioners/accused\nNos. 1 to 3 can be enlarged on bail subject to conditions.\n\nIn the result, the petition is allowed and the petitioners/ accused Nos.\n1 to 3 are granted bail on the following conditions:-\n(1) Petitioners/ accused Nos. 1 to 3 shall execute bail bond for\nRs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) each with two\nsolvent sureties for the like sum each to the satisfaction of the\nJudicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Nedumangadu.\nCriminal M.C.No.658/2025 4/5\n\n(2) Petitioners shall appear before the Investigating Officer on\nevery Monday between 10 a.m. and 12 noon for a period of 3\n(three) months or till the final report is filed, whichever is\nearlier.\n(3) Petitioners shall not commit any offence while on bail.\n(4) Petitioners shall not directly or indirectly make any\ninducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with\nthe facts of the case so as to dissuade them from disclosing\nsuch facts to the court or to any police officer or tamper with\nevidence.\n(5) Petitioners shall appear before the Investigating Officer as\nand when required by the Investigating Officer.\n(6) Petitioners shall fully co-operate with the investigation.\nIn case of any violation of the above conditions or misuse of liberty, the\nprosecution or the defacto complainant is at liberty to approach jurisdictional court\nfor cancellation of bail.\nDictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and pronounced by\nme in Open Court on this the 5\" day of March, 2025.\nSd/-\nNAZEERA S.\nSESSIONS JUDGE\n(Copies : 4) //True Copy// (By Order)\nTyped by: Soumya\nCompared bv:Maniusha FCS : SHERISTADAR\nCriminal M.C.No.658/2025 5/5\n\nCopy of Order in\nCriminal M.C.No.658/2025\nDated 05/03/2025\nCriminal M.C.No.658/2025 6/5\n\n"
