TO JUDGE\nmbr/\n\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.V., J PU GREROSS\n~ CrLM.C. No. 6870 of 2015\n‘Dated 1® June, 2016\nORDER\n\n1.The petitioners herein are accused Nos. 1 and 2 in S.T.\nNo. 2813 of 2012 on the files of the Judicial Magistrate of\n1* Class, Thiruvalla involving offences punishable under\nSections 188, 147, 148, 149, 427, 294(b) and 506(i) of\nthe IPC.\n\n2.Prosecution allegation is that the petitioners and the other\naccused persons in the crime trespassed into the property\nof the de facto complainant on 07.06.2007 and committed\nmischief by cutting open a pathway after violating the\norder of injunction in O.S.No. 79 of 2006 of the learned\nSubordinate Judges Court. Initially crime No. 138 of 2007\nwas registered by the Pulikeezhu Police which was later\nreferred. Thereafter, on the basis of the complaint filed by\nthe de facto complainant cognizance was taken as S.T.\nNo. 691 of 2008. The petitioners did not appear before the\ncourt below and the case was proceeded against as\nagainst accused Nos. 1 to 4.\n\nDiseeirrl\ns01eikERI3872\n\nCrl.M.C. No. 6870 of 2015 -2-\n\n3.As per Annexure 2 judgment dated 31.10.2012, the\naccused Nos. 1 to 4 were extended the benefit of doubt\nand were acquitted under Section 255(1) of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure. The learned counsel appearing for the\npetitioners submits that in view of the acquittal of the co-\naccused, the continuance of proceedings as against the\npetitioners would be nothing but waste of time and the\nprospects of entering upon a conviction on the same\nevidence is quite bleak.\n\n4.The learned Public Prosecutor oppose the contentions of\nthe petitioners and submitted that a perusal of Annexure\n2 judgment would reveal that both PW1 and PW2 had\ndeposed in tune with the prosecution version and the\nlearned Magistrate had acquitted the accused on the sole\nground that the evidence against them did not appear to\nbe credible. Non-examination of the neighbours was\nconsidered fatal and it was one of the reasons why the\naccused were acquitted. According to the learned Public\nProsecutor, the ratio of the Full Bench decision of this\nCourt in Moosa v. Sub Inspector of Police (2006 (1)\n\nDiseeirrl\nrapa a\n2016/KER/23872\n\nCrl.M.C. No. 6870 of 2015 -3-\n\nKLT 552) will not apply to the facts of the instant case as\nit cannot be said that the substratum of the case itself has\nbeen destroyed.\n\n5.I have heard the rival submissions. After perusing\nAnnexure 2 judgment it does not appear to me that this\nCourt will be justified in quashing the proceedings on the\nsole ground that the co-accused have been acquitted. The\njudgment rendered in the case of a co-accused and the\nreasoning of the judgment contained therein’ or\nappreciation of the evidence therein are not matters to be\ntaken into account for the purpose of granting any relief to\nquash the proceedings and thus bar the trial itself. In\nother words, the acquittal of some of the accused by itself\nis not a reason to bar the trial in the case of the other\naccused. I am of the view that this Court will not be\njustified in exercising powers under Section 482 of the\nCode in the instant case to quash the proceedings on the\nground that the substratum of the case has been\nshattered.\n\n6.At this stage the learned counsel prays that direction be\n\nEa\nBisnae\n2016/KER/23872\nCrl.M.C. No. 6870 of 2015 ~4-\nissued to the learned Magistrate to dispose off the matter\nin an expeditious manner. I don't find any reason to\nrefuse the said prayer.\nIn the result the petition is disposed off, directing the\nlearned Judicial Magistrate of 1% Class, Thiruvalla where\nS.T.No.2813 of 2012 is pending, to dispose off the said\nmatter in an expeditious manner, at any rate, within a\nperiod of 8 months from the date of production of this\norder.\nSd/-\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.Y.,\nJUDGE\nkp/-2.6.16\n\n"
