In the above case, the allegation was that, the\npetitioner herein had transported to India 3.5 kgs of gold from\nabroad. He was granted bail by Annexure 1 order inter alia on a\ncondition that the original passport of the accused shall not be\nreleased by the DRI till the trial is over. Subsequently by an order\nof this Court in Crl.M.C. No.2644/2013, a copy of which is\nproduced as Annexure 2, this Court reiterated that the passport\ncannot be released, since using the very same passport he had\nillegally imported 3.5 kgs of gold to India. The matter is still\npending before Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate (E.O),\nErnakulam.\n\nHence, | feel that time is not ripe for releasing the passport.\nCrl.M.C. fails and is dismissed.\n\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE.\n\nPn\n\n"
