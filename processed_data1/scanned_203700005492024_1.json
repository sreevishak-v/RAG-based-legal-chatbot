Petitioner\nis facing prosecution for the offence punishable under Section\n138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. Due to the failure\non the part of the petitioner to appear before the trial court, a\nnon bailable warrant has been issued. Hence, this petition.\n\n2. Sri.Praveen K.Joy, the learned counsel for the petitioner,\nsubmitted that summons had not been served on the petitioner\nand therefore he was unaware of the specific posting date. It\nis also submitted that petitioner is willing to appear before the\ntrial court and seek bail, especially since the offence is a\nbailable one.\n\n3. I have heard the learned Public Prosecutor as_ well.\nConsidering the nature of order that I propose to pass, notice\n\nBane a\nBipot\n2024/KER/4446\nCRL.MC 549/2024\n3\nto the 2\" respondent is dispensed with.\n\n4. Since the petitioner is an accused in an offence punishable\nunder Section 138 of NI Act, I am of the view that the\nlearned Magistrate ought to consider the application for bail\nand recall of warrant on the same day itself.\n\n5. Accordingly, there will be a direction to the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate Court-I, Chalakkudy, to consider the application for\nrecall of warrant and for grant of bail, if any, filed by the\npetitioner in S.T.No.2777/2017 positively on the same day of\nhis appearance.\n\nThe Crl.M.C.is disposed of.\nsd/-\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\nAMV/19/01/2024\n\n2024/KER/4446\nCRL.MC 549/2024\n4\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 549/2024\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES\nANNEXURE 1 TRUE COPY OF THE SECTION 82 NOTICE\nISSUED FROM JUDICIAL FIRST CLASS\nMAGISTRATE COURT, CHALAKKUDY DATED\n03.01.2024\nANNEXURE 2 TRUE COPY OF THE E-COURT PROCEEDINGS\nDATED 11.12.2023\nTRUE COPY\n\n"
