No.2327 of 2015\nDated this the 21\" day of April, 2015.\nORDER\n\nPetitioners are the accused in Crime No.196/2015\nof Edakkara Police Station on the files of the Judicial\nFirst Class Magistrate's Court, Nilambur. The above\ncrime was registered for the offences punishable\nunder Sections 498A and 406 read with Section 34 of\nthe Indian Penal Code. The second respondent was the\nwife of the first petitioner and other petitioners are\nthe in-laws of the second respondent. The above crime\nwas registered on the basis of the private complaint\nfiled by her before the lower court and after\ninvestigation the crime was registered against the\npetitioners under Annexure-II F.I.R. During the\npendency of investigation, the dispute between the\nfirst petitioner and the second respondent has been\nsettled out of court and owing to the settlement the\n\nae\nDOIS/KERI 705 7\n\nCrl.M.C.2327/2015-B 2:\n\nsecond respondent is not interested to prosecute the\npetitioners any further. The second respondent has\nfiled Annexure-—III affidavit stating that she does not\nintend to proceed with the prosecution against the\npetitioners. This petition is filed with a prayer to\nquash Annexure-II F.I.R. in view of the settlement\nentered into between the first petitioner and the\nsecond respondent.\n\n2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners,\nthe learned Public Prosecutor and the learned counsel\nfor the respondents.\n\n3. Both counsel appearing for the respective\nparties urged for quashing Annexure~II F.I.R. invoking\nthe inherent power under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. and\nthe learned counsel for the petitioners cited Gian\nSingh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)].\n\n4. I have meticulously considered the decision\nlaid down in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT\n108 (SC)]. In the above case, three Judge Bench of the\nApex Court, on a reference, considered the question\n\nBeas el\nuit tA\nrape eae\n2015/KER/17257\nCrl.M.C.2327/2015-B 23:\nwhether the High Court has power to quash criminal\nproceedings involving non-compoundable offences on\nthe basis of the compromise reached between the\noffender and the victim and answered as given below:\n“BT. The position that emerges from the\nabove discussion can be summarised thus:\nthe power of the High Court in quashing a\ncriminal proceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in\nexercise of its inherent jurisdiction is\ndistinct and different from the power given\nto a criminal court for compounding the\noffences under §.320 of the Code. Inherent\npower is of wide plenitude with no statutory\nlimitation but it has to be exercised in\naccord with the guideline engrafted in such\npower viz;(i) to secure the ends of justice or\n(ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any\nCourt. In what cases power to quash the\ncriminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R.\nmay be exercised where the offender and\nvictim have settled their dispute would\ndepend on the facts and circumstances of\neach case and no category can be prescribed.\nHowever, before exercise of such power, the\nHigh Court must have due regard to the\nnature and gravity of the crime. Heinous and\nserious offences of mental depravity or\noffences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc.,\ncannot be fittingly quashed even though the\nvictim or victim's family and the offender\nhave settled the dispute. Such offences are\nnot private in nature and have serious\nimpact on society. Similarly, any\ncompromise between the victim and offender\nin relation to the offences under special\nstatutes like Prevention of Corruption Act\nor the offences committed by public\n\nBeas el\nuit tA\nPapeete eat\n2015/KER/17257\nCrl.M.C.2327/2015-B 24:\nservants while working in that capacity etc:\ncannot provide for any basis for quashing\ncriminal proceedings involving such\noffences. But the criminal cases having\noverwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civil\nflavour stand on different footing for the\npurposes of quashing, particularly the\noffences arising from commercial, financial,\nmercantile, civil, partnership or such like\ntransactions or the offences arising out of\nmatrimony relating to dowry, etc., or the\nfamily disputes where the wrong is basically\nprivate or personal in nature and the parties\nhave resolved their entire dispute. In this\ncategory of cases, High Court may quash\ncriminal proceedings if in its view, because\nof the compromise between the offender and\nvictim, the possibility of conviction is\nremote, bleak and continuation of criminal\ncase would put accused to great oppression\nand prejudice and extreme injustice would be\ncaused to him by not quashing the criminal\ncase despite full and complete settlement\nand compromise with the victim. In other\nwords, the High Court must consider whether\nit would be unfair or contrary to the\ninterest of justice to continue with the\ncriminal proceeding or continuation of the\ncriminal proceeding would tantamount to\nabuse of process of law despite settlement\nand compromise between the victim and\nwrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of\njustice, it is appropriate that criminal case\nis put to an end and if the answer to the\nabove question(s) is in affirmative, the High\nCourt shall be well within its jurisdiction to\nquash the criminal proceeding.”\n5. In view of the proposition laid down above, the\nquestion to be considered, in the instant case, is,\n\n2015/KER/N7257\n\nCrl.M.C.2327/2015-B 5:\n\nwhether the non-compoundable offence involved in\nthis case can be compounded, in the exercise of the\ninherent power under Section 482 of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure. Prima facie, I find that the\noffences alleged against the petitioners will not\ncome under the category of non-compoundable\noffences, which are specifically excluded from\ncomposition, in the exercise of inherent power under\nSec.482 of the Cr.P.C. Going by the affidavit filed by\nthe de facto complainant, it is seen that the dispute\nbetween the accused and the victim had been amicably\nsettled and at present the de facto complainant has\nno subsisting grievance at all. The de facto\ncomplainant does not want to proceed with\nprosecution against the accused. Full and final\nsettlement and compromise with the victim are\nevidenced by Annexure-III. In view of the compromise\nbetween the petitioners and the victim, I find that the\npossibility of conviction is remote, bleak, and\ncontinuation of the criminal case would put the\n\n2015/KER/N7257\nCrl.M.C.2327/2015-B :6:\nparties to great oppression, prejudice and also\ntantamount to abuse of the process of the court. The\npresent criminal prosecution against the accused\nmust be put to an end to secure the interest of\njustice.\n\n6. In this analysis, the prosecution proceedings\nagainst the petitioners in Crime No.196/2015 of\nEdakkara Police Station on the files of the Judicial\nFirst Class Magistrate's Court, Nilambur will stand\nquashed, in the exercise of jurisdiction and power\nunder Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.\n\nThis petition is allowed.\n\nSd/-\n(K.HARILAL, JUDGE)\nokb.\n\n"
