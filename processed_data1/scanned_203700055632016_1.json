No. 5563 of 2016\nDated 4' October, 2016\nORDER\n\n1.This petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure (for short “the Code”) has been preferred by\nthe petitioners herein, who are the accused Nos. 1 and 2\nin Crime No. 1426 of 2016 of the Perinthalmanna Police\nStation. The aforesaid crime has been registered for\noffences punishable under Section 3 and 4 of the Kerala\nProhibition of Ragging Act, 1998. The 24 respondent is\nthe de facto complainant.\n\n2. The gist of the prosecution allegation is that on\n13.11.2015 at about 11.45 am, the petitioners had\nsubjected the 24 respondent to ragging inside the\npremises of the PTM Govt. College, Perinthalmanna.\n\n3.The 2.4 respondent has entered appearance through the\ncounsel and has filed Annexure-B affidavit wherein he\nasserts that he does not wish that the criminal\n\n2016/KER/42464\n\nCril.M.C. No. 5563 of 2016 2\nproceedings against the petitioners should continue. The\nlearned counsel appearing for the 2™4 respondent/ de facto\ncomplainant would invite the attention of this court to\nAnnexure-A, complaint filed by him before the Prinicipal of\nthe College. According to him, he had only complained\nthat the petitioners had asked him not to wear trousers\nwhich drooped down from his waist and branded footwear.\nAccording to the 2™4 respondent, the disputes have been\namicably resolved and he does not wish the criminal\nproceedings as against the petitioners should continue any\nfurther.\n\n4.The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners submits\nthat in view of the settlement arrived at between the\nparties, this Court will be justified in quashing the\nproceedings.\n\n5.The learned Public Prosecutor after getting instructions\nhas expressed his reservations in the matter of quashing\nthe proceedings on the basis of settlement. It is\nsubmitted that the invocation of powers under Section 482\n\n2016/KER/42464\n\nCril.M.C. No. 5563 of 2016 3\nof the Code in a case of this nature is not warranted.\nHowever, it is submitted that no other cases are reported\nagainst the petitioners.\n\n6.In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and Another [2012\n(10)SCC 303], the Apex Court has crystalised the position\nin respect of the powers vested in the High Court under\nS.482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, to quash criminal\nproceedings. It was held that the power vested in the High\nCourt under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code,\nis not limited to quashing proceedings within the ambit\nand scope of Section 320 of the Criminal Procedure\nCode. The three - Judge Bench in the above case,\nclearly expounded, that quashing of criminal proceedings\nunder S.482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, could also be\nbased on settlements between private parties, and could\nalso on a compromise between the offender and the\nvictim. Only that, the above power did not extend to\ncrimes against the society. It is also relevant to mention,\nthat the jurisdiction vested in the High Court under\n\n2016/KER/42464\n\nCril.M.C. No. 5563 of 2016 4\nSection 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, for quashing\ncriminal proceedings, was held to be exercisable in\ncriminal cases having an overwhelming and\npredominatingly civil flavour, particularly offences arising\nfrom commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership,\nor such like transactions. Further, guidelines were issued\nby the Apex Court in Narinder Singh v. State of\nPunjab [2014 (6) SCC 466] and recently in Rajesh\nKamath J. and Others v. Mohana Kurup and Others\n[AIR 2016 SC 2452].\n\n7.1 have considered the rival submissions and I have gone\nthrough the materials on record. The offence committed\nby the petitioners cannot be said to be grave and serious\nhaving ingredients of extreme mental depravity. It also\ndoes not appear that the offence in this case will have a\nserious impact on the society. More over, when the\nrespondent No.2 has settled the matter, the possibility of\nconviction is remote and bleak and the continuation of the\ncriminal case against the petitioners would be a futile\n\nohn\nSL aer\naba\n2016/KER/42464\nCrl.M.C. No. 5563 of 2016 5\n\nexercise. It would also put the petitioners and the 2\"\n\nrespondent to great oppression and prejudice.\n8.Having considered all the relevant circumstances, I am of\n\nthe considered view that this Court will be well justified in\ninvoking its extra ordinary powers under Section 482 of\nthe Code to quash the proceedings.\n\nIn the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-A\nFIR in Crime No. 1426 of 2015 of the Perinthalmanna Police\nStation and all proceedings pursuant thereto against the\npetitioners are quashed.\n\nSd/-\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.YV.,\nJUDGE\nSKS\n//TRUE COPY//\nP.A.
