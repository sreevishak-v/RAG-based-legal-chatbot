S.SAJJU, SR.PP\nTHIS CRIMINAL REVISION PETITION HAVING COME UP FOR\nADMISSION ON 07.01.2020, ALONG WITH Crl.MC.6176/2019(B), THE\nCOURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nBape ial\nCr1.M.C No.6176/2019 2020/KERIA35\n& Crl.R.P. No.752 of 2019 3\nCOMMON ORDER\nDated this the 7th day of January 2020\n\nPetitioner is the 1% accused in CC No.1211/2018 on the\nfiles of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-III,\nThiruvananthapuram for having allegedly committed offences\npunishable under Sections 120B, 116, 468 and 511 of 420 IPC\nr/w Section 34 of IPC.\n\n2. The allegation in brief against the petitioner and other\naccused is that they had hatched a conspiracy to manipulate the\nlottery drawing machines of the lottery department of\nGovernment of Kerala and that the 2â„¢ accused at the instigation\nof the 1* accused, who is the petitioner herein offered money to\nthe de facto complainant for setting the last three digits of\nlottery drawing machine in a particular manner, which was\nalready set and thereby attempted manipulating the machine.\n\n3. The petitioner had approached the trial court with CMP\nNo.670/2019 seeking a discharge. The learned Magistrate vide\nimpugned order dated 25.04.2019 at Annexure A5 in Crl.M.C.\nNo.6176/2019 found that the prayer was allowed in part and the\n\nBape ial\n\nCr1.M.C No.6176/2019 2020/KER/35\n& Crl1.R.P. No.752 of 2019 4\n\npetitioner was exonerated the offences punishable under\n\nSections 120B and 116 of IPC, whereas charge was directed to\n\nbe framed under Sections 511 of 420 and 511 of 468 r/w\n\nSection 34 of IPC. Aggrieved by the said order of not\n\ndischarging him completely, the petitioner filed Crl.R.P.\n\nNo.752/2019 and also filed Crl.M.C No.6176/2019 for quashing\n\nthe proceedings under Section 482 of CrP.C. Both these\n\npetitions were considered together.\n\n4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as also the\nlearned Senior Public Prosecutor in detail and perused the\nrecords, I find that the court below was justified in passing the\norder retaining the case against the petitioner for offences\npunishable under Sections 511 of 420 and 511 of 468 fr/w\nSection 34 IPC. At the stage of framing of charge and\nquashing of proceedings, it is not the appropriate time to either\ngo through the documents or the statements of the witnesses in\ndetail. The specific case against the petitioner is that he had\ninstigated the 2\" accused to manipulate the machine. Whether\nhe actually instigated the 2\"? accused or not is something which\nis to be proved by the prosecution during the course of\nevidence. Going by the allegations alone, the offences are\n\nPare hl\n\nCr1.M.C No.6176/2019 2020/KERIA35\n& Crl1.R.P. No.752 of 2019 5\n\nattracted. It is not possible for this Court either at the time of\n\nframing of charge, or at the time of quashing the proceedings as\n\nrequired under Section 482 of CrP.C., to consider these minute\n\ndetails in the evidence that may be adduced. The statement of\n\nthe witnesses cannot be gone into detail to conclude regarding\n\nthe complicity of petitioner.\n\n5. Under the circumstances, I am not convinced by the\narguments placed by the learned counsel for the petitioner\neither to quash the proceedings or to interfere with the\nimpugned order of the Magistrate not discharging the petitioner\nfor offences punishable under Sections 511 of 420 and 511 of\n468 r/w Section 34 IPC.\n\nIn the result, Crl.R.P. No.752/2019 as well as Crl.M.C\nNo.6176/2019 are not sustainable. While dismissing both these\npetitions, the learned Magistrate is directed to expedite the trial\nof CC No.1211/2018 for the reason that the petitioner is anxious\nto prove himself innocent in the matter and actually claims\nhimself to be a whistle blower, than an accused.\n\nSd/-\nASHOK MENON\n7mm JUDGE\n\na ea\nPlea\nCr1.M.C No. 6176/2019 2020/KERI435\n& Cr1l.R.P.
