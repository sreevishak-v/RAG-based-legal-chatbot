The de facto\ncomplainant and the witnesses at whose instance the crime was\nregistered are respondents 3 to 8. Annexures A3, A4, A5, A6,\nA7 and A& affidavits have been filed by respondents 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\nand 8 respectively stating that the dispute has been settled and\nthat they have no subsisting grievance against the petitioners.\n\n2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also, who, on\ninstructions, submits that the petitioners have no_ criminal\nantecedents.\n\n3. Having considered the gravity of the offences alleged,\nnature of the injury caused and having perused the affidavit filed\nby the respondents 3 to 8, the contents of which are submitted\n\nCrme 5682/2020 5 2021/KER/1123\nto be true and voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is\nsettled and that no public interest is involved in this matter.\nMoreover, in view of the settlement, possibility of the criminal\nproceedings ending in conviction is remote. As_ such,\ncontinuance of the proceedings will amount to an abuse of\nprocess of court and hence, in view of the legal position set out\nby the Honourable Supreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v.\nState of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh v. State\nof Punjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is no\nimpediment in granting the relief sought.\n\n4. In the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. The proceedings in\nC.C.No.450 of 2018 of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kasargod, as far\nas petitioners are concerned, is quashed.\n\nSd/-\nV.G.ARUN\nJUDGE\n1gk\n\nBIER sla\npoeta\nieee\nCrmc 5682/2020 6 202UKERILI23\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE Al THE TRUE COPY OF THE FIR DATED 10.12.2011\nIN CRIME NO.394/2011 OF CHITTARIKKAL POLICE\nSTATION.\nANNEXURE A2 THE TRUE COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT DATED\n30.11.2016 IN CRIME NO.39492011 OF\nCHITTARIKKAL POLICE STATION, KASARAGOD\nDISTRICT.\nANNEXURE A3 THE AFFIDAVIT DATED 23.11.2020 SWORN IN BY\nTHE THIRD RESPONDENT.\nANNEXURE A4 THE AFFIDAVIT DATED 21.11.2020 SWORN IN BY\nTHE FOURTH RESPONDENT.\nANNEXURE A5 THE AFFIDAVIT DATED 21.11.2020 SWORN IN BY\nTHE FIFTH RESPONDENT.\nANNEXURE A6 THE AFFIDAVIT DATED 21.11.2020 SWORN IN BY\nTHE SIXTH RESPONDENT.\nANNEXURE A7 THE AFFIDAVIT DATED 21.11.2020 SWORN IN BY\nTHE SEVENTH RESPONDENT.\nANNEXURE A8 THE AFFIDAVIT DATED 23.11.2020 SWORN IN BY\nTHE EIGHTH RESPONDENT.\n\n"
