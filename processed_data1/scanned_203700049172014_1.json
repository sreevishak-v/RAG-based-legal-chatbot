No.709/2005 of the Judicial First class Magistrate\nCourt- II, Kollam. Of the eleven accused seven faced trial\nbefore the Learned Magistrate and obtained judgment of\nacquittal on 30/4/2008 when all the material witnesses turned\nhostile during trial in view of an amicable settlement made by\nthe parties out of court. The case against the accused\nNos.4,6,7 & 9 was split up and refiled as C.C. 1111/2008. Now\nit is pending as L.P. No.52/2014 as against the petitioners\nherein before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court II,\nKollam. The petitioners now seek orders quashing the\nprosecution against them on the ground that in the above\nsituation, where everybody turned hostile during trial,\ncontinuance of the prosecution will not serve any purpose.\nAnnexure II judgment shows that the prosecution examined\ntwo material witnesses in C.C. No.709/2005, but they did not\n\n2015/KER/30\n\nCr.M.C. No.4917/2014 22:\nin any manner support the prosecution. Offence involved in the\ncase are under Sections 143,147,148,447,427 and 506 (ii) read\nwith Section 149 I.P.C. and under section 27 of Arms Act. A\nperusal of Annexure II judgment shows that the material witness\nturned hostile in view of a settlement made by the parties. In\nsuch a situation, the prosecution cannot, in any manner, improve\nthe case against the petitioners herein because if their case goes\nto trial, those witnesses will not support the prosecution. I find\nthat continuance of the prosecution against the petitioners will be\na sheer waste of time.\n\nIn the result, Crl.M.C is allowed. The prosecution against\nthe petitioners, as original accused Nos. 4 & 7 in C.C.\nNo.709/2005 now pending as L.P. No.52/2014 of the Judicial\nFirst Class Magistrate Court-II, Kollam will stand quashed under\nSection 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\nSd/-\nP.UBAID, Judge.\n\ndpk /true copy/ PS to Judge.\n\nBay\nFs ane\nayers\n2015/KER/30\nCr.M.C.
