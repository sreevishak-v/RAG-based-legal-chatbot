SHEEBA\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n24-04-2015, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\n2015/KER/17323\nK. RAMAKRISHNAN, J.\n~CrLM.C.No.2549 of 2015\nDated this the 24\" day of April, 2015.\nORDER\n\nThis petition is filed by the petitioner, who is the accused in\nLPC.No.186/2011 on the file of the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate Court-II, Hosdurg for issuing a direction under\nsection 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\n2. It is alleged in the petition that the petitioner was\narrayed as the accused in Crime No.46/2007 of Vellarikundu\npolice station registered on the basis of a private complaint\nfiled by the defacto complainant, the wife of the petitioner,\nalleging an offence under section 498 A of the Indian Penal\nCode, which was forwarded to the police for investigation and\nafter investigation, final report was filed and it was taken on\nfile as C.C.No.288/2009 on the file of the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate Court-II, Hosdurg. Earlier the petitioner was\narrested, produced and released on bail. But when the case\nwas posted for evidence, he could not appear and so the case\nwas transferred to register of long pending cases as\nLPC.No.186/2011 and non bailable warrant is pending against\n\n2015/KER/17323\nCrl.M.C.No.2549 of 2015 2\nhim. Since non bailable warrant is pending against him, he\napprehends that even if he surrenders, his bail application will\nnot be considered and he will be remanded to custody. So the\npetitioner has no other remedy except to approach this Court\nseeking the following relief:\n“On these and other grounds to be urged at the time of\nhearing itis most humbly prayed that this Hon'ble Court may\nbe pleased to direct the learned Judicial First Class Magistrates\nCourt-II, Hosdurg to consider the bail application being filed\nby the petitioner in Crime No.46/2007 of Vellarikundu police\nstation, Kasaragod district which is now pending as\nL.P.C.No.186/2011 on the files of the learned Judicial First\nClass Magistrate's Court-II, Hosdurg for enlarge the petitioner\non bail in the above case on the date of his surrender itself, on\nsuch conditions as deems fit and proper in the circumstance of\nthe case, so as to secure the ends of justice.”\n3. Heard the counsel for the petitioner and the learned\nPublic Prosecutor.\n4, Considering the nature of relief claimed in this petition,\nthis Court felt that the petition can be disposed of today\nitself.\n\n2015/KER/17323\n\nCrl.M.C.No.2549 of 2015 3\n\n5. The counsel for the petitioner submitted that though he\nis prepared to surrender, in view of the pendency of non bailable\nwarrant, he is likely to be remanded and his bail application\nwill not be considered, unless a direction is given by this\nCourt.\n\n6. The application was opposed by the Public Prosecutor.\n\n7. It is an admitted fact that the petitioner was the sole\naccused in C.C.No.288/2009 of the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate Court-II, Hosdurg and he was granted bail earlier\nand subsequently since he is absconding, the case was\ntransferred to register of long pending cases and it is now\npending as LPC.No.186/2011 of the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate Court-II, Hosdurg and non bailable warrant is\npending againsthim. The apprehension of the petitioner that,\nif he surrenders before the court, he will be remanded to\ncustody without any basis and this Court has in several matters\nof this nature observed that there is a duty cast on the\npresiding officer of the criminal court to consider and dispose\nof the bail application on the date of filing of the application\nitself as far as possible and so there is no necessity to issue\nany direction as such as claimed in the petition. However,\n\n2015/KER/17323\nCrl.M.C.No.2549 of 2015 4\nconsidering the apprehension raised in the petition, this Court\nfeels that the petition can be disposed of as follows:\n\nIf the petitioner surrenders before the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate Court-II, Hosdurg in LPC.No.186/2011\n(C.C.No.288/2009 in Crime No.46/2007 of Vellarikundu police\nstation of Kasaragod district) pending before that court and\nmoves for recalling the warrant and _ releasing him on bail,\nthen the learned Magistrate is directed to consider and dispose\nof the application on the date of filing of the application itself\nafter hearing the Assistant Public Prosecutor of that court as\nfar as possible on the same day itselfin accordance with law.\n\nWith the observations and directions, this petition is\ndisposed of.\n\nOffice is directed to communicate a copy of this order to\nthe concerned court immediately.\n\nK. RAMAKRISHNAN, JUDGE.\ncl\n\n2015/KER/17323\nCrl.M.C.No.2549 of 2015 5\n\n"
