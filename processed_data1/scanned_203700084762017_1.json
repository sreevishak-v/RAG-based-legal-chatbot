A. TO JUDGE\nPn\n\n2018/KER/257\nSUNIL THOMAS, J.\nDated this the 4\" day of January, 2018\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner is the sole accused in Crime No.1041/2017 of\nPattanakad Police Station, Alappuzha District for offences\npunishable under Sections 323 & 341 of IPC. It is alleged by the\nprosecution that due to previous enmity, on 23.09.2017 at 3.00\np.m., the petitioner herein pushed down the de facto complainant\nand kicked her. When the daughter intervened, she was also\npushed down. Alleging the offences committed, complaint was\nlaid and FIR was registered. Annexure Al is the FIR in the above\ncrime.\n\n2. The petitioner has approached this Court contending\nthat pending the investigation parties, who are neighbours, have\nsettled their disputes. To buttress the above contention, learned\ncounsel for the petitioner relied on Annexures A2 and A3\naffidavits allegedly affirmed by respondents 2 and 3, who are the\nde facto complainant and the injured. Learned counsel for the\nrespondents 2 and 3 acknowledged the due execution of the\nabove affidavits and reiterated the settlement arrived at between\nthe parties.\n\n2018/KER/257\nCri. M. C. No. 8476 of 2017 2\n\n3. The learned Public Prosecutor endorsed the settlement\narrived at between the parties and stated that the statement of\none of the respondent has been recorded.\n\n4. There is nothing on record to show that the petitioner\nis involved in any other crime. Essentially, the dispute arose from\na property dispute. Having considered these facts, | am inclined\nto invoke the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. treating the\ndispute as a purely personal one, without involvement of any\nlarger question of public importance.\n\nHence, Crl.M.C. is allowed. All further proceedings in Crime\nNo.1041/2017 of Pattanakad Police Station, Alappuzha District\nstand quashed.\n\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE.\nPn\n\n"
