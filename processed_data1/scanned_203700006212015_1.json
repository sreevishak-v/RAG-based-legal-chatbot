Orders are sought on the ground of amicable\nsettlement of the whole dispute between the accused and the de\nfacto complainant out of court. The de facto complainant Sumi\nis the 2Â°? respondent in this proceeding brought under Section\n482. of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He has filed affidavit to\nthe effect that he has settled the whole dispute with the accused\n\nand he has no grievance or complaint\n2. In so many decisions, the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt has held that even in cases involving non-compoundable\noffences, the High Court can quash the prosecution; be it at the\ncrime stage or at the trial stage or even at the appellate or\nrevisional stage; if the parties have really settled the whole\ndispute, or if continuance of the prosecution will not serve any\n\nPieper)\n2015/KER/17571\n\nCrl.M.C No.621 of 2015 2\n\npurpose. Here, IJ find a real case of settlement between the\nparties, and I also find that continuance of prosecution in such a\nsituation will not serve any purpose other than wasting the\nprecious time of the court, when the case ultimately comes\nbefore the court.\n\nIn the result, this petition is allowed. The F.I.R and\nfurther proceedings in crime No.374/2014 of the Upputhara\nPolice Station, Idukki will stand quashed under Section 482 of\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\nP.UBAID\nJUDGE\nab\n\n"
