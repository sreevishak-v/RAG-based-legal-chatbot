CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION\nON 09.01.2020, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE\nFOLLOWING:\n\noy\n2020/KER/1122\nCrl.MC.No.8881 OF 2019 (A)\n2\nORDER\nDated this the 9th day of January 2020\n\nThe petitioners are aggrieved by the\nimpugned order of the Special Additional Chief\nJudicial Magistrate, Ernakulam, at Annexure B,\nwherein exercising jurisdiction under Section\n14 of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of\nFinancial Assets and Enforcement of Security\nInterest Act, 2002 (herein after referred to as\n\"the Act') on petition filed by the secured\ncreditor the respondent herein, appointing Paul\nVarghese as Commissioner to take delivery of\nthe secured assets scheduled with the petition.\n\n2. The petitioners are aggrieved for the\nreason that Section 14 of the Act does not\nempower the Chief Judicial Magistrate to\nappoint an Advocate Commissioner to take\npossession of the secured assets. The learned\ncounsel appearing for the petitioners reads out\n\nIR]\nops 4 Te\n2020/KER/1122\nCrl.MC.No.8881 OF 2019 (A)\n3\n\nSection 14(1) 3*4 proviso, wherein it is stated\nthat, the District Magistrate or the Chief\nMetropolitan Magistrate may authorize any\nofficer subordinate to him take possession of\nsuch assets and documents relating thereto.\n\n3. Learned counsel for the petitioners\nsubmits that, an Advocate cannot be appointed\nas a Commissioner since the Advocate is not an\nofficer subordinate to the Magistrate.\n\n4. The learned counsel appearing for the\nrespondent drew the attention of this Court to\nthe decision Muhammed Ashraf v. Union of India\n2008(4) KLT 1, wherein, the Division Bench of\nthis Court has held thus;\n\n“With regard to the argument that a\nCommissioner cannot be appointed by the\nChief Judicial Magistrate as part of\ngiving assistance in taking possession\nof the secured assets while rendering\nassistance to the secured creditor to\nget possession of the secured assets, we\nare of the view that it is not necessary\n\nPigs el\nops i Te\n2020/KER/1122\nCr1.MC.No.8881 OF 2019 (A)\n4\n\nthat the District Magistrate or the\n\nChief Judicial Magistrate should go\n\npersonally and take possession. S.14(2)\n\nof the Securitisation Act provides that\n\nthe Magistrate can order even police\n\nassistance and use all necessary powers\n\nin taking possession of the secured\n\nassets.”\n\nThe Division Bench relied on the decision\nof the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sakiri Vasu _v.\nState of Uttar Pradesh & Ors. (2008 (1) KLT\n724 (SC).\n\n5. The learned counsel for the petitioner\nsubmits that what the Division Bench is\nordered, is that a Commission can be issued but\nan Advocate Commission cannot be issued,\nbecause an Advocate is not subordinate to the\nMagistrate.\n\n6. A reading of the Section clearly\nindicates that, the Magistrate is authorized to\n\n=\nBien\n2020/KER/1122\nCrl.MC.No.8881 OF 2019 (A)\n5\n\nappoint an officer subordinate to him to take\npossession of the secured property. When an\nAdvocate is appointed as a Commissioner, he\nbecomes an officer of the court and subordinate\nto the Magistrate.\n\nA reading of the Section and the precedent\non the point would very clearly indicate that,\nthe Magistrate has power to appoint a\ncommissioner, and definitely an Advocate as a\nCommissioner for identification of the secured\nassets and taking possession of the secured\nassets. The objection raised by the learned\ncounsel for the petitioner is puerile and\ntherefore sustainable.\n\nThe Crl.M.C is therefore dismissed.\n\nSd/-\nASHOK MENON\nJUDGE\n\nSPK\n\nBarat\nops 4 Te\n2020/KER/1122\nCrl1.MC.No.8881 OF 2019 (A)\n6\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE A CERTIFIED COPY OF THE M.C.NO.659/2018\nDATED 31.3.2016 FILED BY THE RESPONDENT\nANNEXURE B CERTIFIED COPY OF THE ORDER DATED\n27.11.2018 IN M.cC.NO.659/2018.\nRESPONDENT'S/S EXHIBITS:NIL\n// TRUE CoPy//\nPA TO JUDGE\n\n"
