The offences alleged against\nthe petitioners are under Sections 406, 420, 323, 324 and 498A\nread with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code. Now, it is submitted on\nbehalf of the petitioners that the entire disputes between the\npetitioners and the second respondent have already been settled\nand the second respondent has also sworn to an affidavit which is\nproduced along with Crl.M.C. as Annexure 3. Therefore, the prayer\nin this Crl.M.C. is to quash the entire proceedings in Crime\nNo.627/2014 of Ponnani Police Station, which is now pending before\nthe Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Ponnani.\n\n2. Heard the learned counsel for petitioners, learned Public\nProsecutor appearing for the first respondent and the learned\ncounsel for the second respondent.\n\n3. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab (2012 (10) SCC\n\neer\n2015/KER/17444\n\nCrl.M.C.No.2470/15 -2-\n\n303), the Apex Court held that, the power of the High Court in\nquashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of\nits inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power\ngiven to a Criminal Court for compounding the offences under\nSection 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Inherent power is\nof wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to be\nexercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power\nviz.; (i) to secure the ends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of\nthe process of any Court. In what cases power to quash the\ncriminal proceeding or complaint or FIR may be exercised where\nthe offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend\non the facts and circumstances of each case and no category can\nbe prescribed. However, before exercise of such power, the High\nCourt must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the\ncrime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or\noffences like murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly\nquashed even though the victim or victim's family and the\noffender have settled the dispute. Such offences are not private\nin nature and have serious impact on society. Similarly, any\n\n2015/KER/17444\n\nCrl.M.C.No.2470/15 -3-\n\ncompromise between the victim and offender in relation to the\noffences under special statutes like Prevention of Corruption Act\nor the offences committed by public servants while working in\nthat capacity etc.; cannot provide for any basis for quashing\ncriminal proceedings involving such offences. But criminal cases\nhaving overwhelmingly and predominatingly civil flavour stand on\na different footing for the purpose of quashing, particularly\noffences arising from commercial, financial, mercantile, civil\npartnership or such like transactions or the offences arising out of\nmatrimonial relating to dowry, etc. or the family disputes where\nthe wrong is basically private or personal in nature and the\nparties have resolved their entire dispute. In these categories of\ncases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings, if in its view,\nbecause of the compromise between the offender and the victim,\nthe possibility of a conviction is remote and bleak and\ncontinuation of criminal case would put accused to great\noppression and prejudice and extreme injustice would be caused\nto him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and\ncomplete settlement and compromise with the victim. In other\n\neer\n2015/KER/17444\n\nCrl.M.C.No.2470/15 -4-\n\nwords, the High Court may consider whether it would be unfair or\ncontrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal\nproceedings or continuation of criminal proceedings would\ntantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement and\ncompromise between the victim and wrong-doer and whether to\nsecure the ends of justice, it is appropriate that criminal case is\nput to an end and if the answer to the above question is in\naffirmative the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to\nquash the criminal proceedings.\n\n4. The allegation against the petitioners is that they have\ncommitted offences punishable under Sections 406, 420, 323,\n324 and 498A read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code.\n\n5. Now as submitted by both sides, the entire dispute\nbetween the petitioners and the second respondent has already\nbeen settled amicably and the learned counsel for the second\nrespondent has also stated that the second respondent does not\nwant to prosecute the criminal case filed against the petitioners.\nThe second respondent has also sworn to an affidavit before this\nCourt as Annexure 3 in this regard.\n\nigen)\n5 5 saree\npea\n2015/KER/17444\nCrl.M.C.No.2470/15 -5-\n\n6. In such circumstances, this is a fit case in which the\nproceedings pending against the petitioners in Crime\nNo.627/2014 of Ponnani Police Station, which is now pending\nbefore the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Ponnani can be\nquashed by this Court invoking the powers under Section 482 of\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure, in the light of the principles laid\ndown by the Apex Court in Gian Sing's case (supra).\n\nIn the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and the entire\nproceedings in Crime No.627/2014 of Ponnani Police Station,\nwhich is now pending before the Judicial First Class Magistrate\nCourt, Ponnani against the petitioners is quashed.\n\nSd/-\nANIL K.NARENDRAN,\nJUDGE\ndsn\n\n"
