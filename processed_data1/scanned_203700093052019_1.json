The case against the\npetitioner was split up and re-filed from the\nparent case, SC No.60/2002. The petitioner had\nearlier appeared and charge was framed against\nhim. But not being aware of that, the learned\nAssistant Sessions Judge directed him to appear\nagain for framing of charge on 20.8.2019, on\nwhich date, he was absent and his application\nfor exemption from personal appearance was\nrejected. The bail granted to him was cancelled\nand NBW was issued on 14.11.2019. The\npetitioner was reported to be abroad, consequent\nto which it was directed to take steps under\n\nre\n2020/KER/275\nCrl1.MC 9305/2019\n3.\nSections 82 and 83 cr.PC.\n\n2. Report was called for from the\nPrincipal Assistant Sessions Judge and in the\nreport, it is stated that inadvertently without\nnoticing that charge was framed, the case was\nagain posted for framing of charge. The\npetitioner is willing to proceed with the trial\nof the case. His plea has already been recorded\nand therefore there was no embargo in his\nappearing through counsel to proceed with the\ntrial. The case is not posted for trial and\nwitnesses have not been summoned. Despite that,\nhis bail was canceled, which apparently is a\nmistake on the part of the learned Assistant\nSessions Judge.\n\n3. In the result, the orders of the\nlearned Assistant Sessions Judge directing\ncancellation of the bail and issuance of NBW and\nto take steps under Sections 82 and 83 Cr.PC on\n20.8.2019 and 14.11.2019 shall stand quashed\nunder Section 482 cCr.PC. The petitioner shall\ncontinue in bail on the very same bond and shall\n\nBh\nBle ie\n2020/KER/275\nCr1.MC 9305/2019\n-4-\nappear before the court for trial as and when\ncalled for.\nThe Criminal M.c. is allowed as above.\nSd/-\nASHOK MENON\nJUDGE\nIg\n\nae\nph ua\nPee)\nee\n2020/KER/275\nCrl.MC 9305/2019\n-5-\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE-A TRUE COPY OF THE PROCEEDINGS IN S.C\n739/2014 OBTAINED FROM THE SESSIONS\nCOURT, THRISSUR DIVISION\n\n"
