NAZEERA.S, SESSIONS JODGE\nOn Monday, 3 day of March 2025/12\" day of Phalguna, 1946.\nCriminal M.C.No. 648/2025\nCrime No 238/2025 of Kattakada Police Station\nPetitioner/Accused No. 1 :-\n\nRojin John J aged 29 years S/o. John C\n\nresiding at Rojin Bhavan, Kazhachikkadu\n\nChandramangalam, Thiruvananthapuram\n\nBy Advocate:- Ananda Subramaniam\nCounter Petitioners :-\n\n1. State of Kerala\n2. The Station House Officer\nKattakada Police Station Thiruvananthapuram\nBy Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumari\n\nThis Criminal M.C. is coming on for hearing on 01.03.2025 and the court\n\non 03.03.2025 passed the following\nORDER\n\nThis is the 2\" application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya\nNagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail.\n\n2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable\nunder Sections 126(2), 296(b), 115(2), 118(1), 110, 351(3) and 324(4) of the\nBharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, and Crime No. 238/2025 of Kattakada Police Station\nis registered against the petitioner arraying him as the 1* accused.\n\n3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- Due to enmity\ntowards the defacto complainant, on 08.02.2025 at about 7 p.m., while the\n\n2\n\ndefacto complainant was going home along with his wife and his two children,\nin a scooter, and when they reached in the road in front of the house of the\naccused situated at Kazhinjikkadu, the 1* accused wrongfully restrained the\ndefacto complainant, abused him and slapped him on his left cheek, and when\nthe defacto complainant questioned the said acts, the 1* accused, by using a\nreaper, beat on his back, and when the wife of the defacto complainant\nintervened, the 1* accused beat her on her back with his right hand. Then, the\n2™4 accused, who reached there at that time, using a reaper, beat on the head of\nthe defacto complainant, and when prevented, it hit on his head and right hand,\ncausing injuries. When the defacto complainant fell down, the 2™ accused\nthreatened him, abused him and kicked him on his chest, and the 1* accused, by\nusing the reaper, damaged the bike, causing a total loss to the tune of\nRs.15,000/- to the defacto complainant.\n\n4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor.\nThe Investigating Officer filed report opposing the anticipatory bail application.\n\n5. The earlier pre-arrest bail application filed by the petitioner was\ndismissed by this Court as per Order dated 19.02.2025 in Criminal M.C.No.\n482/2025.\n\n6. Heard. Perused the records.\n\n7. The only point to be considered is, whether an order of anticipatory\nbail can be granted to the petitioner/ 1* accused.\n\n3\n\n8. The Point:- The petitioner/ 1“ accused along with the 2™\naccused is alleged to have restrained the defacto complainant and his family,\nwhile they were going to their house in a scooter, abused the defacto\ncomplainant, and by using reapers, attacked him and damaged his scooter. The\npetitioner/1* accused assaulted the wife of the defacto complainant also. The\nmotive as alleged is the misunderstanding of the accused persons that the\ndefacto complainant informed the police that they assaulted the grandmother of\nthe petitioner/1* accused.\n\n9. According to the petitioner, he and his father are absolutely\ninnocent of the allegations levelled against them and they have not committed\nany offences as alleged. It is submitted that, on the alleged date of incident, at\nabout 6 p.m., the defacto complainant trespassed into the house of the\npetitioner, uttered abusive words, and attacked him, and thereafter, the defacto\ncomplainant preferred a false complaint against the petitioner. The petitioner\nsubmits that, there is delay in lodging the First Information Report.\n\n10. There is serious allegation as against the petitioner. Allegedly, the\npetitioner/ 1 accused along with the 2™ accused had abused and attacked the\ndefacto complainant, using reapers, and assaulted his wife. In the body note\nwith the First Information Statement, it is noted that, a healed wound is seen on\nthe head of the defacto complainant and abrasion is on the right side of his\nchest. So, the prosecution has made out a prima facie case against the\npetitioner/ 1 accused and regarding the involvement of the petitioner in the\n\n4\n\nalleged offence. It is stated in the report that the seat cover and cushion cover\nof the motorcycle, and a reaper used for the commission of the offence, were\nrecovered and the wound certificate is obtained. It is seen from the report that\nthe loss sustained due to damaging of the motorcycle is primarily assessed as\nRs.15,000/-. The investigation is progressing. It is reported that the 1*\npetitioner is involved in one another crime. Considering the facts stated in the\nreport to the effect that the petitioner is involved in the offence, it appears that\nexceptional jurisdiction to grant a pre-arrest bail cannot be exercised in this\ncase.\n\n11. In Jai Prakash Singh v. State of Bihar and Another (2012 (4)\nSCC 379), the Hon’ble Apex court has held that, an order of pre-arrest bail\nbeing an extra ordinary privilege, should be granted only in exceptional cases. It\nis settled in law that arrest should be the last option and it should be restricted to\ncases where arrest is imperative in the facts and circumstances of a case and\nconsistent view is that the grant of anticipatory bail shall be restricted to\nexceptional circumstances. So it is clear that the power to grant anticipatory bail\nunder section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita. is an exceptional\npower and should be exercised only in exceptional cases and not as a matter of\ncourse. Its object is to ensure that a person should not be harassed or humiliated\nin order to satisfy the grudge or personal vendetta of the complainant. [Reliance\nplaced on the decision rendered by the Hon’ble Apex Court in HDFC Bank\nLimited v. J.J. Mannan and Another (2010 (1) SCC 679); Srikant Upadhyay\n\n5\nv. State of Bihar (2024 KHC Online 6137)]. In the case at hand, I find no\nexceptional circumstance to exercise the exceptional power of granting\nanticipatory bail.\n\n12. Considering the serious allegation against the petitioner and gravity\nof the offence, it appears that granting the petitioner with an order of\nanticipatory bail will adversely affect the investigation. If an order of\nanticipatory bail is granted he is likely to influence the witnesses and tamper\nwith the evidence. Further, no change in circumstances is brought out after the\ndismissal of the earlier bail application. Considering all these aspects, this court\nis not inclined to grant an order of pre-arrest bail to the petitioner.\n\nIn the result, this petition is dismissed.\nDictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and\npronounced by me in Open Court on this the 3 day of March, 2025\nSd/-\nNAZEERA 8S.\nSESSIONS JUDGE\nCopies (4) True copy By Order\nTyped by : Manjusha\nComp by : Rifa SHERISTADAR\nFCS :\n\n6\nCopy of order in\nCrl.M.C.
