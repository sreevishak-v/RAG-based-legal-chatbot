CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n07.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nCrl.MC.No. 8812 of 2018 2 201KERITOS\nORDER\n\nThis petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure (“the Code” for brevity).\n\n2. The 2 respondent is the de facto complainant in\nC.C.No.1165 of 2017 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate of First\nClass-III, Kollam. The 1* petitioner is the husband and the\npetitioners 2 and 3 are his parents. They are being proceeded\nagainst for having committed offence punishable under Section\n498A r/w. Section 34 of the IPC.\n\n3. The instant proceeding is initiated with a prayer to\nquash the proceedings on the ground of settlement of all disputes.\nThe 2\" respondent has filed an affidavit stating that she does not\nwish to continue with the prosecution proceedings against the\npetitioners.\n\n4. The learned Public Prosecutor has obtained instructions.\nHe submits that the statement of the 2\"? respondent has been\nrecorded and the State has no objection in terminating the\nproceedings as it involves no public interest.\n\nCrl.MC.No. 8812 of 2018 3 201KERITOS\n\n5. I have considered the submissions advanced.\n\n6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC\n303] and in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC\n466], the Apex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the\nHigh Court can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes\nbetween the victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the\ncriminal proceedings. Further in Jitendra Raghuvanshi &\nOthers v. Babita Raghuvanshi & Another [(2013) 4 SCC 58], it\nwas observed that it is the duty of the courts to encourage\ngenuine settlements of matrimonial disputes. If the parties ponder\nover their faults and terminate their disputes amicably by mutual\nagreement instead of fighting it out in a court of law, the courts\nshould not hesitate to exercise its powers under Section 482 of the\nCode. Permitting such proceedings to continue would be nothing,\nbut an abuse of process of court. The interest of justice also\nrequire that the proceedings be quashed. Having considered all\nthe relevant circumstances, I am of the considered view that this\nCourt will be well justified in invoking its extra ordinary powers\nunder Section 482 of the Code to quash the proceedings.\n\nIn the result, this petition will stand allowed.\n\nBaers\nCrl.MC.No. 8812 of 2018 4 2019/KER/705\nAnnexure-A final report and all proceedings pursuant thereto\nagainst the petitioners now pending as C.C.No.1165 of 2017 on\nthe file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-III, Kollam are\nquashed.\nSD/-\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN V\nJUDGE\nDsvi- TRUE COPY// P.A.
