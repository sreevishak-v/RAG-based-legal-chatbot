CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON\n04.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n* The name of the Police Station is corrected and substituted as\n“ Ramamangalam Police Station”, as per order dated 22/02/2021 in\nCr1.M.A.1/2021, instead of “ Puthencruz Police Station”.\nSd/-\nAssistant Registrar\n\nrape\nCrl.MC.No.5583 OF 2020(G) 202U/KER/108\n2\nORDER\n\nAn order accepting the refer report under\nSection 173(2) Cr.P.C. is under challenge by the\ndefacto complainant on the ground that sufficient\nopportunity was not afforded to lodge a protest\ncomplaint and the counsel engaged was not acted\nproperly. A mere perusal of the final report\nsubmitted would prima facie show the extensive\nnature of the offence alleged. Even going by the\nfinal report, it is prima faicie evident that the\npetitioner had sustained heavy loss in connection\nwith the alleged transactions. The default on part\nof the counsel cannot be a ground to deny the\nvaluable rights vested with the complainant to\nlodge a protest complaint on a refer report. For\nsecuring the ends of justice, it is fit and proper\nto quash the order passed by the learned Magistrate\naccepting the final report so as to afford an\nopportunity to the petitioner to lodge his protest\ncomplaint within a stipulated time.\n\nrape\nCrl.MC.No.5583 OF 2020(G) 2021/KER/108\n3\nThe order dated 01.10.2019 is hereby quashed\nby allowing the petitioner to lodge his protest\ncomplaint within one month from the date of receipt\nof a copy of this order, failing which, the\nMagistrate will be at liberty to accept the refer\nreport. The parties shall appear before the\nlearned Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,\nKolenchery on 20.01.2021.\nThe Crl.M.C. is allowed accordingly.\nSd/-\nP.
