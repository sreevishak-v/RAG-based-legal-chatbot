RAMAKRISHNAN, J. 2015/KER/17321\nORDER\n\nThis criminal miscellaneous case is filed by the\npetitioner to quash the proceedings in C.P.No.145/20104 on\nthe file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,\nHarippad, Alappuzha District.\n\n2. It is alleged in the petition that, the\npetitioner has been arrayed as accused in Crime\nNo.387/2014 of Kareelakulangara police station, alleging\noffence under Section 304 and 308 of the Indian Penal\nCode. According to the petitioner, on 03.04.2014 at about\n12.30 p.m., while the petitioner was driving a Volvo Tourist\nbus from Bangalore to Thiruvananthapuram and when it\nreached Nangiarkulangara at about 12.30 p.m., it collided\nwith a maruti 800 car, coming from the opposite direction\nand in order to avert the car, it hit against the bicycle,\nwhich was crossing the road and five adult persons\n\n2015/KER/17321\n\nCriminal M.C.No.2536 of 2015 ;\ntraveling in the car and a four year child were critically\ninjured and five persons died. Originally case was\nregistered under Section 279, 304 and 324 of the Indian\nPenal Code. He was arrested on 03.04.2014 and bail was\ngranted later as per order in B.A.No.3594/2014. Final\nreport was filed, in which he was charge-sheeted for the\noffence under Section 304 and 308 of the Indian Penal Code\nand on that basis, case was taken on file as\nC.P.No.145/2014 on the file of the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate Court, Harippad. According to the petitioner no\noffence under Section 304 or 308 of the Indian Penal Code\nhave been committed. So he filed this application for\nquashing the proceedings.\n\n3. Heard the counsel for the petitioner and\nPublic Prosecutor appearing for the respondent.\n\n4. According to the counsel, the case was\noriginally registered for the offence under Section 279, 304\nand 324 of the Indian Penal Code and later final report was\n\n2015/KER/17321\n\nCriminal M.C.No.2536 of 2015 ;\n\nfiled for the offence under Section 304 and 308 of the\nIndian Penal Code. According to the learned counsel, the\nallegations are not sufficient to attract the offence. It may\nbe mentioned here that, on going through the allegations,\nthis court felt that, it is not a fit case to invoke the power\nunder Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to\nquash the proceedings at this stage and the documents\nproduced by the petitioner are all matters to be considered\nby the court below at the time of trial and those documents\ncannot be considered at this stage for quashing the\nproceedings. It is also settled law that, ifa matter has to be\ndecided on evidence, then, it is not proper for this court to\ninvoke the power under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure and quash the proceedings at the initial stage\nitself. The petitioner can raise all his contentions before the\ntrial court after the case is committed to the Sessions Court\nand if he files an application for discharge, then that court\ncan consider those aspects and then pass appropriate\n\nap\n2015/KER/17321\nCriminal M.C.No.2536 of 2015\n4\norders in that application in accordance with law.\n\nWith the above direction and observation, the\npetition is disposed of. Communicate this order to the\nconcerned court immediately.\n\nSd/-\nK. RAMAKRISHNAN, JUDGE\n// True Copy//\nP.A. to Judge\nss\n\n"
