It was alleged by the prosecution that on\n18.5.2009 at 10.15 pm, the petitioners formed into an\nunlawful assembly along with 10 other persons and\ntrespassed into the office and demolished furnitures.\nComplaint was laid and crime was registered. After\ninvestigation, final report was laid and the matter was\ntaken cognizance of as CC.No.568/2009. It appears that\nthe third accused alone faced the trial. He was acquitted\nby Annexure-A3 judgment. The case against the\npetitioners herein was_ split up and _ *°refiled as\nCC.No.640/2017.\n\nnee\n2018/KER/48\nCrl.M.C.No.8780 of 2017\n2\n\n3. The petitioners have approached this court\ncontending that in the light of the acquittal of the co-\naccused, the substratum of the case is broken and the\nprosecution of the petitioner is not sustainable. It was\nalso contended that the dispute has now been settled with\nthe defacto complainant. To substantiate it, the learned\ncounsel for the petitioners relied on Annexure-A4, which\nis stated to be affirmed by the defacto complainant, who\nis arrayed as the second respondent. The learned counsel\nfor the second respondent submitted that the matter has\nbeen settled and he has no objection in quashing the\nproceedings. The learned Public prosecutor on\ninstructions submitted that Annexure-A3 judgment was\nnot challenged in any other proceedings and that the\npetitioners are not involved in any other case. Evidently,\nAnnexure-A3 judgment has become final. A perusal of\nthe judgment shows that the court, after evaluation of the\navailable materials acquitted the third accused.\n\n4. Hence, there is no scope for a _ successful\n\nnee\n\n2018/KER/48\nCrl.M.C.No.8780 of 2017 3\nprosecution of the petitioners herein. Evidently the\nparties have also settled the dispute. They are not\ninvolved in any other crime. Having considered these\nfacts, I feel that the interest of justice demands the\nquashing of the entire proceedings. Hence Crl.M.C is liable\nto be allowed.\n\n5. However, it is pertinent to note that though the\ncrime is of the year 2009, the petitioners herein remained\nelusive and did not participate in the judicial proceedings.\nThe case against them was split up and refiled. This has\ncaused considerable delay in the judicial proceedings.\nHaving considered this, I am inclined to invoke the\njurisdiction under section 482 Cr.P.C only subject to\npayment of cost by each of the petitioner. Hence Crl.M.C\nwill stand allowed and all further proceedings in\nCC.No.640/2017 on the files of the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate Court, Payyannur arising from Crime\nNo.126/2009 of Pazhayangadi Police Station as against\nthe petitioners herein will stand quashed on condition that\n\nBLsRnl\n2018/KER/48\nCrl.M.C.No.8780 of 2017\n4\neach of the petitioner deposits a sum of Rs.1500/- to the\nKerala State Mediation and Conciliation Committee, High\nCourt of Kerala, Ernakulam, within one month from today\nand produce proof, before this court.\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE\nR.AV\n//True Copy//\nPA to Judge\n\n"
