The allegation of the prosecution is that, on 4/4/2016 at 11\n15PM, the accused, after consuming alcohol, trespassed into\nValiyamala police station and uttered obscene words. He refused\nto comply with the lawful directions given by the woman police\nconstable. Crime was registered and after investigation final report\nwas laid.\n\n3. Contenting that he is a highly religious person, that he was\nfalsely implicated due to reasons best known to him and that the\npolice have made every attempt to procure certificate to make it\nappear that the petitioner was drunk at the time of the incident,\nthe petitioner has approached this Court seeking reliefs. It was\ncontended by the learned counsel for the petitioner, relying on\nAnnexure AIII certificate, that the petitioner herein was certified to\nbe not drunk by the duty doctor attached to the Nedumangad\nDistrict Hospital . It was further contended that pressure was\n\nal\n2017/KER/1514\nCrl.M.C.NO.7179/2016 2\nexerted on the doctor to give the certificate otherwise.\n\n4. Learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted that\nthe petitioner herein is involved in other cases and that alcometer\ntest conducted on the relevant day established that he was drunk\nat the relevant time. But, the doctor gave a certificate to the\ncontrary. It was submitted that hence a complaint was submitted\nto the Director of Health Services.\n\n5. I do not propose to go into the merits of the relevant\ncontentions except to hold that essentially it is a matter to be\nestablished by the prosecution on the basis of the evidence let in by\nit at the time of trial. Hence, the question now cannot be\nanswered in the light of the materials available to held that no\nmaterial is placed before the court below to prove the allegations.\n\nIn the light of the above, I am not inclined to invoke the\njurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C. However, the petitioner\nherein will be free to raise all his objections before the trial court\neven at the appropriate stage.\n\nSUNIL THOMAS\nJudge\ndpk\n\nBiehl\nee\nBea\n2017/KER/1I514\nCri.M.C.NO.7179/2016 3\n\n"
