TO JUDGE\n\nrs\n\nsae ee oe a\nlee\n2016/KER/33666\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.Y, J\nDated this the 1* day of August, 2016\nORDER\n\ni.The petitioners are accused Nos.1 to 4 in C.C. No.1453 of\n2015 on the file of the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate\nCourt, Ernakulam. They have been charged for having\ncommitted offences punishable under sections 341, 323,\n326 read with 34 of the IPC.\n\n2. The 24 respondent is the de facto complainant and the\nson-in-law of the 1st petitioner herein. It appears that\nthere were matrimonial disputes between the 2nd\nrespondent and Archana, the daughter of the 1s\npetitioner. The prosecution allegation is that on\n10.5.2012 at 12.00 noon, the petitioners had assaulted\nthe de facto complainant causing injuries.\n\n3.Heard the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners,\n2.4 respondent as well as the learned Public Prosecutor.\n\nsae ee oe a\nDO1GIKERIS3666\n\nCrl.M.C.4506/2016 2\n\n4.It is submitted by the learned counsel that the disputes\nbetween the 2.4 respondent and Archana, the daughter of\nthe ist petitioner, has been settled amicably and the\nmarriage has also been dissolved by a decree of divorce.\nReferring to Annexure-A4 affidavit filed by the 2\"\nrespondent it is submitted that the 2â„¢ respondent has\nasserted that he does not wish or intend to continue the\ncriminal proceedings against the petitioners any further.\n\n5.The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submits\nthat the petitioners are not persons with criminal\nantecedents.\n\n6.It is thus borne out from the submissions made at the bar\nthat the parties have amicably settled their disputes by\ntheir own free will and without any kind of pressure,\ninfluence or coercion. The compromise, it is felt, is\nvoluntarily and genuine and can be acted upon.\n\n7.In_ Gian Singh v. State of Punjab (2012) 10 SCC\n303), Apex Court has held that in appropriate cases, the\n\nsae ee oe a\nDO1GIKERIS3666\n\nCrl.M.C.4506/2016 3\nHigh Court can take note of the amicable resolution of\ndisputes between the victim and the wrongdoer to put an\nend to the criminal proceedings. This view was reiterated\nin Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab. (2014) 6 SCC\n466) and Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State of\nJharkhand and Another 2014 (9) SCC 653 .\n\n8.After having heard the submissions of the learned Counsel\nand on perusing the records, it appears that the offences\nare entirely personal in nature and do not affect public\npeace or tranquility. It is also felt that quashing of\nproceedings on account of compromise would bring about\npeace. In a case such as the instant one, even if the\nprosecution is allowed to continue, it would not serve any\npurpose as the possibility of conviction is remote and\nbleak. It can only result in putting the de _ facto\ncomplainant and the accused to unwanted oppression and\nprejudice. Settlement will augur well for the interest of\nthe community and will enable the parties to live in peace\n\nBearer\nS\nBIR\n2016/KER/33666\nCrl.M.C.4506/2016 4\nand harmony.\nIn the result, this petition is allowed. All further\nproceedings against the petitioners, who are accused\nNos.i to 4 in C.C. No.1453 of 2015 on the file of the\nAdditional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Ernakulam,\nshall stand quashed.\nSd/-\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.V.\nJUDGE\nvps\n\n"
