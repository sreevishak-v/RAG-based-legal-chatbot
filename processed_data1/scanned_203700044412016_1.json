TO JUDGE\nmbr/\n\nrape\n2016/KER/34123\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.Y, J\nDated this the 4\" day of August, 2016\nORDER\n\n1.The petitioner is the sole accused in C.C.No.907 of 2015\n\non the file of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class Court-I,\n\nKozhikode. He has been charged for having committed\n\noffence punishable under sections 3, 4 read with section\n\n17 of the Money Lenders Act and also under section 3 read\n\nwith section 4 of Exorbitant Interest Act. The respondents\n2 to 9 are the victims.\n\n2.The instant petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code\n\nof Criminal Procedure banking on the ratio of the\n\nJudgment rendered by the Apex Court in Gian Singh v.\n\nState of Punjab ( 2012 (4) KLT 108) and a series of\n\nother cases which include Narinder Singh and others v.\n\nState of Punjab and anr. (2014) 6 SCC 466) and\n\nYogendra Yadav and others V State of Jharkhand\n\nsoleikeR E4123\n\nCrl.M.C.4441/2016 2\n(2014 (9) SCC 653 ) with a prayer to quash the above\nproceeding.\n\n3.The sole ground is that the Apex Court in the above\njudgments have delineated the circumstances and the\ncases in which inherent powers under Section 482 can be\ninvoked de hors section 320 of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure for recognizing out of court settlement for the\npurpose of quashing criminal proceedings. It is prayed\nthat powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure be invoked to quash the criminal proceedings.\n\n4.It is submitted that the parties have reached an out of\ncourt settlement and there is no acrimony between them\nat present. All the disputes have been amicably resolved\nand they desire to live in peace and harmony. The\nrespondents 2 to 9 have filed separate affidavits wherein\nthey assert that they have no objection in terminating the\nproceedings.\n\n5.The gist of the allegation is that the petitioner in course of\n\nsoleikeR E4123\n\nCrl.M.C.4441/2016 3\nthe illegal money lending activity conducted by him had\nobtained valuable securities and other documents from\nrespondents 2 to 9 in this petition. It is submitted by the\nlearned counsel appearing for the petitioner that the\npetitioner was conducting a valid money lending business,\nas evidenced by Annexure-I. It is also submitted that the\nmatter has been amicably settled between the petitioner\nand the party respondents.\n\n6.The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submits\nthat no other cases of heinous nature are reported against\nthe petitioner.\n\n7.1 have given my anxious consideration to the submissions\nmade across the bar and I have also gone through the\nmaterials on record.\n\n8.The respondents 2 to 9 have sworn to separate affidavits\nin which they assert that they have no objection in\nallowing the petition and in quashing the proceedings as\nall the disputes between the parties have been resolved\n\nsoleikeR E4123\n\nCrl.M.C.4441/2016 4\nand the parties are living in peace and harmony.\n\n9.It appears to me that the offence is entirely personal in\nnature and do not affect public peace or tranquility. It is\nalso felt that quashing of proceedings on account of\ncompromise would bring about peace. In a case such as\nthe instant one, even if the prosecution is allowed to\ncontinue, it would not serve any purpose as the possibility\nof conviction is remote and bleak. It can only result in\nputting the de facto complainant and the accused to\nunwanted oppression and prejudice. Settlement will augur\nwell for the interest of the community and will enable the\nparties to live in peace and harmony.\n\n10.1 am of the view that this Court is well justified in\nquashing the impugned proceedings as the instant case\nfalls within the matrix of guidelines issued by the Apex\nCourt in Gian Singh ( Supra ) and the other cases referred\nto above.\n\nIn the result, this petition is allowed. All further\n\nRiga\n.\nBie\n2016/KER/34123\nCrl.M.C.4441/2016 5\nproceedings against the petitioner, who is the sole\naccused in C.C.No.907 of 2015 on the file of the Judicial\nMagistrate of First Class Court-I, Kozhikode, shall stand\nquashed.\nSd/-\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.Y.\nJUDGE\nvps\n\n"
