NAZEERA.S, SESSIONS JUDGE\nOn Saturday, 1° day of March 2025/10\" day of Phalguna, 1946.\nCriminal M.C.No. 628/2025\n( Crime No. 141/2025 of Valiyathura Police Station pending\nbefore the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court -XI Thiruvananthapuram)\nPetitioner :-\n\nBipin Thomas aged 36 years\n\nS/o. Thomas, Bipin Bhavan Narikkal Desam\n\nKottavattam Chakkuvarakkal Village\n\nVettikavala Panchayath Kollam\n\nBy Advocate:- Honey MA\nCounter Petitioners :-\n\n1. State of Kerala\n2. The Station House Officer\nValiyathura Police Station Thiruvananthapuram\nBy Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumari\n\nThis Criminal M.C. is coming on for hearing on 28.02.2025 and the court\n\non 01.03.2025 passed the following :\nORDER\n\nThis is an application filed by the sole accused in the above crime under\nSection 483 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking regular bail.\n\n2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable\nunder Sections 75(1)(iii), 75(1)(iv), 75(2), 78(1)(ii), 78(2) and 79 of the Bharatiya\nNyaya Sanhita, and Section 67A of the Information Technology Act.\n\n3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- The accused, from\n25.01.2025 onwards repeatedly called the defacto complainant over phone, and when\nshe blocked his phone number, on 27.01.2025, the accused, by using another phone\n\n2\nnumber, tried to contact the defacto complainant through Whatsapp video call and the\ndefacto complainant did not attend the call. Thereafter, the accused sent a message to\nher asking her to attend the video call, and subsequently, on 02.02.2025, the accused\nshowed his private part to the defacto complainant by way of video call, and followed\nher, despite a clear indication of disinterest by her.\n\n4. Reportedly, the petitioner/accused was arrested on 05.02.2025 and he is\nin custody since then.\n\n5. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The\nInvestigating Officer filed report opposing the bail application.\n\n6. Heard. Perused the records.\n\n7. The only point to be considered is, whether regular bail can be granted\nto the petitioner/accused.\n\n8. ‘The Point:- The petitioner/accused and the defacto complainant\nare total strangers. The petitioner/accused is alleged to have followed and attempted\nto contact the defacto complainant over phone, to foster personal interaction\nrepeatedly, despite a clear indication of disinterest by her, and had showed his\nprivate part to her through Whatsapp video call.\n\n9. The petitioner submits that, he and the defacto complainant are friends\nand known to each other for the past several months, and they used to talk each other\nover phone and became close friends. It is submitted that, the defacto complainant\nused to borrow money from the petitioner saying that she is in financial crisis, and on\n10.10.2024, the defacto complainant asked him to meet her for discussing some\n\n3\n\npersonal matter, and as required, the petitioner met the defacto complainant, and that\ntime, she told him that she is in urgent need of money and requested the petitioner to\nlend her Rs.1,60,000/-, and since it was a very huge amount, the petitioner was\nunable to arrange it. It is also submitted that, the petitioner gave her Rs.60,000/- on\n23.01.2024, and though she agreed to repay the said amount after six months, she\ntold excuses for repaying the same, and thus their relationship got strained, and\nthereafter, on 25.01.2025, the defacto complainant made video call to the petitioner\nand they quarreled each other, and thereafter, the present false complaint has been\nfiled.\n\n10. ‘There is serious allegation as against the petitioner. However, it is seen\nfrom the report filed by the Investigating Officer that the mobile phone of the\npetitioner/accused was seized and potency certificate of the petitioner was obtained.\nIt appears that, the major part of the investigation is over. The petitioner/ accused is\nin judicial custody for a period of 23 days. It appears that further detention of the\npetitioner is not warranted for the purpose of investigation. So even if the petitioner\nis released on bail, there is nothing much, which will adversely affect the\ninvestigation. No criminal antecedents of the petitioner/accused is brought to the\nnotice of this court. Considering the period of detention already undergone by the\npetitioner and the stage of investigation, I am of the view that, the petitioner/accused\ncan be enlarged on bail subject to conditions.\n\nIn the result, the petition is allowed and the petitioner/ accused is\ngranted bail on the following conditions:-\n\n4\n\n(1) Petitioner/accused shall execute bail bond for Rs.50,000/-\n(Rupees Fifty Thousand only) with two solvent sureties for the\nlike sum each to the satisfaction of the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate Court-XI, Thiruvananthapuram.\n\n(2) Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer on every\nMonday between 10 a.m. and 12 noon for a period of 3 (three)\nmonths or till the final report is filed, whichever is earlier.\n\n(3) Petitioner shall not commit any offence while on bail.\n\n(4) Petitioner shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement,\nthreat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the\ncase so as to dissuade them from disclosing such facts to the\ncourt or to any police officer or tamper with evidence.\n\n(5) Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer as and\nwhen required by the Investigating Officer.\n\n(6) Petitioner shall fully co-operate with the investigation.\n\nIn case of any violation of the above conditions or misuse of liberty, the prosecution\nor the defacto complainant is at liberty to approach jurisdictional court for\ncancellation of bail.\nDictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and\npronounced by me in Open Court on this the 1* day of March, 2025.\nNAZEERA 8S.\nSESSIONS JUDGE\nCopies (4)\nTyped by : Manjusha\nComp by : Rifa\nFCS :\n\n5\nFair Copy of order in\nin Crl.M.C.
