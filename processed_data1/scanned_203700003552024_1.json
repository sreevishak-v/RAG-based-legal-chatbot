V. SREEJA (PP)\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n17.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\n2024/KER/4635\nCRL.MC NO. 355 OF 2024\n3\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.\nCrl.M.C.No.355 of 2024\nDated this the 17\" day of January 2024\nORDER\n\nPetitioner was issued with a Non Bailable Warrant in three cases\narising under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instrument Act. She filed\napplication for recall of warrant in all the three cases. Without even her\npresence, the learned Magistrate directed recall of warrant in two cases\nnoticing that the petitioner is an aged lady and had even taken bail\nearlier. However, in S.T.No.963/2022, the learned Magistrate declined to\nrecall the warrant on noticing that bail had never been taken by the\npetitioner. Since petitioner had not been released on bail in the said\ncase, the learned Magistrate refused to recall the Non Bailable Warrant\nwithout the presence of the petitioner.\n\n2. Sri.C.S.Manu, learned Counsel for the petitioner contended\nthat due to old age and various illnesses petitioner is unable to appear\nbefore the Magistrate immediately.\n\n3. Smt.Sreeja V., learned Public Prosecutor opposed the\napplication and pointed out that in the impugned order, the learned\nMagistrate had considered the distinction with the two other cases and\n\n2024/KER/4635\nCRL.MC NO. 355 OF 2024\n4\nrefused to recall] the warrant, which cannot be said to be perverse.\n\n4. On a perusal of Annexures A2, A3 and A4 orders, it can be\nseen that the learned Magistrate had brought in a distinction in respect\nof S.T.963/2022 and refused to recall the warrant on noticing the failure\nof the petitioner to take bail in the said case. As rightly pointed out by\nthe learned Public Prosecutor, the said order cannot be said to be\nperverse, warranting interference of this Court. Therefore, | decline to\ninterfere with Annexure A4 order.\n\n5. On noticing the disinclination of this Court to interfere with\nAnnexure A4 order, learned Counsel for the petitioner sought time to\nappear before the Court to take bail and requested for keeping the\ncoercive proceedings in abeyance, lest petitioner be put to serious\nprejudice.\n\n6. Considering the old age of the petitioner and also the limited\nrelief now pressed by the learned Counsel for the petitioner, this Court is\nof the opinion that coercive proceedings can be kept in abeyance to\nenable the petitioner to appear before the learned Magistrate without\nfear.\n\n7. Hence while declining to interfere with Annexure A4 order, this\nCourt directs the Non Bailable Warrant issued in S.T.N0.963/2022 to be\nkept in abeyance for a period of 15 days from today, within which\nperiod petitioner shall appear before the learned Magistrate and apply\nfor recall of warrant and for grant of bail. On such application being filed,\n\naa\nie seni\n2024/KER/4635\nCRL.MC NO. 355 OF 2024\n5\nthe same shall be considered by the learned Magistrate on the same day\nitself.\nThe Cril.MC is disposed of as above.\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\n\njm/\n\nBiel\n5 rae\nein eee\n2024/KER/4635\nCRL.MC NO. 355 OF 2024\n6\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 355/2024\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES\nAnnexure A-1 TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER DATED 9-1-24 IN CMP\nNO. 317 OF 2024 IN S.T NO. 988 OF 2021 PASSED\nBY THE COURT OF SPECIAL JUDICIAL FIRST CLASS\nMAGISTRATE VII (NI ACT CASES), KOZHIKODE\nAnnexure A-2 TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER DATED 9-1-24 IN CMP\nNO. 319 OF 2024 IN S.T NO. 700 OF 2022 PASSED\nBY THE COURT OF SPECIAL JUDICIAL FIRST CLASS\nMAGISTRATE VII (NI ACT CASES), KOZHIKODE\nAnnexure A-3 TRUE COPY OF THE CMP NO. 321 OF 2024 FILED BY\nTHE PETITIONER IN S.
