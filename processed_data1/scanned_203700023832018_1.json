CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 08.01.2019,\nTHE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\na\nCrl.MC.No. 2383 of 2018 2O1MKER/SI3\n2\nORDER\n\nThis petition is filed under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C.\n\n2. The petitioner herein is the accused in Crime No.108 of\n2018 registered at the Edakkad Police Station. He faces accusation\nfor having committed offence punishable under Sections 370(1) and\n376 of the IPC.\n\n3. The 2\" respondent is the de facto complainant and the 3\"\nrespondent is his daughter. In the complaint lodged on 06.02.2018,\nhe would state that his daughter is a married woman and her\nhusband is employed in Gulf. His daughter used to be moody and\nstarted showing suicidal tendencies. On 6.2.2018, she went to her\nCollege for attending exams. At noon, the wife of the de facto\ncomplainant was informed by her teacher that her daughter was not\nseen around. She immediately contacted the 3 respondent, who\ngave some excuses. In the evening, the 3 respondent called her\nmother up and told her that she was going to a distant place and\nasked her not to make any inquiries. She was also told that she\nwould commit suicide if any attempt is made to trace her\nwhereabouts. The 2\"? respondent rushed to the Police and lodged a\n\na\n\nCrl.MC.No. 2383 of 2018 2O1MKER/SI3\n3\n\ncomplaint, based on which a crime was registered initially under\nSection 57 of the Kerala Police Act, 2011. Later, the 3\" respondent\nwas traced out. She is alleged to have stated to the police that the\npetitioner had taken her to Bangalore and she was subjected to\nrape. Sections were altered and graver offences were incorporated\nas above.\n\n4. The learned Senior counsel appearing for the petitioner\nsubmitted that the true facts are otherwise. The 3 respondent was\na mature adult woman and she was in a relationship with the\npetitioner. She had voluntarily gone with the petitioner and they had\nstayed at Bangalore. This fact is evident from the First Information\nStatement itself. When she was traced out, she was made to state a\nfalse version to implicate the petitioner. According to the learned\nSenior counsel, the relationship that the petitioner and the 3\"\nrespondent was consensual. It is further submitted that in the\ncourse of proceedings, the de facto complainant and his daughter\nhas come forward and have filed separate affidavits stating that the\nCrime was registered due to the circumstances prevailing then. The\ndaughter of the de facto complainant was a married woman and\nwhen she had eloped with the petitioner, they had no other option to\n\na\nCrl.MC.No. 2383 of 2018 2O1MKER/SI3\n4\nget the Crime registered on the said allegations. It is further\nsubmitted that the party respondents have no further grievance and\nthey are desirous of terminating the proceedings as the petitioner\nherein is innocent.\n\n5. The learned counsel appearing for the respondents 2 and\n3 submitted that the incident which took place on 6.2.2018 is best\nforgotten. The 3\" respondent is now living a contended life with her\nhusband and the entire disputes between her and the petitioner has\nbeen resolved. Heavy reliance is placed on the affidavits filed by the\nparty respondents. It is submitted that if the proceedings are\npermitted to continue it may cause disruption in the matrimonial life\nof the 3 respondent and will result in gross hardship.\n\n6. The learned Public Prosecutor would submitted that the\nstatement of the victim had recorded and she has given certain\njustification for furnishing a distorted statement before the police\nafter she was traced out.\n\n7. I have considered the submissions advanced and have\nperused the materials on record. Annexure-1 is the FIR lodged at\nthe instance of the 2â„¢ respondent herein and it is evident that his\n\na\n\nCrl.MC.No. 2383 of 2018 2O1MKER/SI3\n5\n\nspecific case was that his married daughter had left the home on her\nown. After she was traced out, she had stated that she had gone to\nBangalore with the petitioner herein with whom she was having a\nrelationship. Now both the de facto complainant as well as the\nvictim have come forward and have filed separate affidavits\nasserting the circumstances under which the Crime was registered\nand contending that they have no further grievance. In Annexure-\nA5 and A6 affidavits, they state that they are not desirous of\nprosecuting the petitioner.\n\n8. The legal position with regard to quashing of proceedings\non the basis of compromise between the parties is by now well\nsettled. It has been held that the power of the High Court in\nquashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaint in exercise of its\ninherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given to\na criminal Court for compounding the offences under Section 320 of\nthe Code. In what cases power to quash the criminal proceeding or\ncomplaint or FIR may be exercised where the offender and victim\nhave settled their dispute would depend on the facts and\ncircumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed.\nHowever, before exercise of such power, the Court will have to give\n\na\nCrl.MC.No. 2383 of 2018 2O1MKER/SI3\n6\n\ndue regard to the nature and gravity of the crime. It is also settled\nthat heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offences\nlike murder, rape, dacoity, etc., cannot quashed even though the\nvictim or victim's family and the offender have settled the dispute.\nSuch offenses are not private in nature and have serious impact on\nsociety. The directions of the Apex Court in Gian Singh v. State of\nPunjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303] and in Narinder singh v. State of\nPunjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466 ] serve as guiding lights.\n\n9. Insofar as the offence of rape is concerned, there cannot\nbe any doubt that the same cannot be settled on the strength of a\ncompromise arrived at between the victim and the accused. The\nApex Court in State of M.P. v. Madan Lal [2015 (7) SCC 681],\nrelying on the decision in Shimbhu_and Another v. State of\nHaryana [2014 (13) SCC 318] has clearly reminded the Courts that\nrape is a non-compoundable offence and it is an offence against the\nsociety and is not a matter to be left for the parties to compromise\nand settle. This was because of the fact that the Court cannot\nalways be assured that the consent given by the victim in\ncompromising the case is a genuine consent. There is every chance\nthat the victim might have been pressurised by the convicts or the\n\na\n\nCrl.MC.No. 2383 of 2018 2O1MKER/SI3\n7\n\ntrauma undergone by her all the years might have compelled her to\nopt for a compromise. In such cases, the accused may use all his\ninfluence to pressurise the victim for a compromise. It was taking\nnote of this aspect that it was held that it would not be safe in\nconsidering the compromise arrived at between the parties in rape\ncases.\n\n10. However, the facts in the instant case are otherwise. The\nparties were in a relationship and the 3 respondent was a married\nwoman. Now they have settled their entire disputes and the de\nfacto complainant has now joined her husband. This is not one of\nthose cases wherein the allegations reek of extreme depravity,\nperversity or cruelty. It cannot be said that the offence in the instant\ncase would fall in the category of offences that have a serious\nimpact on society. In the peculiar facts of the instant case, grave\nhardship and inconvenience will be caused to the 3% respondent, if\nthe prosecution is permitted to continue. In that view of the matter,\nthe prospects of an ultimate conviction is remote and bleak even if\nthe case is proceeded with. Furthermore, the 3% respondent can\ncontinue with her life with dignity and respect. Having considered\nall the relevant circumstances, I am of the considered view that\n\nBats hal\noe\nBee\nCrl.MC.No. 2383 of 2018 2019/KERISI3\n8\nthis is a fit case in which this Court will be well justified in invoking\nits extraordinary powers under Section 482 of the Code to quash\nthe proceedings.\n\nIn the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-Ai FIR\nin Crime No.i08 of 2018 of the Edakkad Police Station and all\nproceedings pursuant thereto against the petitioner are quashed.\n\nSD/-\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN V.,\nJUDGE\n//TRUE COPY// P.A.
