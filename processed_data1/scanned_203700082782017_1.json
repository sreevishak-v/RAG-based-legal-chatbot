A. TO JUDGE\nPn\n\nBeuen\n2018/KER/721\nSUNIL THOMAS, J.\n\n8417, 8429, 8428, 8402 & 8405 of 2017\nDated this the 8\" day of January, 2018\nORDER\n\nThese Crl.M.Cs. arise from C.C. No.879/2012 of the\nAdditional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Thiruvananthapuram,\nC.C. No.1033/2014, C.C. No.808/2012, FIR No.490/2014, C.C.\nNo.1917/2013, C.C. No.804/2014, 1119/2014, C.C. No.1228/2012\n& C.C.1916/2013, all of Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,\nThiruvalla.\n\n2. Essentially, the disputes between the husband and\nwife arising out of a matrimonial discord, have triggered the\nabove nine criminal cases. It seems that the matrimonial\nrelationship between the husband and wife ended in a failure,\nleading to filing of a criminal complaint before the Chief Judicial\nMagistrate Court, Thiruvananthapuram alleging matrimonial\ncruelty. This led to registration of C.C.No.879/2012 for offences\npunishable under Sections 498A & 34 IPC. Other rival claims\nbetween the parties are the subject matter of the other criminal\ncases. Out of the above, 3 cases are instituted at the instance of\nthe mother-in-law of the wife and 3 by the wife. It seems that\n\nE\n2018/KER/721\nCri. M. C. Nos. 8278, 8279, 8280, 8281, 8417, 8429, 8428, 8402 & 8405 of 2017\nthere were other matrimonial proceedings pending before the\nFamily Courts.\n\n3. Pending O.P. No.961/2012 of the Family Court\nThiruvalla, the disputes were settled and a compromise was filed\nbefore that court as Annexure A2. Annexure A2 discloses that all\nthe disputes between the parties were amicably settled and the\nparties resolved to give a quietus to the various criminal and\nother proceedings pending between them. Paragraph 8 and 9 of\nthe above proceedings relate to the specific criminal cases\npending between the parties. The above settlement was\naccepted by the Family Court and Annexure A3 judgment was\npassed by the court, recording the settlement. It is stated that\nthe parties have thereafter resolved all other disputes and\nseparate orders were passed in the matrimonial proceedings.\n\n4.  (Cri.M.Cs. are filed by the petitioners contending that in\nthe light of the settlement between the parties, no purpose will be\nserved by prosecuting the accused and the copy of the\ncompromise has been filed in each of the above case.\n\n5. The learned Public Prosecutors on_ instructions\nsubmitted that the statement of the respective de facto\n\nE\n\n2018/KER/721\nCri. M. C. Nos. 8278, 8279, 8280, 8281, 417, 8429, 8428, 8402 & 8405 of 2017\ncomplainants have been recorded in six cases and the Police were\ninformed about the settlement of the remaining three criminal\ncases also. Both the counsel for the petitioners and the learned\ncounsel for the contesting respondents submitted that in the light\nof the settlement between the parties evidenced by Annexure A2,\nthe respective de facto complainants do not propose to pursue\ntheir respective criminal cases.\n\n6. Having considered the rival claims, the fact that the\ndispute between the parties arose from a matrimonial discord\nwhich has now been settled amicably and that all other\nmatrimonial proceedings have been brought to its logical\nconclusion, | feel that no purpose will be served by prosecuting\nthe accused. The law is settled that in matrimonial disputes, the\ncourt shall accept the settlement between the parties and shall\ngive quietus to the criminal cases arising from matrimonial\ndisputes. Hence, | feel that no purpose will be served by\nprosecuting the respective accused and the criminal cases are\nliable to be brought to an end.\n\nAccordingly, Crl.M.Cs. are allowed. All further proceedings in\nC.C. No.879/2012 of the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate Court,\n\nBEE\narate\nope\n2018/KER/721\nCri. M. C. Nos. 8278, 8279, 8280, 8281, 8417, 8429, 8428, 8402 & 8405 of 2017\n4\nThiruvananthapuram, C.C. No.1033/2014, C.C. No.808/2012, FIR\nNo.490/2014, C.C. No.1917/2013, C.C. No.804/2014, 1119/2014,\nC.C. No.1228/2012 & C.C.1916/2013 all of Judicial First Class\nMagistrate Court, Thiruvalla stand quashed.\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE.\nPn\n\n"
