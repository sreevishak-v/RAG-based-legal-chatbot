The offences involved in this case are under Sections\n147, 148, 447, 427, 324 and 506(2) r/w 149 of the Indian Penal\nCode. The original accused Nos.2 and 5 faced trial before the trial\ncourt and obtained a judgment of acquittal under Section 248(1) of\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure when all the material witnesses\nincluding the de facto complainant turned hostile to the\nprosecution in view of an amicable settlement made by the parties\nout of court. The prosecution examined four witnesses in the said\ncase including de facto complainant and also marked Ext.P1. None\nof the material witnesses examined in the case supported the\nprosecution. In such a circumstance, examination of the others\nwas dispensed with, and evidenced was closed by the trial court.\nIn the absence of any evidence or incriminating circumstance, the\nlearned trial Magistrate acquitted the accused Nos.2 and 5. The\ncase against the petitioner herein was split up and refiled as C.C\nNo. 904/2008 and it is now transferred to the register of long\npending cases as L.P No.166/2011 before the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate Court, Malappuram. The petitioner now seeks orders\nquashing the prosecution as against him on the ground that the\n\n2015/KER/2001\n\nCrl.M.C No.257 of 2015 2\n\nvery substratum of the prosecution case is totally lost by the\nacquittal of the others, and continuance of prosecution against him\nwill not serve any purpose. Annexure II judgment in C.C\nNo.604/2007 shows that all the material witnesses examined by the\nprosecution in the said case turned hostile in view of an amicable\nsettlement made by the parties out of court. In such a situation, it\nis quite definite that the prosecution cannot in any manner improve\nthe case, and the witnesses also cannot in any manner help the\nprosecution, if the case against the petitioner goes to trial. In\nshort, such proceeding will be a sheer waste of time.\n\nIn the result, this petition is allowed. The prosecution\nagainst the petitioner in C.C No.904/2008 before the Judicial First\nClass Magistrate Court, Malapuram, which stands transferred to\nthe register of long pending cases as L.P No.166/2011, will stand\nquashed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\nAccordingly, the petitioner will stand released from prosecution,\nand the bail bond, if any, executed by him will stand discharged.\n\nP.UBAID\nJUDGE\nab\n\n"
