No.568/2025\n(Crime No. 172/2025 of Karamana Police Station)\n\nPetitioner/Accused :-\n\nShyny.S Jose, aged 45 years,\n\nD/o Santha, Chairperson/Trustee,\n\nMithram Charitable Trust, TC.52/1604,\n\nThykootam Laksham Veedu,\n\nPlankalamukku, Industrial Estate P.O,\n\nThiruvananthapuram 695019\n\nBy Advocates:-Pallichal S.K. Pramod, Rahul V.R, Arjun.A,\nJayakumar P, Renuka.R and Aswin Rajeev\n\nCounter Petitioner:-\n\nState of Kerala represented by the Station House Officer,\n\nKaramana Police Station\n\nBy Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumary\n\nThis petition came up for hearing on 28/02/2025 and the court on 01/03/2025\n\npassed the following :\nORDER\n\nThis is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik\n\nSuraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail.\nCriminal M.C.No.568/2025 1/7\n\n2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable\nunder Sections 316(2) and 318(4) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, and Crime No.\n172/2025 of Karamana Police Station is registered against the petitioner arraying\nher as the accused.\n\n3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- The accused, with\nan intention to obtain wrongful gain and to cause wrongful loss to the defacto\ncomplainant, offered Scooter for half the price, and on 02.09.2024 at about 4.32\np.m., in the EVM Honda show room situated at Neeramankara, obtained\nRs.67,000/-, by way of Google Pay transaction, from the defacto complainant.\nThereafter, the accused neither gave the scooter as promised nor returned the\nmoney to the defacto complainant, thereby cheated her.\n\n4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The\nInvestigating Officer filed report opposing the anticipatory bail application.\n\n5. Heard. Perused the records.\n\n6. The only point to be considered is, whether an order of anticipatory\nbail can be granted to the petitioner/ accused.\n\nCriminal M.C.No.568/2025 2/7\n\n7. ‘The Point:- The petitioner/accused is the Chair Person of Mithram\nCharitable Trust, Pappanamcode Estate. The petitioner/accused is alleged to have\ncheated the defacto complainant by illegally obtaining money offering Scooter for\nhalf the price, and thereafter, she did not give the scooter to the defacto\ncomplainant as promised or retumed the money to her.\n\n8. The petitioner submitted the following:-\n\nThe petitioner is the Chair Person / Trustee of Mithram\nCharitable Society, a registered Public Charitable Trust established for the benefit\nof general public at large. As part of the project, a new scheme namely women on\nwheels was introduced by the NNGO Confederation, for which, selection of\nbeneficiaries were done through the petitioner’s organization, and the eligible\nbeneficiaries had voluntarily applied through the online link for the scheme of the\nNNGO through their portal by using OTP verification, and the choice of the\nvehicle and its description are also left open to the beneficiaries to choose. As\ninformed by Anantha Kumar and Ananthu Krishnan, the selected beneficiaries are\nbound to remit fifty percent of their share and the rest of the share will be utilized\nfor the CSR Fund, and the amount collected were duly transferred to the accounts\nof the implementing agency of the NNGO namely, Grass Root Impact Foundation,\n\nCriminal M.C.No.568/2025 3/7\n\nProfessional Service Innovations and Socialbee Ventures. Sri. K.N.Anantha\nKumar is a well known personality in the field of charity and the Chairman of\nSathyasai Orphanage Trust. Under his leadership, during May 2022, a meeting of\nthe NGOs was held and a National NGO Confederation was formed. Sri.\nK.N.Anantha Kumar was elected as the life time president of the Confederation,\nAnanthu Krishnan was elected as the National Secretary, and Justice\nC.N.Ramachandran was chosen as the Patron-in-chief of the said N.N.G.O. Wide\npublicity was given by the N.N.G.O. Confederation in respect of their charity\nactivities, and in a meeting of the NGOs of Thiruvananthapuram, called during\nMay 2024 at Sai Gramam, near Thonnakkal, the said persons convinced the\npetitioner and other NGOs that, apart from the beneficiary shares, the remaining\namount will be utilized from the C.S.R. fund for charity projects and schemes. The\nschemes and projects are aimed to uplift the downtrodden women and children in\nthe society. The petitioner’s Organization was also chosen for the implementation\nof the projects and schemes of the NNGO Confederation. Believing the words\nand promises of Anantha Kumar and Anandhu Krishnan, the petitioner bona fidely\nagreed to act as the implementing agency in respect of the schemes. Because of\nthe wide media coverage and propaganda, without proper and preliminary\ninvestigation, the petitioner is arrayed as accused. The petitioner produced copy of\nCriminal M.C.No.568/2025 Al7\n\nthe trust deed, copy of the statement of account, and copy of a petition filed before\nthe Commissioner of Police, Thiruvananthapuram City, against the National\nNNGO, to substantiate her contentions.\n\n9. There is serious allegation as against the petitioner. Allegedly, the\npetitioner had illegally obtained money from the defacto complainant, by offering\nScooter for half the price, and thereafter, she did not give the scooter as promised\nor returned the money to her, and thus cheated her. It is seen from the report filed\nby the Investigating Officer that the investigation is in its preliminary stage. The\nlearned Public Prosecutor submitted that, in this crime, the investigation has not\nstarted yet. It is apparent from the bail application that the petitioner had collected\nRs.67,000/- from the defacto complainant. The case of the petitioner is that, she\nhad remitted the amount so collected, to the account of professional services\nInnovations and Socialbee ventures and Grass Root Impact Foundation, which are\nthe implementing agencies of the National NGO Confederation, and the document\nwas produced. The leamed Public Prosecutor submitted that, in spite of the\ncollection of the amount, no receipt was issued to the defacto complainant when it\nis seen that amount is collected by the petitioner, she owe a liability to fulfill the\npromise. The prosecution has made out a prima facie case against the petitioner/\naccused regarding the involvement of the petitioner in the alleged offence. If the\n\nCriminal M.C.No.568/2025 5/7\n\npetitioner/ accused is granted pre-arrest bail, she is likely to influence or intimidate\nthe defacto complainant and other witnesses, and tamper with the evidence. So,\nthe investigation will be adversely affected. The chance of absconding also cannot\nbe ruled out. Considering the facts stated in the report to the effect that the\npetitioner is involved in the offence, it appears that exceptional jurisdiction to\ngrant a pre-arrest bail cannot be exercised in this case.\n\n10. In Jai Prakash Singh v. State of Bihar and Another (2012 (4) SCC 379),\nthe Apex court has held that, an order of pre-arrest bail being an extra ordinary\nprivilege, should be granted only in exceptional cases. It is settled in law that\narrest should be the last option and it should be restricted to cases where arrest is\nimperative in the facts and circumstances of a case and consistent view is that the\ngrant of anticipatory bail shall be restricted to exceptional circumstances. So it is\nclear that the power to grant anticipatory bail under section 482 of the Bharatiya\nNagarik Suraksha Sanhita. is an exceptional power and should be exercised only in\nexceptional cases and not as a matter of course. Its object is to ensure that a person\nshould not be harassed or humiliated in order to satisfy the grudge or personal\nvendetta of the complainant. [Reliance placed on the decision rendered by the\nApex Court in HDFC Bank Limited v. J.J. Mannan and Another (2010 (1) SCC\n679); Srikant Upadhyay v. State of Bihar (2024 KHC Online 6137)]. In the case\n\nCriminal M.C.No.568/2025 6/7\n\nat hand, I find no exceptional circumstance to exercise the exceptional power of\ngranting anticipatory bail.\n\n11. Considering the serious allegation against the petitioners and gravity\nof the offence, it appears that granting the petitioner with an order of anticipatory\nbail will adversely affect the investigation. If an order of anticipatory bail is\ngranted, she is likely to influence the witnesses and tamper with the evidence.\nConsidering all these aspects, this court is not inclined to grant an order of pre-\narrest bail to the petitioner.\n\nIn the result, this petition is dismissed.\n(Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and\npronounced by me in Open Court on this the 1* day of March 2025)\nSd/-\nNAZEERA.S\nSESSIONS JUDGE\n(Copies : 4) //True Copy// (By Order)\nTyped by: Soumya\nCompared bv:Rifa FCS: SHERISTADAR\nCriminal M.C.No.568/2025 W7\n\nCopy of Order in\nCriminal M.C.No.568/2025\nDated 01/03/2025\nCriminal M.C.No.568/2025 8/7\n\n"
