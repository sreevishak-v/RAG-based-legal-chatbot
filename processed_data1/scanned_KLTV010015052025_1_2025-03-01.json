No.636/2025\n(Crime No. 1846/2024 of Varkala Police Station, pending before Judicial First\nClass Magistrate Court-I, Varkala)\nPetitioner/Accused No.5 :-\nAasher, aged 38 years,\nS/o Nazar, Khadeeja Manzil\nThazhevettoor, Varkala, Thiruvannathapuram\n(By Advocates Vishnu V.H. & Sekhar G. Thampi.)\nCounter Petitioner/ Respondent:-\nState of Kerala represented by Station House Officer,\nVarkala Police Station.\n(By Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumari)\nThis Crl.M.C. came up for hearing on 28/2/2025 and the court on the\n1/3/2025 passed the following :\nORDER\nThis is an application filed by the 5\" accused in the above crime\nunder Section 483 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, seeking\nregular bail.\n\n2. The petitioner/ 5\" accused is alleged to have committed the\noffences punishable under Sections 189(2), 191(2), 191(3), 126(2), 296(b),\n118(1), 249(a) and 103, r/w Section 190 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.\nCriminal M.C.No.636/2025 1/5\n\n3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- Accused Nos.1\nto 4 were in inimical terms, with the uncle of the defacto complainant,\nSri.Shajahan, and his brother-in-law Sri.Rahman. On 24.12.2024 at about\n10.30 p.m., accused Nos.1 to 5 formed themselves into an unlawful assembly\narmed with deadly weapons and in prosecution of their common object,\nwrongfully restrained Shajahan and Rahman, while they were traveling in a\nScooter bearing Registration No. KL-81-A-4115 near the Mosque at Vettoor\nDesom in Vettoor Village. Thereafter, accused No.1 uttered abusive words\nagainst Shajahan and Rahman, and fisted on the face of Rahman, using a\nsteel chain. When Rahman evaded the attack, the same fell upon the face of\nShajahan and he fell down from the vehicle. Then, accused Nos. 2 and 3, by\nusing G.I. pipes, beat Rahman on his left middle finger and left hand muscle,\ncausing injuries. When Shajahan attempted to escape from the scene,\naccused Nos. 1 and 3 beat him, towards his head, using the G.I. pipes causing\ngrievous injury on his head, and the 4\" accused beat Shajahan on his back\nand left leg repeatedly using the blunt portion of a sword and hacked\ntowards his head, using the sword, again causing grievous injury to Shajahan\non his head. Then, accused Nos.2 and 5, by using G.I.Pipe and iron rod, beat\nShajahan on his back and both hand muscles. When the defacto complainant\nand the local people rushed to the spot, the accused left the place. Thereafter,\nCriminal M.C.No.636/2025 2/5\n\nShajahan was taken to Taluk Hospital, Varkala, and from there to the KIMS\nHospital, Thiruvananthapuram for treatment. But, due to the fatal injury\nsustained, Shajahan died at around 11.30 p.m. It is alleged that, after the\nincident, accused Nos. 1 to 4 left the place of occurrence in a Scooter bearing\nRegistration No. KL-81-8468, and another Scooter bearing Reg. No. KL-81-\n8569 owned and ridden by the 6\" accused and went to the house of the\n7\" accused. Accused Nos.6 and 7 screened accused Nos. 1 to 4 from legal\npunishment, knowing that, they have committed the alleged offences.\n\n4. Reportedly, the petitioner’ 5” accused was arrested on\n25.12.2024 and he is in custody since then.\n\n5. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor.\nThe Investigating Officer filed report opposing the bail application.\n\n6. Heard. Perused the records.\n\n7. The only point to be considered is, whether regular bail can be\ngranted to the petitioner/ 5\" accused.\n\n8. The Point:- The petitioner / 5\" accused along with accused\nNos. 1 to 4 is alleged to have brutally attacked one Shajahan and Rahman,\nusing dangerous weapons, and murdered Shajahan. The allegation against\nthe petitioner/5\" accused is that, he had along with the 2™ accused, by using\nG.I.Pipe and Iron rod, beaten Shajahan on his back and both hand muscles,\nCriminal M.C.No.636/2025 3/5\n\nand actively participated in the commission of the offence. The motive for\nthe alleged incident is the enmity that aroused when Shajahan (the deceased),\nShibu and Rahman, the uncles of the defacto complainant, warned the\naccused persons as against their usage of drugs in the premises of Thykkavu\nMosque.\n\n9. According to the petitioner, he is innocent and he has not\ncommitted any offence as alleged by the prosecution. It is also submitted\nthat, the injury, which caused the death of the deceased was not due to the\nalleged overt act by the petitioner.\n\n10. The magnitude of the offence alleged is grave. Allegedly, the\npetitioner/ 5\" accused had actively participated along with the other accused\nin the commission of murder. It is seen from the report filed by the\nInvestigating Officer that the specific overt act alleged against the petitioner\nis that, he along with the 2™ accused had beaten on the back and hand\nmuscles of Shajahan (the deceased) by using a G.I.Pipe and iron rod. It is\nseen from the post-mortem certificate appended with the report that there are\n15 ante-mortem injuries are noted. The First Information Statement was\ngiven by the close relative of the deceased. It is stated in the First\nInformation Statement that one of the relatives of the deceased had seen the\naccused persons committing the offence and he identified the petitioner /\nCriminal M.C.No.636/2025 4/5\n\n5\" accused. It is seen from the report filed by the Investigating Officer that\nthe weapons, mobile phone, vehicles involved in the crime, and the dressses\nworn by the accused persons were recovered. So, the prosecution has made\nout a prima facie case against the petitioner / 5\" accused and regarding the\ninvolvement of the petitioner/ 5\" accused in the alleged offence. The\npetitioner/ 5\" accused is in judicial custody only for a period of 66 days. It\nis stated in the report that the investigation is progressing and accused Nos. 6\nand 7 are yet to be arrested. If the petitioner/ 5\" accused is released on bail at\nthis stage, he is likely to influence or intimidate the defacto complainant and\nother witnesses and tamper with the evidence. So, the investigation will be\nadversely affected. The chance of absconding also cannot be ruled out.\nConsidering the gravity of the offence and the stage of investigation, this\ncourt is not inclined to release the petitioner on bail at this stage.\nIn the result, this petition is dismissed.\n(Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and\npronounced by me in Open Court on this the 1* day of March, 2025)\nSd/-\nNAZEERA.S\nSESSIONS JUDGE\n(Copies : 4) True Copy By Order\nTyped by: Anupama\nCompared by: Rifa FCS: SHERISTADAR\nCriminal M.C.No.636/2025 5/5\n\nCopy of Order in\nCriminal M.C.No.636/2025\nDated 1/3/2025\nCriminal M.C.No.636/2025 6/5\n\n"
