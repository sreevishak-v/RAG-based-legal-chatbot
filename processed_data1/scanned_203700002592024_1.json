Due to the failure of the petitioners to appear before\nthe court, a non bailable warrant was issued against them and\nthe case has even be transferred to the Long Pending Register.\n\n3. Sri. G. Hariharan, the learned counsel contended that,\nthough petitioners are ready and willing to appear before the\ncourt and participate in the trial, since the case has been\ntransferred to the Long Pending Register, there is every\npossibility that the petitioners will be remanded on the date of\ntheir appearance before considering the application.
