CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n08.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nie\nCRL.M.C.NO.5584 OF 2020 ; 202UKER/I361\nORDER\n\nDated this the 8th day of January 2021\n\nPetitioners are accused Nos.1 to 7 in\nCrime No.183/2019 registered at the\nKuruppanpadi Police Station, Ernakulam for\noffences punishable under Sections 341, 323,\n294(b), 143, 147, 149 of IPC, now pending as\nC.C.No.132/2019 on the files of the Judicial\nFirst Class Magistrate Court-III,\nPerumbavoor. The de facto complainants, at\nwhose instance the crime was registered, are\narrayed as the 27¢ and 3** respondents.\nAnnexure-A3 and Annexure-A3 (a) affidavits\nhave been filed by 2™ and 3** respondents\nstating that the dispute, which was the\nreason for the incident and registration of\nthe crime, have been resolved amicably and\nthey have no subsisting grievance against\n\nie\nCRL.M.C.NO.5584 OF 2020 ; 2021/KER/1361\nthe petitioners.\n\n2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor\nalso, who, on instructions, submits that the\npetitioners have no criminal antecedents.\n\n3. Having considered the gravity of the\noffences alleged, nature of the injury\ncaused and having perused the affidavits\nfiled by the 2™ and 3** respondent, the\ncontents of which are submitted to be true\nand voluntary, I am satisfied that the\ndispute is settled and no public interest is\ninvolved in this matter. Moreover, in view\nof the settlement, possibility of the\ncriminal proceedings ending in conviction is\nremote. As such, continuance of the\nproceedings will amount to an abuse of\nprocess of court and hence, in view of the\nlegal position set out by the Honourable\nSupreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State\nof Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh\n\nirae\nCRL.M.C.NO.5584 OF 2020 . 202 1U/KER/1361\nv.
