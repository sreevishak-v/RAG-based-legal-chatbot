JYOTHINDRANATH, J. 20171KER/2076\n~~ CrL.M.C.No.3704 of 2013 _\nDated this the 13\" day of January, 2017\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner is an accused in C.C.No.563/2010 before\nthe Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Vadakara. The\nfacts shorn of unnecessary details are as follows:\n\nThe petitioner is an Assistant Postmaster. During the\nperiod 31.8.2005 to 3.6.2006, he was on the charge of\nPostmaster. During the said period he availed a housing\nloan of Rs.5,25,000/- from Canara Bank, for which, he\nproduced certain documents. When he defaulted the\nrepayments, the Bank authorities contacted the Postal\nSuperintendent and found that the salary certificate\nproduced by the petitioner herein was a forged document.\nThereon, an oral complaint was made by the Senior\nManager of the Canara Bank, Orkkatteri branch before the\npolice. Thereon F.I.R. No.565/2008 for offences under\nSections 420, 468 and 471 of IPC is seen registered. The\nallegation is that for cheating the bank and obtaining the\nloan amount, the forged documents are produced. After\n\npasa\n.\n2017/KER/2076\n\nCrl.M.C.No.3704 of 2013 ,\ninvestigation, a charge was laid and the court took\ncognizance of the offences and took the case on file as\nC.C.No.563/2010 on the files of the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate, Vadakara. Aggrieved by the said action of the\ncourt in taking cognizance on the police charge, this\nCrl.M.C. is filed for quashing the said proceedings.\n\n2. When the petition came up for hearing, the\ncounsel for the petitioner submitted before me that even if\nany offence is committed, that will only an offence under\nSection 13 of P.C. Act and the local police got no\njurisdiction to take cognizance. It is also the submission that\nthe amount has already been remitted and at no stretch of\nimagination can it be said that the salary certificate\nproduced was a forged one, when the petitioner was holding\nthe post of the Postmaster under charge.\n\n3. I have herd the learned Public Prosecutor, who\nsubmitted before me that here is not a case where any loss\nsustained to the postal department. It is also submitted\nbefore me that the officials of the bank never conspired with\n\nbigeesr\n2017/KER/2076\nCrl.M.C.No.3704 of 2013\n3\n\nthe petitioner. Under such circumstances, the loss to the\nbank is nothing to do with any act of the officials employed\n\nby them and as there is no loss to the post office also, an\noffence under Section 13 of P.C. Act is not committed by the\npetitioner.\n\n4. There is force in the submission of the Prosecutor.\nSurely, whether actually a forgery was committed to\ncommit an offence under Section 420 of IPC is a fact to be\nconsidered by the trial court. Surely, the case of the\npetitioner is that he already paid and cleared the loan. This\nbeing a warrant trial case, the petitioner is even entitled to\nargue for a discharge, if so entitled. Thus, untrammeled by\nany of the observations made herein, he is entitled to\ncontest his case before the trial court and even entitled to\nargue for a discharge, if he is so legally entitled.\n\nWith the above observations, this petition dismissed.\n\nSd/-\nK.P. JYYOTHINDRANATH\nJUDGE\n//True copy//\nP.A. TO JUDGE\nshg/\n\n"
