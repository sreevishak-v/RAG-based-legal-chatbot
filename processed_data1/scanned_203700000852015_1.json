Crime in the said case was registered under Sections\n143, 147, 341, 323 and 324 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code, on\nthe complaint of one Praveen. The petitioners now seek orders\nquashing the prosecution as against them on the ground that\nthey and the defacto complainant have amicably settled the\ndispute out of court. The defacto complainant Praveen is the\nsecond respondent in this proceeding. He has filed affidavit to\nthe effect that he has settled the whole dispute with the accused,\nand he has no complaint or grievance now. I am well satisfied\nthat there is a real and genuine settlement between the parties,\nand I find that continuance of prosecution in such a situation will\nnot serve any purpose, other than wasting the precious time of\nthe court. The petitioners seek orders under Section 482 of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure because composition as such is not\npossible.\n\nBiieiaael\nCapea\n2015/KER/783\nCrl.M.C No.85 of 2015 2\nIn the result, this Criminal Miscellaneous Case is\nallowed. The prosecution against the petitioners herein in C.C\nNo.689/2011 before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court I,\nKollam, will stand quashed under Section 482 of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure. Accordingly, the petitioners will stand\nreleased from prosecution, and the bail bond, if any, executed by\nthem will stand discharged.\nP.UBAID\nJUDGE\nab\n\n"
