The aforesaid case has arisen\nfrom Crime No.297 of 2010 of Kuttiadi Police Station\nregistered for the offences punishable under Section 143,\n147, 148, 160, 435, 427 read with Section 149 of the IPC\nand under section 3(2)(e) of the PDPP Act.\n\n2.After investigation, final report was laid before the\njurisdictional Court arraying 30 persons as the accused.\nThe petitioners were arrayed as 14, 22, 24, 26 and 30 in\nthe final report. The petitioners did not appear before the\ncourt below and face the trial. The case was proceeded\nagainst accused Nos.1 to 13, 15 to 21, 23, 25 and 27 to\n29. They were found not guilty by the learned Magistrate\n\nBREE\nsoakensants\n\nCrl.M.C.4162/2016 2\nand were acquitted under section 248(1) of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure. (hereinafter referred to as the\n“Code”).\n\n3.The petitioners have preferred this petition under Section\n482 of the Code seeking to quash the above proceedings\non the ground that the substratum of the case has been\nshattered in view of the acquittal of the co-accused.\n\n4.1 have heard the learned counsel for the petitioners as\nwell as the learned Public Prosecutor.\n\n5.1 have given my _ anxious’ considerations to the\nsubmissions made across the bar and I have also gone\nthrough the materials on record. It is evident from\nAnnexure-II judgment of the court below that none of the\nwitnesses had supported the case of the prosecution. The\nlearned Additional Sessions Judge after evaluating the\nprosecution evidence in a meticulous manner concluded\nthat there is no evidence to connect the accused with the\ncrime. The prosecution witnesses had gone to the extent\n\nBREE\nsoakensants\n\nCrl.M.C.4162/2016 3\nof testifying that they were unaware as to the identity of\nthe persons who attacked them. These observations,\nwould definitely affect the very substratum of the\nprosecution case. As held by this Court in Moosa v. Sub\nInspector of Police (2006 (1) KLT 552), though the\nreasoning of the judgment contained or appreciation of\nevidence in the case of a co-accused therein are not\ngrounds to attract any relief under Section 482 of the\nCode, a case where the substratum of the case is lost is\nan exception to the above rule.\n\n6.1 am of the firm view that no purpose is going to be\nserved by directing the petitioners to face the trial at this\nstage. It can only be a futile exercise and the only\npurpose that will be served is to gnaw into precious time\nduring which more productive work can be done by the\ncourt below. The prospects of conviction is extremely\nremote owing to the acquittal of the co accused.\n\nIn the result, this petition is allowed. The proceedings\n\nRERAaE\nbishan\n2016/KER/34118\nCrl.M.C.4162/2016 4\nas against the petitioners in C.C.No.261 of 2014 on the file\nof the Judicial Magistrate of First Class Court, Payyoli are\nquashed.\nSd/-\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.Y.\nJUDGE\nvps\n\n"
