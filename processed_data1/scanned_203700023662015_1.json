To Judge\nDSV/6/1/16\n\n2016/KER/47\nB. KEMAL PASHA, J.\nORDER\n\nHeard the learned counsel for the petitioners, the\nlearned counsel for the 2 respondent and the learned\nPublic Prosecutor.\n\n2. What is under challenge is the Final Report in\nC.C.No.784 of 2014 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate's\nCourt, Nedumkandom, which has arisen from Crime No.812\nof 2014 of the Nedumkandom Police Station, for the\noffences under Section 277 IPC and Section 120(e) of the\nKerala Police Act, 2011.\n\n2016/KER/47\nCRL.M.C.No.2366 of 2015 uoe\n\n3. As per the Final Report, the allegation against the\npetitioners is that they had, with the intention of polluting the\ndrinking water of the 2\" respondent, being obtained from his\nwell, directed waste water into the property of the 2”\nrespondent by causing the over flow of a pipe, which was\ninstalled by them, through the drainage, after filling the\ndrainage with soil. It is alleged that the waste water has\nbecome over flown from the pipe on account of the\nunprecedented heavy rainfall and it went on to the property\nof the 2™ respondent, which has polluted the water in the\nwell of the 2\"? respondent.\n\n4. At any stretch of imagination, an offence under\nSection 277 IPC cannot be attracted in the matter as the\nproperty and the well in question are not public properties.\nWith regard to the offence under Section 120(e) of the\nKerala Police Act, 2011, it has to be noted that in order to\ninvite such an offence, the accused has to cause defiling of\nwater source or water supply or cause hindrance to public\n\n2016/KER/47\nCRL.M.C.No.2366 of 2015 uae\nsanitation etc. On going through the allegations, it is evident\nthat any of the provisions contained in Section 120(e) of the\nKerala Police Act, 2011 cannot be attracted to the present\nmatter.\n\n5. Precisely, the allegation is that on account of\nunprecedented torrential rain, some water has over flown\nfrom the pipe installed. There are no ingredients to invite\nthe offences alleged against the petitioners in the matter.\n\n6. Matters being so, the continued prosecution based\non C.C.No.784 of 2014 of the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate's Court, Nedumkandom is quite unnecessary and\ntherefore, all further proceedings in C.C.No.784 of 2014 of\nthe Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court, Nedumkandom,\nwhich has arisen from Crime No.812 of 2014 of the\nNedumkandom Police Station, as against the petitioners,\ncan be quashed.\n\nIn the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and all further\nproceedings in C.C.No.784 of 2014 of the Judicial First\n\nee\napa\n2016/KER/47\nCRL.M.C.No.2366 of 2015\n-4:-\nClass Magistrate's Court, Nedumkandom, which has arisen\nfrom Crime No.812 of 2014 of the Nedumkandom Police\nStation, as against the petitioners, are hereby quashed.\nSd/-\nB.
