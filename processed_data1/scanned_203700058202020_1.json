The said\nvehicle was seized by the 3 respondent on\n01.12.2020 on the allegation of having used the\nvehicle for conversion of paddy land in violation of the\nprovisions of the Kerala Conservation of Paddy Land\nand Wet Land Act, 2008. The grievance of the\npetitioner is that respondents 2 to 4 failed to report\nthe seizure of the vehicle to the jurisdictional\nMagistrate Court. The petitioner rely on Section\n102(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure to contend\nthat the respondents 2 to 4 are duty bound to report\nthe seizure to the jurisdictional Magistrate Court,\nfailing which the petitioner will be denied an\nopportunity to move for interim custody under Section\n\nCrl.MC.No.5820 OF 2020 (F) Be. 202 1/KER/T387\n451 CrPC.\n\n2. l heard the learned Public Prosecutor also. The\nlearned Public Prosecutor submits that the vehicle\nwas seized by the 3™ respondent as directed by the 4™\nrespondent and handed over to the Police for custody.\n\nI find merit in the contention that, having seized\nthe vehicle, the respondents 2 to 4 are bound to\nreport the seizure to the jurisdictional Magistrate\nCourt. Accordingly, the Crl.M.C is disposed of with the\nfollowing directions;\n\n(i) The competent among respondents 2\n\nto 4 shall report seizure of the vehicle\n\nbearing registration No.KL-40-D-2221\n\ncovered by Annexure-I to the jurisdictional\n\nMagistrate Court within one week of\n\nreceipt of a copy of a copy of this judgment.\n\n(ii) On such report being submitted,\n\nPeete\nCr1.MC.No.5820 OF 2020(F) AL, 202UKERII387\n\nthe petitioner shall be at liberty to submit\napplication seeking interim custody of the\n\nvehicle.\n\n(iii) The application for interim custody, if\n\nany filed, shall be considered by the\njurisdictional Magistrate and appropriate\n\norders passed without delay.\n\nSd/-\nV.G.ARUN\n5B/08/01/2021 JUDGE\n\nPate\nA\neee\nCrl.MC.No.5820 OF 2020(F) Be. 2021/KER/1387\nAPPENDIX OF Crl1.MC 5820/2020\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE 1 TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER DATED\n20/10/2020 IN CRL.
