CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n12.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING :\n\nBal SrsieRs Tal\nBSN\n2024/KER/2388\nCRL.MC NO. 313 OF 2024\n2\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.\n~ GrLLM.C.No.313 of 2024\nDated this the 12\" day of January, 2024\nORDER\n\nPetitioner challenges Annexure A3 order in Crl.M.P.No.3002 of 2023\nin Crl.A.No.93 of 2023 on the files of the Sessions Court, Thodupuzha.\n\n2. By virtue of the impugned order, the learned Sessions Judge\nwhile suspending the sentence imposed upon the petitioner, directed\ndeposit of 20% of the amount of fine/ compensation imposed by the trial\ncourt in S.T.No.20 of 2016 on the files of the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate's Court-II, Thodupuzha.\n\n3. Sri.Denny Varghese, the learned counsel for the petitioner\ncontended that the direction to deposit 20% of the fine amount is too\nonerous a condition to be imposed under Section 148(1) of the Negotiable\nInstruments Act, 1881 (for short, 'the NI Act') as the petitioner, is a\nhousewife having no income and therefore, it is impossible for her to raise\nthe huge amount of more than 17 lakhs for complying with the direction.\n\n4. I have heard Smt.Sreeja V., the learned Public Prosecutor as\nwell.\n\n5. The learned Sessions Judge has imposed only the minimum\namount specified in Section 148(1) of the NI Act. In the decision in\nSurinder Singh Deswai v. Virender Gandhi [(2020) 2 SCC 514], the\nSupreme Court has observed that the object of the NI Act will be defeated\n\nBal SrsieRs Tal\nBSN\n2024/KER/2388\nCRL.MC NO. 313 OF 2024\n3\n\nif unscrupulous drawers fails to pay the amount and drag the case for a\nlong period. The purpose of providing a deposit of a percentage of the\nsum involved as a condition to suspend the sentence is a means to\nprevent the payees from being subjected to irreparable prejudice.\n\n6. In the instant case, a perusal of Annexure Al judgment reveals\nthat the petitioner is alleged to have stood as a guarantor to the chitty\ntransaction of her husband who received more than Rs.55 lakhs under a\nchitty in the year 2013. For the last almost 9 years, no amounts\nallegedly due under the cheque have been paid by the petitioner. In such\ncircumstances, I am of the view that the direction to pay 20% is\nreasonable and there is no infirmity with the impugned order. Being a\nhousewife cannot be a reason to avoid the condition for payment.\n\nSince the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the time\nto pay the amounts will expire tomorrow (13.01.2024), I am of the view\nthat taking note of the circumstances pointed out by the learned counsel,\nthe time to deposit can be extended by a further sixty days from today.\n\nWith the above observation, the Crl.M.C. is dismissed.\n\nSd/-\nRKM BECHU KURIAN THOMAS, JUDGE\n\npues\nTestes\nos\n2024/KER/2388\nCRL.MC NO. 313 OF 2024\n4\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 313/2024\nPETITIONER'S ANNEXURES :\nAnnexure Al TRUE COPY OF THE JUDGMENT DATED\n12.10.2023 PRONOUNCED BY THE JUDICIAL\nFIRST-CLASS MAGISTRATE COURT - II,\nTHODUPUZHA IN S.T NO. 20/2016\nAnnexure A2 TRUE COPY OF CRL.
