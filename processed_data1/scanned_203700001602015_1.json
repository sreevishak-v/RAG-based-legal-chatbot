On the apprehension of arrest and remand to\njudicial custody on surrender, the petitioner seeks a direction\nfrom this Court under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure, to the court below to release him on bail, on\nappropriate conditions. The offences involved are under\nSections 406 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code.\n\n3. The learned counsel submits that the petitioner\nhas already settled all the claims with some other persons and\nearnest efforts are now being made to settle the whole dispute.\nIt is also submitted that the transaction alleged in the final\nreport is in fact a civil transaction having only civil\nconsequences. Anyway, these aspects will have to be looked into\nby the learned Magistrate when the application for bail is\nconsidered. The learned Magistrate who has issued warrant of\narrest for proper and legal reasons will have to consider the\n\nDir ee\n2015/KER/1262\n\nCrl.M.C No.160 of 2015 2\n\npetitioner's request and pass appropriate orders. I do not think\nthat the learned Magistrate will mechanically remand him to\njudicial custody without hearing his grievance and without\nunderstanding the facts of the case. However, a direction can be\ngiven to the court below to dispose of the application without\ndelay.\n\nIn the result, this Criminal Miscellaneous Case is\nclosed with direction to the court below that if application for\nbail is filed by the petitioner on surrender in C.C No.315/2014, it\nshall be judiciously considered, and appropriate orders shall be\npassed, on the date of surrender itself, however with notice to\nthe other side.\n\nP.UBAID\nJUDGE\nab\n\n"
