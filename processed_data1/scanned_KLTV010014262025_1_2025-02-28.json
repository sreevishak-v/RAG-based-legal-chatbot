NAZEERA:S, SESSIONS JUDGE\nOn Friday, 28\" day of February 2025/9\" day of Phalguna, 1946.\nCriminal M.C.No. 595/2025\n(Crime No. 57/2025 of Poonthura Police Station)\nPetitioner/Accused No 7 :-\n\nSuneer Muhammed A S aged 22 years\n\nS/o. Abdul Samad KK, TC 43/986\n\nParuthikuzhy Manacaud Thiruvananthapuram\n\nBy Advocates:- Salini TS\nCounter Petitioner _:-\n\nState of Kerala represented by\n\nStation House Officer Poonthura Police Station\n\nBy Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumari\n\nThis Criminal M.C. is coming on for hearing on 25.02.2025 and the court\non 28.02.2025 passed the following :\n\nORDER\n\nThis is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik\nSuraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail.\n\n2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable\nunder Sections 189(2), 191(2), 296(b), 115(2), 118(1), 118(@) and 110, r/w\nSection 190 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, and Crime No. 57/2025 of\nPoonthura Police Station is registered against the petitioner arraying him as the\n7™ accused.\n\n2\n\n3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- On 14.01.2025 at\nabout 11 p.m., at Paruthikkuzhi Junction in Muttathara Village, the accused, six\nin numbers, formed themselves into an unlawful assembly and assaulted the\nfriend of defacto complainant. When the defacto complainant prevented the\nattack, the 1* accused uttered obscene words against him and fisted on his left\ncheek. Then, accused Nos. 2 to 5 uttered obscene words against the defacto\ncomplainant and fisted and kicked him all over his body. When the defacto\ncomplainant fell down, the 2™ accused, by using a granite piece, hit him on his\nleft eye, causing fracture to his bone, and again attempted to hit on his head,\nwhich was evaded by the defacto complainant.\n\n4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor.\nThe Investigating Officer filed report opposing the bail application.\n\n5. Heard. Perused the records.\n\n6. The only point to be considered is, whether pre-arrest bail can be\ngranted to the petitioner/ 7\" accused.\n\n7. The Point:- The defacto complainant is an autorickshaw driver.\nAs per the allegations, while the defacto complainant was driving his\nautorickshaw, he had seen around six accused manhandling one Nazeeb, and\nwhen he interfered and obstructed the attack, the accused persons attacked the\ndefacto complainant, causing injuries.\n\n3\n\n8. The petitioner submits that, he is a student, and his name is not in\nthe First Information Report. It is submitted that, the petitioner is innocent of\nthe allegations levelled against him and he has been falsely implicated in this\ncase.\n\n9. The magnitude of the offence alleged is grave. Allegedly, the\ndefacto complainant was attacked by the accused persons when he obstructed\nthe act of the accused persons in manhandling the friend of the defacto\ncomplainant. The specific overt act alleged against the petitioner / 7\" accused is\nthat, he had abused the defacto complainant and fisted and hit him on various\nparts of his body. It is seen from the body note appended with the First\nInformation Statement that, there was swelling on the left eye of the defacto\ncomplainant. The treatment certificate produced along with the report shows\nthat the defacto complainant had sustained closed glob injury on the left eye and\nfracture to his posterolateral wall, floor of left orbit involving extracornal retro-\norbital space. So, there is corresponding injuries. So, the prosecution has made\nout a prima facie case against the petitioner/ 7\" accused and regarding the\ninvolvement of the petitioner in the alleged offence. It is stated in the report\nthat the 6\" accused is yet to be arrested. The investigation is progressing.\nConsidering the facts stated in the report to the effect that the petitioner is\ninvolved in the offence, it appears that exceptional jurisdiction to grant a pre-\narrest bail cannot be exercised in this case.\n\n4\n\n10. In Jai Prakash Singh v. State of Bihar and Another (2012 (4)\nSCC 379), the Hon’ble Apex court has held that, an order of pre-arrest bail\nbeing an extra ordinary privilege, should be granted only in exceptional cases. It\nis settled in law that arrest should be the last option and it should be restricted to\ncases where arrest is imperative in the facts and circumstances of a case and\nconsistent view is that the grant of anticipatory bail shall be restricted to\nexceptional circumstances. So it is clear that the power to grant anticipatory bail\nunder section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita is an exceptional\npower and should be exercised only in exceptional cases and not as a matter of\ncourse. Its object is to ensure that a person should not be harassed or humiliated\nin order to satisfy the grudge or personal vendetta of the complainant. [Reliance\nplaced on the decision rendered by the Hon’ble Apex Court in HDFC Bank\nLimited v. J.J. Mannan and Another (2010 (1) SCC 679); Srikant Upadhyay\nv. State of Bihar (2024 KHC Online 6137)]. In the case at hand, I find no\nexceptional circumstance to exercise the exceptional power of granting\nanticipatory bail.\n\n11. Considering the serious allegation against the petitioner and gravity\nof the offence, it appears that granting the petitioner with an order of\nanticipatory bail will adversely affect the investigation. If an order of\nanticipatory bail is granted, he is likely to influence the witnesses and tamper\n\n5\nwith the evidence. Considering all these aspects, this court is not inclined to\ngrant an order of pre-arrest bail to the petitioner.\nIn the result, this petition is dismissed.\nDictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and\npronounced by me in Open Court on this the 28\" day of February, 2025.\nNAZEERA S.\nSESSIONS JUDGE\n\nCopies (4)\n\nTyped by : Manjusha\n\nComp by : Soumya\n\nFCS :\n\n6\nFair Copy of order in\nCrl MC No. 595/2024\nDated: 28.02.2024\n\n"
