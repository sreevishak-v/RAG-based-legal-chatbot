TO JUDGE\npk\n\nBeal\n2015/KER/17577\nP. UBAID, J.\nDated this the 5\" day of May, 2015\nORDER\nThe petitioners herein are the accused in C.C.1586/2014\nof the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Wadakkanchery.\nThey seek orders quashing the prosecution on the ground of\namicable settlement of the whole dispute between them and\nthe de facto complainant. Crime in this case was registered\nunder Sections 323, 354, 498(A), 506(1) and 294(b) read with\n149 IPC on the complaint of one Soumya, who is the 2\"\nrespondent in this proceeding brought under Section 482 of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure. She has filed affidavit to the effect\nthat she has settled the whole dispute with the accused and\nshe has no grievance or complaint now.\n\n2. In so many decisions, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has\nheld that even in cases involving non-compoundable offences,\nthe High Court can quash the prosecution in pending\nproceedings, if the parties have really settled the whole dispute\namicably out of court, and continuance of prosecution will not\nserve any purpose in such a circumstance of amicable\nsettlement. Here, | find areal and genuine case of settlement\n\nneeae\n2015/KER/17577\n\nCri.M.C. No.2526 of 2015 2\n\nbetween the parties. This is not a case involving any public\ninterest or public issue. The parties have come to terms\namicably on the intervention of persons acceptable to both\nsides, and | am satisfied that the parties are now on quite\ncordial terms. In such a_ situation, continuance of the\nprosecution will not serve any purpose other than wasting the\nprecious time of the court. No doubt, nobody will support the\nprosecution in such a situation, if the case goes to trial.\n\nIn the result, this petition is allowed. The prosecution\nagainst the petitioners herein in C.C.1586/2014 of the Judicial\nFirst Class Magistrate Court, Wadakkanchery will stand\nquashed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\nAccordingly, the petitioners will stand released from\nprosecution and the bail bond, if any, executed by them will\nstand discharged.\n\nSd/-\nP. UBAID, JUDGE\nsd\n\n"
