The aforesaid crime was\nregistered on 11.7.2013 against the petitioner and two\nothers alleging offence punishable under Sections 56(b),\n55(a) and (i) of the Abkari Act, 1 of 1077 (hereinafter\nreferred to as the ‘Act 1 of 1077' for brevity ).\n\n2.The prosecution allegation, as is borne out from the\nearliest records, is that on 11.7.2013, the Sub Inspector\nof Police, Pulinkunnu Police Station, while on routine\npatrol duty, received reliable information that Indian Made\nForeign Liquor (IMFL) was being sold in the toddy shop\nbearing T.S.No.76 of Thonnuchira. He along with his\nsubordinate officers inspected the toddy shop and found\ntwo persons, allegedly the Manager and salesman, selling\n\n2016/KER/33657\n\nCrl.M.C.3269/2013 2\nIMFL. His inspection further revealed that they had\nstored, for the purpose of sale, 8 bottles of brandy and\none bottle of rum. A sum of Rs.250/- and some glasses\nand soda were also found inside the room. The items\nwere seized as per Annexure-II mahazar and Annexure-I\ncrime was registered as aforesaid on 11.7.2013 alleging\noffences punishable under Section 55 (a), 55 (i) and under\n56 (b) of the Abkari Act. The petitioner is arrayed in his\ncapacity as the licensee of the toddy shop.\n\n3.The instant petition was filed on 2.8.2013 itself,\ncontending that the allegations in the FIR was inherently\nimprobable and absurd and the petitioner prays that the\nproceedings be quashed invoking the extraordinary\ninherent powers of this Court.\n\n4.In the course of proceedings, an application to implead\nhimself in the instant proceeding was filed by the\nadditional 5™ respondent claiming that he was also\ninterested in the outcome of the matter. It was asserted\nthat after the registration of the crime, the privilege\n\n2016/KER/33657\nCrl.M.C.3269/2013 3\ngranted to the petitioner was canceled and the toddy shop\nwas re-auctioned. He had participated in the auction and\nbecame the successful bidder. A see-saw battle for the\nprivilege of running the toddy shop in pursuance to the\nauction ensued between the petitioner and the 5\"\nrespondent before various authorities and also this Court.\nThe petitioner herein finally emerged successful before the\nExcise Commissioner and it was held that he would have a\npreferential right. A Writ Petition was filed by the 5\nrespondent challenging the said order, which was\ndismissed by a Single Judge. The same was challenged in\nappeal but the Writ Appeal met with the same fate. The\nmatter was taken up before the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nand by order dated 9.3.2016 in SLP_ (Civil)\nNo.13561/2016, the Apex Court had disposed of the\nmatter directing that the instant petition be heard and\ndisposed off as the contention raised by the rival parties\nwas inextricably linked on the stay granted by this Court\nin the instant crime. No objection was raised either by the\n\n2016/KER/33657\n\nCrl.M.C.3269/2013 4\npetitioner or the Public Prosecutor to the application and\nhence, the same was allowed and the additional 5°\nrespondent was impleaded.\n\n5.I have heard the submissions advanced.\n\n6.The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner\nwould contend that even if the entire allegations in\nAnnexure-I and Annexure-II are admitted as true and\ncorrect, the offence under section 55 (a) and (i) of Act I of\n1077 will not be attracted. Much reliance was placed on\nthe judgment of the learned Single Judge in WP(C) No.\n20871 of 2015 to nail home the said point. Referring to\nAnnexure-A judgment, it is submitted that the learned\nSingle Judge had held, after a meticulous analysis of law\non the point, that for any breach of license conditions,\nwhich may have been, incidentally an offence under the\nother provisions of the Act, the licensee could be made\nanswerable only under section 56 of the Act. It is further\ncontended that the aforesaid judgment of the learned\nSingle Judge was confirmed in appeal and though the\n\nBuspar\nsolanenes 657\n\nCrl.M.C.3269/2013 5\nsame was taken up before the Apex Court, the findings\nwere not interfered. There is no reason to take a different\nview is the submission.\n\n7.It is the contention of the learned Senior Counsel that\nwhat was found in the toddy shop was IMFL purchased\nfrom the Beverages Corporation and referring to Chapter\nVI of Abkari Shops Disposal Rules, 2002, which deals with\nthe general conditions applicable to licensees of Toddy or\nForeign Liquor 1 Shops, it is argued that in case of\nviolation of conditions of license, only the offence under\nsection 56(b) will be attracted. Much reliance was placed\nby the learned senior counsel on the orders of this Court\nin Mohanan V_ State of Kerala (2007 (1) KLT 845)\nRajan _and others V State of Kerala _ and another\n[2010 (3) KLJ 461] and Jith and Others v State of\nKerala [2013(3) KHC 138] to bring home this point.\nAccording to the learned counsel, even if it is admitted\nthat the accused Nos. 1 and 2 had kept IMFL in the toddy\nshop which is licensed and the said violation amounts to a\n\n2016/KER/33657\n\nCrl.M.C.3269/2013 6\nviolation of the Abkari Shops Disposal Rules, 2002, only\nthe offence under section 56 (b) of Act 1 of 1077 will be\nattracted.\n\n8.Referring to Annexure-I FIR and Annexure-II mahazar, it\nis contended by the learned Senior Counsel that it is\nindisputable that the liquor seized was IMFL and not illicit\nliquor. Annexure-II would also reveal that the unopened\nbottles were found sealed. The officers were also\nconvinced that what was seized was IMFL and if that be\nthe case, the initiation of prosecution under Section 55(a)\nor (i) cannot be justified. Elaborating further, it is\ncontended that mere possession of IMFL will not attract\nthe offence unless the prosecution has a case that the\nsame was illegally imported or exported or stored for the\nprohibited purposes. In other words, according to the\nlearned Senior counsel, for the simple violation of Rule 7\n(5) of the Kerala Abkari Shops Disposal Rules, 2002\n(‘Rules 2002' for brevity) the consequence that will visit\nthe petitioner would only be one under Section 56 (b) of\n\n2016/KER/33657\n\nCrl.M.C.3269/2013 7\nAct 1 of 1077.\n\n9.An alternate contention is raised by the learned senior\ncounsel that Annexures-III and IV certificates would\nreveal that the accused Nos. 1 and 2 are not employees of\nthe petitioner and even if they were found in possession of\nIMFL within the permissible limit, no mens rea can be\nattributed to the petitioner for invoking any grave offence\nexcept the offence under section 56 (b) of Act 1 of 1077.\nReference is also made to Annexure-G order dated\n30.6.2015 of the Excise Commissioner which according to\nthe learned counsel would show that the accused Nos. 1\nand 2 are not the employees of the petitioner. According\nto the learned counsel, the possibility of rivals securing\nthe services of the accused Nos. 1 and 2 to get the\npetitioner herein disqualified also could not be ruled out.\n\n10.According to the learned senior counsel, the presumption\nunder section 64 of the Act will be attracted only if it is\nproved that the offence was committed with the\nknowledge and consent of the licensee. It is argued that\n\n2016/KER/33657\n\nCrl.M.C.3269/2013 8\nthe existence of mens rea is a necessary ingredient to\navail the presumption under the statute. Reference is\nmade to the judgment of the Apex Court in Arjunan v\nState of Kerala [2007 (2) KLT 958].\n\n11.Per contra, the learned Public Prosecutor after refuting\nthe submissions of the learned Senior Counsel contended\nthat immediately after the registration of the crime on\n11.7.2013, the instant petition was filed on 2.7.2013. All\nfurther proceedings were stayed on 26.8.2013. The\nlinchpin of the contention raised by the learned counsel\nthat the offence under section 55 (a) and (i) will not be\nattracted is based on the assumption that what was seized\nwas licit. According to the learned Public Prosecutor,\nwithout sending the sample for analysis and without\nsecuring a report of analysis of the sample, it would be\npremature for this Court to come to a conclusion that the\noffence under Section 55 will not be attracted. The learned\nprosecutor also reminded this Court that it is by now\nsettled that this Court would venture to quash the FIR\n\n2016/KER/33657\n\nCrl.M.C.3269/2013 9\nonly in the rarest of rare cases. According to the learned\nPublic Prosecutor, the facts are hazy and disputed and this\nCourt would not be justified in interfering at this stage.\n\n12.The learned Counsel appearing for the additional 5\"\nrespondent would support the contentions of the learned\nPublic Prosecutor. Elaborating on the same, it is\ncontended that the statements in Annexures-I and II as\nregards the nature of the IMFL seized cannot be the basis\nfor concluding that Section 55(a) or (i) of Act 1 of 1077\nwill not be attracted. This is more so when no one has a\ncase that the liquor was sourced from an authorized\nvendor.\n\n13.It is further contended that under Section 64 of the Act\nthere is a statutory presumption regarding the commission\nof an offence and that the said presumption applies to any\noffence under Section 55 of the Act. In the case on hand\nthe proceedings have been initiated against the petitioner\nunder Section 55(a) and (i) of the Act 1 of 1077 and the\nquestion whether the accused had mens rea or otherwise\n\nPa\n2016/KER/33657\nCrl.M.C.3269/2013 10\ncannot be adjudicated at this stage. It is also pointed out\nthat violation of Section 15 of the Act will attract the\noffence under Section 63 of the Act and the prayer of the\npetitioner to quash Annexure-I FIR is untenable. It is\nfurther urged assiduously that Section 55 of the Act would\nbe attracted against a licensee as well, in certain fact\nscenarios, and the contention of the petitioner that only\nSection 56(b) of the Act will be attracted is untenable.\n14.After having heard the 7 diametrically opposite\ninterpretations on facts and law advanced by the learned\nCounsel, it is felt that it will only be appropriate to scan\nthrough the relevant statutory provisions. Section 55 of\nthe Act reads as follows :-\n\"55. For illegal import, etc.:- Whoever in\ncontravention of this Act or of any rule or order\nmade under this Act\n(a) imports, exports, transports, transits\nor possesses liquor or any intoxicating\ndrug; or -\n(b) XXXX; OF\n(c) XXXX; OF\n(d) XXXX; OF\n(e) XXXX; OF\n(f) XXXX; Or\n(g) XXXX} Or\n\neas\n2016/KER/33657\nCril.M.C.3269/2013 11\n(A) XXXX; OF\n(i) sells or stores for sale liquor or any\nintoxicating drug; shall be punishable\n(1) for any offence, other than an\noffence falling under clause (d) or clause\n(e), with imprisonment for a term which\nmay extend to ten years and with fine\nwhich shall not be less than rupees one\nlakh and\n(2) for an offence falling under clause\n(d) or clause (e), with imprisonment for\na term which may extend to one year, or\nwith fine which may extend to ten\nthousand rupees, or with — both.\nExplanation: - Xxxxx”\n15.Section 56 penalizes a licensee for any misconduct. In\nthe case on hand we are concerned with section 56 (b) of\nthe Act which reads as follows:-\n\"56. For misconduct by _ licensee,  etc.--\nWhoever, being the holder of a licence or\npermit granted under this Act [or being in the\nemployment of such holder and acting on his\nbehalf -]\n(a) XXxXx; or\n(b) willfully does or omits to do anything\nin breach of any of the conditions of his\nlicence or permit not otherwise provided\nfor in this Act; or.”\n16.It would also be apposite to refer to Rule 7(5) and Rule\n9(1) of the Abkari Shops Disposal Rules, 2002.\n\"Rule 7(5): The Possession or sale at a\n\neas\n2016/KER/33657\nCril.M.C.3269/2013 12\n\nlicensed premises of any liquor other than\n\nthat to which the _ flicense relates is\n\nprohibited.\n\nRule 9.(1): The right conferred by a\n\nlicensee under this Chapter extends only to\n\nthe manufacture and sale of fermented\n\ntoddy and not other kinds of liquors. No\n\ntoddy depot will be granted to any licensee.”\n\n17.The argument of the petitioner centers around the ratio\n\nof the Judgment of a Division Bench of this Court in\nSurendran v. Excise Inspector [2004 (1) KLT 404]\nwherein it was held that when a person is in possession of\nliquor while illegally importing or transporting imported\nliquor, it will be covered under S.55 (a) of the Act and\nmere possession of illicit liquor or liquor will only come\nunder section 58. In paragraph 10 of the Division Bench\njudgment, it was stated as follows:\n\n\"10. The matter can be looked at from\n\nanother angle also. Keeping in view the\n\nslight similarity in language it is permissible\n\nto refer to the heading of the provision. S.55\n\nis labelled as - \"for illegal imports etc.\" Thus,\n\nthe Legislature is providing for penalty in a\n\ncase where a_ person illegally imports\n\nalcohol. S.58 makes the \"possession of illicit\n\nliquor\" culpable. Resultantly, it is clear that\n\nwhen a person is in possession of liquor\n\nwhile illegally importing it the case would be\n\nBeer\n2016/KER/33657\nCrl.M.C.3269/2013 13\n\ncovered under S. 55(a). In a case where the\n\npossession is of illicit liquor the case would\n\nfall within S.58. In other words, we hold\n\nthat the view as expressed in Rajeevan v.\n\nExcise Inspector and Purushan v. State of\n\nKerala is correct.”\n\n18.In Mohanan v. State of Kerala [2007(1) KLT 845] the\n\nquestion was whether a toddy tapper who had tapped\ntoddy from a licensed coconut tree and was transporting\nthe same in a bicycle could be proceeded against under\nSection 55(a) of the Abkari Act. A Division Bench of this\nCourt after meticulous evaluation of the relevant\nprovisions had held that he could not be convicted under\nSection 55(a) and only an offence under Section 63 of the\nAct was made out. This Court after profusely referring to\nthe statutory provisions and also the judgment in\nSurendran (supra), held in paragraph 10 as follows:\n\n\"10. Now, the matter is settled by the\n\nDivision Bench decision of this Court in\n\nSurendran v. Excise Inspector, 2004 KHC 72\n\n: 2004 (1) KLT 404 wherein it was held that\n\nS.55(a) of the Act deals with only illegal\n\nimport, export or transport, transit etc. on\n\nsuch import or export. It was made clear\n\nthat S.55(a) is applicable only when persons\n\nillegally imports or transport liquor or in\n\npossession of liquor while illegally importing.\n\neas\npasha\n2016/KER/33657\nCrl.M.C.3269/2013 14\nThe observations made in Karthikeyan v.\nState of Kerala, 2000 KHC 692 : 2000 (2)\nKL 649 : 2000 (3) KLT 639, Balan v. State\nof Kerala, 2002 KHC 748 : 2002 (2) KLJ 196\n: ILR 2002 (3) Ker. 438 : 2002 (3) KLT 161\nand George Issac v. State of Kerala, 2004\nKHC 121 : ILR 2004 (2) Ker. 218 : 2004 (1)\nKLT 752 contrary to the decision made in\nSurendran's case (supra) are no more good\nlaw. It is true that if a licensee illegally\nmanufacture liquor or intoxicating drugs,\napart from S.56, he may be guilty under\nS.55(b). Further, if he makes of sells\ndenatured spirit fit for human consumption\nor adulterate liquor, he will be punishable\nunder the other sections also like S.57, 57A\netc. But, S.55(a) will not be attracted\nmerely because he sells the liquor on a\nprohibited day, but, punishment can be\nimposed under S.56. As far as S.55 is\nconcerned, sub clause (a) deals with illegal\nimports and exports of liquor or intoxicating\ndrugs or transports or possesses such liquor\ncovered under import or export. Sub clause\n(b) deals with manufacture of the same. Sub\nclauses (d) and (e) deal with illegal toddy\ntapping or drawing of toddy from trees. S.55\n(f) deals with engagement in construction or\nworks relating to illegal distillery, brewery\netc. and clause (g) deals with possession of\nutensils or implements or apparatus for\nmanufacturing illegal liquor. S.55(h) deals\nwith bottling of liquor for the purposes of\nsale without licence and clause (i) deals with\nillegally storing of liquor for selling the\nsame. Other abkari offences are specifically\ndealt with in various other provisions. ”\n19.In other words it was made clear in Mohanan (supra)\n\n2016/KER/33657\n\nCrl.M.C.3269/2013 15\nthat S.55(a) is applicable only when a person illegally\nimports or transport liquor or is in possession of liquor\nwhile illegally importing it. It was also held that if a\nlicensee illegally manufacture liquor or intoxicating drugs,\napart from S.56, he may be guilty under S.55(b). Further,\nif he makes of sells denatured spirit fit for Numan\nconsumption or adulterate liquor, he will be punishable\nunder the other Sections also like S.57, 57A etc. But,\nS.55(a) will not be attracted merely because he sells the\nliquor on aé prohibited day, but, punishment can be\nimposed under S.56.\n\n20.The learned Counsel had addressed much as to the\nintention of the legislature in carrying out the amendment\nto Section 55(a) of the Act. By Act 16 of 1997, the words,\n“or of any license or permit obtained under this Act” was\nomitted. Prior to the amendment, the principal part of\nSection 55 had treated a stranger and a licensee alike.\nTherefore, when a licensee commits violation of the Rules\nof 2002, he cannot be said to have infringed Section 55 of\n\nBusan\n2016/KER/33657\nCrl.M.C.3269/2013 16\nthe Abkari Act. Section 56 is confined to the licensees and\nthe permit holders and in the light of the amendment, the\nintention of the legislature was to bring out the licensees\nfrom the ambit of Section 55 if the violation was of the\nRules of 2002.\n21.In Rajan and Others v. State of Kerala [2010(3) KLJ\n\n461], a Single Judge of this Court had occasion to consider\nthe question as to whether the storing of toddy outside\nthe licensed premises would attract Section 55(a) and (i)\nof the Abkari Act. It was held that storing of toddy\noutside the licensed premises would violate only sub rule\n(5) of Rule 7 of Kerala Abkari Shops Disposal Rules which\nprovides that possession or sale of any liquor other than\nto which the license relates is prohibited. It was held that\nthe act of a licensee of a toddy shop who violates the\nRules will only attract Section 56(b) of the Abkari Act and\nnot Section 55(a) of the Act. It was held as follows:\n\nQuestion then is whether an offence under\n\nS.55(i) is attracted. S.55(i) before its\n\namendment by Act 16 of 1997, provides\n\nmeee\n2016/KER/33657\nCril.M.C.3269/2013 17\n\nthat whoever in contravention of this Act or\nof any Rule or order made under this Act or\nby any licensee or permit obtained under\nthis Act, import, export, transports or\npossesses liquor or any intoxicating drug, he\nis punishable with imprisonment for a term\nwhich may extend to two years and with fine\nwhich shall not be less than twenty five\nthousand rupees. By amendment Act of 16\nof 1997 invoking S.55 against the licensee\nfor contravention of the provisions of the\nlicence or permit obtained under the Act was\nexcluded by deleting the words ‘or of any\nlicence or permit obtained under this Act'. As\na result, if there is a violation of the\nconditions of the licence or permit, alone by\na licensee, an offence under S.55(a) or 55\n(i) will not be attracted. So also, ‘storing for\nsale of liquor’ though originally not included\nwithin the ambit of S.55(i), subsequent to\namendment Act 16 of 1997, whoever in\ncontravention of the Act or of any rule or\norder made under the Act sells or stores for\nsales liquor or any intoxicating drug is also\nliable for punishment under the said section.\nSo also sentence for the offences were\nenhanced to imprisonment for ten years and\nwith fine which shall not be less than rupees\none lakh. Therefore, w.e.f. 03/06/1997, if a\nlicensee has violated the terms of the licence\nor permit and stored liquor outside the\nlicensed premises, an offence under S.55(i)\nwill not be attracted against the licensee or\nhis employees, if they are acting under the\nlicensee.\n\n2016/KER/33657\n\nCrl.M.C.3269/2013 18\n\n22.In Jith and others v. State of Kerala [2013(3) KHC\n138], the question was whether transportation or storage\nof toddy in excess of prescribed quantity would attract\nSection 55(a) or (i) of the Abkari Act. It was held that the\naccused could not be prosecuted for violation of Section\n55(a) and (i) of the Abkari Act and the only offence\nattracted will be under Section 56(b) of the Abkari Act.\n\n23.In Ravi v. State of Kerala [2011(3) KLT 353], this\nCourt relying on Thomas V State of Kerala [2005 KHC\n1786] held that possession of IMFL, which is not a\nprohibited liquor, simplicitor, is not an offence under\nsection 55 (a) of the Act.\n\n24.The question as to whether this Court in exercise of its\njurisdiction Under Section 482 of the Code can quash the\nfirst information report itself is integrally and inexorably\nintertwined with the jurisdiction and power of the police\nofficer to investigate into commission of a cognizable case.\nCatena of decisions are referred by the learned Senior\nCounsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners, the\n\neas\n2016/KER/33657\nCrl.M.C.3269/2013 19\n\nlearned Public Prosecutor and the learned counsel\nappearing for the 5‘ respondent. The distinction in law\nbetween the powers of the Court to take cognizance of a\ncase and their powers of inquiry and trial on the one hand\nand the powers of a police officer to investigate into a\ncase relating to commission of a cognizable offence on the\nother hand are too well recognized. It has been observed\nby higher Courts that function of the judiciary and the\npolice are complementary and not overlapping. It has\nbeen clearly held that the Court's functions begin when a\ncharge is preferred before it and not until then. In\nEmperor v. Khwaja Nazir Ahmad [AIR (32) 1945 P.C.\n18] the Privy Council speaking through Lord Porter\nobserved as follows :\n\n\"In their _Lordships' opinion however, the\n\nmore serious aspect of the case is to be\n\nfound in the resultant interference by the\n\nCourt with the duties of the police. Just_as\n\nit is essential that every one accused of a\n\ncrime should have free access to a Court of\n\njustice so that he may be duly acquitted if\n\nfound not guilty of the offence with which\n\nhe _is_ charged, so _it_is of the utmost\n\nimportance that the judiciary should not\n\neas\n2016/KER/33657\nCril.M.C.3269/2013 20\ninterfere with the police _in_matters which\nare within their province and into which the\nlaw imposes upon them the duty of\nenquiry. In India as has been shown there\nis a statutory right on the part of the police\nto investigate the circumstances of an\nalleged cognizable crime without requiring\nany authority from the judicial authorities,\nand it would, as their Lordships think, be\nan unfortunate result if it should be held\npossible to interfere with those statutory\nrights by an exercise of the inherent\njurisdiction of the Court. The functions of\nthe judiciary and the police’ are\ncomplementary not overlapping and the\ncombination of individual liberty with a due\nobservance of law and order is only to be\nobtained by leaving each to exercise its\nown function, always, of course-subject to\nthe right of the Court to intervene in an\nappropriate case when moved Under\nSection 491. Criminal P.C. to give\ndirections in the nature of habeas corpus.\nIn such a case as the present-however, the\nCourt's functions begin when a charge is\npreferred before it and not until then\n(emphasis of mine). It has sometimes been\nthought that Section 561-A has given\nincreased powers to the Court which it did\nnot possess before that section was\nenacted. But this is not so. The section\ngives no new powers, it only provides that\nthose which the Court already inherently\npossess Shall be preserved and is inserted,\nas their Lordships think, lest it should be\nconsidered that the only powers possessed\nby the Court are those expressly conferred\nby the Criminal Procedure Code, and that\nno inherent power had survived the passing\nof that Act. No doubt, if no cognizable\n\nmeee\n2016/KER/33657\n\nCril.M.C.3269/2013 21\n\noffence is disclosed, and still more if no\noffence of any kind is disclosed, the police\nwould have no authority to undertake an\ninvestigation and for this reason Newsam,\nJ. may well have decided rightly in AIR\n1938 Mad. 129\". (emphasis supplied )\n\n25.A Full Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Som\nMittal Vs Government of Karnataka [2008 (3) SCC\n574], after surveying a series of judgments rendered by\nthe Apex Court delineated the scope of exercise of powers\nof this Court under Section 482 of the Code in the matter\nof quashing of an FIR and it was held as follows :-\n\n11. We now refer to a few decisions of this\nCourt deprecating the exercise of extra\nordinary or inherent powers by the High\nCourt according to its whims and caprice.\n\n12. In State of Bihar v. J.A.C. Saldanha\n1980 CriLJ 98 this Court pointed out at SCC\np. 574:\n\nThe High Court in exercise of the\nextraordinary jurisdiction committed a grave\nerror by making observations on seriously\ndisputed questions of facts taking its cue\nfrom affidavits which in such a_ situation\nwould hardly provide any reliable material.\nIn our opinion the High Court was clearly in\nerror in giving the direction virtually\namounting to a mandamus to close the case\nbefore the investigation is complete. We say\nno more.\n\n13. In Hazari Lal Gupta v. Rameshwar\n\neas\n2016/KER/33657\nCril.M.C.3269/2013 22\nPrasad 1972 CrilJ 298 this Court at SCC p.\n455 pointed out:\nIn exercising jurisdiction under Section 561-\nA of the Criminal Procedure Code, the High\nCourt can quash proceedings if there is no\nlegal evidence or if there is any impediment\nto the institution or continuance’ of\nproceedings but the High Court does not\nordinarily inquire as to whether the evidence\nis ‘reliable or not’. Where — again,\ninvestigation into the circumstances of an\nalleged cognizable, offence is carried on\nunder the provisions of the Criminal\nProcedure Code, the High Court does not\ninterfere with such investigation because it\nwould then be the impeding investigation\nand jurisdiction of statutory authorities to\nexercise power in accordance with the\nprovisions of the Criminal Procedure Code.\n14, In Jehan Singh sv. Delhi\nAdministration 1974 CrilJ 802 _ the\napplication filed by the accused under\nSection 561-A of the old Code for quashing\nthe investigation was dismissed as being\npremature and incompetent on the finding\nthat prima facie, the allegations in the FIR,\nif assumed to be correct, constitute a\ncognizable offence.\n15. In Kurukshetra University v. State of\nHaryana 1977 CrilJ 1900, this Court\npointed out:\nIt surprises us in the extreme that the High\nCourt thought that in the exercise of its\ninherent powers under Section 482 of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure, it could quash a\nfirst information report. The police had not\neven commenced investigation into the\n\neas\n2016/KER/33657\nCril.M.C.3269/2013 23\ncomplaint filed by the Warden of the\nUniversity and no proceeding at all was\npending in any court in pursuance of the\nFIR. It ought to be realized that inherent\npowers do not confer an_ arbitrary\njurisdiction on the High Court to act\naccording to whim or caprice. That statutory\npower has to be exercised sparingly, with\ncircumspection and in the rarest of rare\ncases. (emphasis supplied)\n16. In State of Bihar v. Murad Ali Khan\n1989 CriLJ 1005 this Court held that the\njurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code\nhas to be exercised sparingly and with\ncircumspection and has given the working\nthat in exercising that jurisdiction, the High\nCourt should not embark upon an enquiry\nwhether the allegations in the complaint are\nlikely to be established by evidence or not.\n17. In State of Haryana and Ors.\n(appellant) v. Bhajan Lal and Ors.\n(respondents) 1992 CrilJ527 , this Court\nafter referring to various decisions of this\nCourt, enumerated various categories of\ncases by way of illustration wherein the\ninherent power under Section 482 of the\nCode should be exercised by the High Court.\nThey are:\n(1) Where the allegations made in the first\ninformation report or the complaint, even if\nthey are taken at their face value and\naccepted in their entirety do not prima facie\nconstitute any offence or make out a case\nagainst the accused.\n(2) Where the allegations in the first\ninformation report and other materials, if\n\neas\n2016/KER/33657\nCrl.M.C.3269/2013 24\nany, accompanying the FIR do not disclose a\ncognizable offence, justifying an\ninvestigation by police officers under Section\n156(1) of the Code except under an order of\na Magistrate within the purview of Section\n155(2) of the Code.\n(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations\nmade in the FIR or complaint and the\nevidence collected in support of the same do\nnot disclose the commission of any offence\nand make out a case against the accused.\n(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not\nconstitute a cognizable offence but\nconstitute only a non-cognizable offence, no\ninvestigation is permitted by a police officer\nwithout an order of a Magistrate as\ncontemplated under Section 155(2) of the\nCode.\n(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR\nor complaint are so absurd and inherently\nimprobable on the basis of which no prudent\nperson can ever reach a just conclusion that\nthere is sufficient ground for proceeding\nagainst the accused.\n(6) Where there is an express legal bar\nengrafted in any of the provisions of the\nCode or the concerned Act (under which a\ncriminal proceeding is instituted) to the\ninstitution and continuance of the\nproceedings and/or where there is a specific\nprovision in the Code or the concerned Act,\nproviding efficacious redress for _ the\ngrievance of the aggrieved party.\n(7) Where a_ criminal proceeding is\nmanifestly attended with mala fide and/or\n\neas\n2016/KER/33657\n\nCri.M.C.3269/2013 25\n\nwhere the proceeding is maliciously\ninstituted with an _ ulterior motive for\nwreaking vengeance on the accused and\nwith a view to spite him due to private and\npersonal grudge.\n\n18. We may observe here that despite this\nCourt's consistently held in catena of\ndecisions that_inherent power of the High\nCourt should not be exercised according to\nwhims and caprice and it has to be\nexercised sparingly, with circumspection and\nin the rarest of rare cases, we often come\nacross the High Court exercising the\ninherent power under Section 482 of the\nCode _ of Criminal Procedure _in_a_ routine\nmanner _at_ its whims and caprice setting at\nnaught the cognizance taken and the FIR\nlodged _at_ the threshold committing grave\nmiscarriage of justice. While it is true that\nso long as the inherent power of Section\n482 is in the Statute Book, exercise of such\npower is not impermissible but it must be\nnoted that such power has to be exercised\nsparingly with circumspection and in the\nrarest of rare cases, the sole aim of which is\nto’ secure the ends of justice. The power\nunder Section 482 is not intended to scuttle\njustice at the threshold.\n\n(emphasis supplied )\n\n26.I have bestowed my anxious considerations to the facts\nof the instant case and also the precedents cited at the\nbar. Admittedly, the petitioner herein, who has been\narrayed as the 3™ accused in Annexure-I FIR is the\nlicensee of toddy shop No.76 of Thonnuchira in group\n\neas\nsolanenes 657\n\nCrl.M.C.3269/2013 26\nNo.21 of Kuttanadu range. Specific allegations in\nAnnexures-I and II is that the accused Nos. 1 and 2 who\nare the Manager and salesman were found selling IMFL in\nthe Managers Room of the toddy shop. The petitioner\ndisputes the fact that accused Nos. 1 and 2 are his\nemployees. He relies on Annexures-III and IV to contend\nthat they are employees of another toddy shop. Question\nwhether they are employees of the another toddy shop or\notherwise is a matter of evidence and in this petition, this\nCourt will not be in a position to judge on the veracity of\nthe said claim. However, it is borne out from Annexures-\nI and II , that the contents of the open bottle found in the\npremises was tested using olfactory and gustatory senses\nby the detecting officer and the attesters and they prima\nfacie came to the conclusion that the seized items was in\nfact IMFL.\n\n27.the olfactory and gustatory senses of experienced\nofficers to identify liquor through smell and taste will not\nordinarily be enough for a court of law to conclude that\n\neas\nsolanenes 657\n\nCrl.M.C.3269/2013 27\nthe seized liquid is licit liquor, or for that matter, to hold\nthat IMFL was procured from a legal vendor. The report of\na public Analyst would be the minimum requirement to\narrive at such a conclusion. However, for the purpose of\nregistering a crime, there is no embargo in the officer\nrelying on his senses. Admittedly, no chemical analysis\nwas obtained as investigation was stayed .\n\n28.1 am of the firm view that, that in a proceeding under\nSection 482 of the Code, when this Court is called upon to\nquash the Criminal Proceedings at the threshold stage, the\nfact that the prosecution was prevented from securing a\nproper report of analysis to ascertain the exact nature of\nthe seized liquor would dissuade this Court from holding\nthat the only offence attracted is under Section 56(b) of\nAct 1 of 1077. If the analysis report was before this Court\nand it was reported that the item seized was indeed IMFL,\nthe result would have been different. The possibility of the\nInvestigating agency concluding that certain offences\nincorporated in the FIR was not made out in the Final\n\nBusan\n2016/KER/33657\n\nCrl.M.C.3269/2013 28\nreport also could not be ruled out. All these factors hinge\non the investigation to be carried out by the police\nconsequent to the registration of the crime. In view of\nthe above, I am unable to conclude at this stage that the\nproceedings are frivolous or vexatious and the same is\nliable to be quashed .\n\n29.The precedents cited by the learned senior counsel will\ncome to the rescue of the petitioner only if on analysis , it\nis revealed that the liquor seized was licit and procured\nlegally. At this stage, this Court is not able to accept the\ncontention of the learned senior counsel that the liquor\nfound in the premises was lawfully procured from an\nauthorized vendor. When the petitioner has distanced\nhimself from accused Nos. 1 and 2, it is inconceivable as\nto how he can assert that the IMFL found in the room of\nthe Manager was licit and the same was procured from the\nState owned Corporation, the authorized dispenser of\nIMFL, in the State of Kerala. The question whether\naccused Nos. 1 and 2 are the employees of the petitioners\n\n2016/KER/33657\n\nCrl.M.C.3269/2013 29\nor are strangers are all matters which cannot be decided\nby this Court at this stage.\n\n30.I am not oblivious of the judgment rendered by a Single\nJudge of this Court where it was held that for any breach\nof the license conditions, which may have been,\nincidentally, an offence under the other provisions of the\nAct, the licensee could be made answerable only under\nSection 56 of the Act and not under the other Penal\nprovisions. There cannot be any dispute with regard to the\nsaid fact and the said position has been laid down by this\nCourt in a catena of judgments, some of which have been\nreferred above .\n\n31.However, in the instant petition, where the question is\nwhether the proceedings can be quashed at the threshold\nstage itself on the ground that the alleged offences are not\nmade out, different considerations would prevail.\n\n32.As has been consistently held by the Apex Court, the\nscope of exercise of powers at the stage of registration of\nthe FIR is limited. Powers under section 482 are to be\n\nPa\npecs\n2016/KER/33657\nCrl.M.C.3269/2013 30\nexercised sparingly and with circumspection and this Court\nwill not be justified in embarking upon a roving enquiry to\nfind out whether the allegations in the FIR are likely to be\nestablished in the course of Investigation. At this stage, it\nwill not be possible or appropriate for this Court to\nexpress any opinion on merits and I find it difficult to hold\nthat the petitioner has made out a case for interference\nwith the registration of the FIR at this stage.\nConsequently, the petition will stand dismissed.\nSd/-\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN.\nPs JUDGE\n\n"
