The offences involved are under Sections 182\nand 193 of the Indian Penal Code. The petitioner seeks orders\nquashing the prosecution in view of the bar of cognizance under\nSection 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The police\nregistered FIR in the case under Section 154 of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure, proceeded for investigation, and submitted\nfinal report under Section 173(2) of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure. It appears that nobody advised the police regarding\ncognizance and the bar of cognizance under Section 195 of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure. In view of the clear bar of\ncognizance under Section 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure\nthat no court shall take cognizance of such offence except on a\ncomplaint in writing made by the proper person, this prosecution\ncannot proceed. Accordingly, it is liable to be quashed under\n\nDigger\napes\n2015/KER/212\nCrl.M.C No.12 of 2015 2\nSection 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as an\nunsustainable one and a clear abuse of legal process.\nIn the result, this Criminal Miscellaneous Case is\nallowed. The prosecution against the petitioner herein in S.T\nNo.8977/2010 before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court I,\nNorth Paravur, will stand quashed under Section 482 of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure. Accordingly, the petitioner will\nstand released from prosecution, and the bail bond, if any,\nexecuted by him will stand discharged.\nP.UBAID\nJUDGE\nab\n\n"
