The aforesaid case was registered against the\npetitioner on the basis of the first information statement given to\nthe police by the second respondent (hereinafter referred to as\n‘the complainant’).\n\n3. The material averments in the ffirst information\nstatement given to the police by the complainant are as follows:\nThe complainant had purchased a villa constructed by the\naccused in the year 2010 as per an agreement. The accused has\nnot provided recreation space in the compound of the villa as per\nRule 31(iii) of the Kerala Panchayat Building Rules, 2011. Inspite\n\nPeet\n(Blea\n2020/KER/687\n\nCr1.M.C.No.930/2018 ;\nof repeated demands made by the complainant and the other\npersons who owned villas in the residential complex, no such\nfacility has been provided by the accused. The accused has\ncheated the complainant and the other persons who reside in the\nvillas.\n\n4. This petition is filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C for\nquashing Annexure-A6 first information report (FIR) registered\nagainst the petitioner on the basis of the first information\nstatement given to the police by the complainant.\n\n5. Notice was served on the second respondent but he\nhas not chosen to appear and contest the case. Heard learned\ncounsel for the petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.\n\n6. Learned counsel for the petitioner has contended that\nthe complainant had entered into an agreement with the\npetitioner in the year 2010, entrusting the construction of the\nvilla to him. The Kerala Panchayat Building Rules, 2011\n(hereinafter referred to as ‘the Rules') was not in force at that\ntime. Therefore, the allegation that the petitioner has not\ncomplied with the requirements under Rule 31(iii) of the Rules,\n\nPeet\n(Blea\n2020/KER/687\n\nCr1.M.C.No.930/2018 ;\nhas no legs to stand on. Learned counsel for the petitioner also\ncontended that, even if it is accepted that there was any\nagreement between the petitioner and the complainant with\nregard to providing of recreational space, non-compliance with\nsuch a stipulation in the agreement, amounts to only a breach of\ncontract and the offence punishable under Section 420 I.P.C will\nnot be attracted. Learned counsel for the petitioner further\ncontended that the averments in the first information statement\ngiven to the police by the complainant do not attract the\ningredients of the offence of cheating as defined under Section\n415 I.P.C.\n\n7. Learned Public Prosecutor has not pointed out, how\nthe Rules which came into force only in the year 2011, would be\napplicable to the construction of the villa which was made as per\nan agreement executed in the year 2010.\n\n8. The Rules came into force only on 14.02.2011. Rule\n31(iii) of the Rules reads as follows:\n\n“All new developments including land\nsubdivisions, plot developments and pooling of land\n\n|\nood\nBSS\n2020/KER/687\nCr1.M.C.No.930/2018\nbs)\n\nowned by different owners shall be subject to the\n\nfollowing, namely,\n\n(iii) When the area of the land under\ndevelopment work, layout or subdivision (exceeding\n\nten plots) is 50 ares or more, 10% of the total area\n\nshall be provided for recreational open spaces and\n\nshall be suitably located to be accessible to the\n\nresidents of the locality: The open space shall be\n\nprovided exclusive of streets, culde-sacs, water body\n\nor swimming pools:”\n\n9. It is evident that Rule 31 applies only to new\ndevelopment of lands and plots and it does not apply to any\ndevelopment of land which had already commenced before it\ncame into force.\n\n10. Before the Rules came into force, the Kerala\nMunicipality Building Rules, 1999 were applicable to Panchayats.\nIn the instant case, the villa purchased by the complainant is\nsituated in a Panchayat. Rule 50(1) of the Kerala Municipality\nBuilding Rules, 1999 provides that any residential apartment\nhaving more than 12 dwelling units in a single plot or single\nbuilding shall be provided with a recreational space of suitable\n\nPeet\n(Blea\n2020/KER/687\n\nCr1.M.C.No.930/2018 ;\nsize. Rule 50(2) of the aforesaid Rules provides that the\nrecreational space as per sub-rule (1) shall have not less than\n6% of the total floor area of the units taken together and a\nminimum 35% of such recreational space shall be provided\noutside the building on the ground itself. However, Rule 50(1)\nand Rule 50(2) of the Kerala Municipality Building Rules, 1999\nare applicable only to an apartment as defined under Rule 2(g) of\nthe aforesaid Rules and the aforesaid provisions are not\napplicable to any villa which is an independent building. Rule\n2(g) of the Kerala Municipality Building Rules states that the word\n‘apartment’ is synonymous with residential flat.\n\n11. Even if it is accepted that the petitioner had agreed to\nprovide recreational space or other facilities in the compound of\nthe villa of the complainant, non-compliance with such stipulation\nin the agreement, if any executed between the petitioner and the\ncomplainant, will amount to only a breach of contract unless it is\nshown that even at the time of entering into the agreement, the\npetitioner had dishonest intention of not providing such facilities.\nMere breach of a stipulation in the agreement will not amount to\n\nPeet\n(Blea\n2020/KER/687\nCr1.M.C.No.930/2018 ,\nan offence of cheating which is defined under Section 415 I.P.C\nand the offence punishable under Section 420 I.P.C.\n\n12. There is distinction between mere breach of contract\nand the offence of cheating. Mere breach of contract cannot give\nrise to criminal prosecution for cheating unless fraudulent or\ndishonest intention is shown right at the beginning of the\ntransaction. To hold a person guilty of cheating it is necessary to\nshow that he had fraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of\nmaking the promise. From his mere failure to keep up the\npromise subsequently such a culpable intention right at the\nbeginning, that is, when he made the promise, cannot be\npresumed.\n\n13. In the instant case, there is no allegation in the first\ninformation statement given to the police by the complainant\nthat the petitioner had dishonest intention of not providing\nrecreational space when he entered into the agreement for\nconstruction of the villa with the complainant.\n\n14. Section 405 I.P.C shows that the ingredients of the\noffence of criminal breach of trust are the following: i) a person\n\nPeet\n(Blea\n2020/KER/687\nCr1.M.C.No.930/2018 ;\nshould have been entrusted with property, or entrusted with\ndominion over property; ii) that person should dishonestly\nmisappropriate or convert to his own use that property, or\ndishonestly use or dispose of that property or wilfully suffer any\nother person to do so; and iii) that such misappropriation,\nconversion, use or disposal should be in violation of any direction\nof law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be\ndischarged, or of any legal contract which the person has made,\ntouching the discharge of such trust.\n\n15. In the instant case, the complainant has no grievance\nthat the money, if any, entrusted by him with the petitioner was\nused by the petitioner in any manner in violation of the\nstipulations contained in the agreement executed between him\nand the petitioner. Therefore, the offence punishable under\nSection 406 I.P.C is also not attracted.\n\n16. In the aforesaid circumstances, continuation of the\ncriminal proceedings against the petitioner would be an abuse of\nprocess of law. The proceedings initiated against him pursuant\nto Annexure-A6 FIR are liable to be quashed.\n\na\n(Blea\n2020/KER/687\nCr1.M.C.No.930/2018\n9\n17. Consequently, the petition is allowed. The entire\nproceedings against the petitioner based on Annexure-A6 FIR in\nCrime No.1000/2016 of Chottanikkara police station, are hereby\nquashed.\n(sd/-)\nR.NARAYANA PISHARADI, JUDGE\njsr/04/01/2020\n\nRee\nwae ic\nrca a fet\n2020/KER/687\nCr1.M.C.No.930/2018\n10\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE Al THE COPY OF THE AGREEMENT FOR\nCONSTRUCTION THAT WAS EXECUTED BETWEEN\nTHE COMPANY OF THE PETITIONER WITH THE\n2ND RESPONDENT\nANNEXURE A2 THE COPY OF THE BUILDING PERMIT DATED\n25.06.2010 ISSUED BY THE THIRUVANIYOOR\nGRAMA PANCHAYAT\nANNEXURE A3 THE COPY OF THE RECEIPT ISSUED BY THE\n2ND RESPONDENT ACKNOWLEDGING THE\nCOMPLETED VILLA.\nANNEXURE A4 SER THE PHOTOGRAPHS SHOWING THE VILLA\nCOMPLEX ALONG WITH COMMON AREA\nFACILITIES.\nANNEXURE A5 THE COPY OF THE SALE SALE DEED\nNO.2351/2010 OF THE 2ND RESPONDENT AND\nHIS WIFE WHEREIN THE RESIDENTIAL\nBUILDING IS CONSTRUCTED BY THE\nPETITIONER.\nANNEXUR A6 THE CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FIR AND FIS\nIN CRIME NO.1000/2016 OF CHOTTANIKKARA\nPOLICE STATION.\nRESPONDENTS!
