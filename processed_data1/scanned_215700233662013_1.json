TO JUDGE\n\nmbr/\n\nBupa\n2016/KER/33743\nSHAJI P. CHALY, J.\nDated this the 1* day of August, 2016\nJUDGMENT\n\nPetitioner herein has availed an agricultural loan from\nthe 4\" respondent bank. Petitioner could not repay the loan\ndue to failure of crops. Thereupon, petitioner approached the\nFarmers' Debt Relief Commission and secured Ext.P1 order.\nIn terms of Ext.P1, evident from Ext.P2 demand draft,\npetitioner has remitted Rs.50,000/- to the 4\" respondent bank.\nThe grievance voiced by the petitioner in this writ petition is\nthat, the respondent bank is not returning the original title\ndeed of the petitioner stating that, petitioner has not cleared\nthe dues towards the bank. According to the petitioner, the\nabove stand adopted by respondents 4 and 5 is against the\nfinal order passed by the Kerala State Farmers' Debt Relief\nCommission. It is in this backdrop, this writ petition is filed.\n\n2. Fourth respondent has filed a counter affidavit\nrefuting the allegations and claims and demands made by the\n\nBIR h\n2016/KER/33743\n\nW.P.(C). No.23366 of 2013 2\n\npetitioner. It is contended that, the loan account can be\nclosed on making payment of Rs.67,510/- viz., Rs.38,320/-\ntowards the principal amount and Rs.28,190/- towards\ninterest, apart from the interest accrued till date. It is also\ncontended that, the bank has never taken a stand that, it is\nnot bound by Ext.P1 award. There is no reason for the bank\n\nto challenge Ext.P1 as well. The relief claimed cannot be\ngranted. The 4 respondent has already clarified the position\n\nby its letter dated 31.1.2014 addressed to the 3™ respondent\nbefore the petitioner has filed the complaint. The true copy of\nthe said letter is produced as Ext.R4(a). Therefore, it is\ncontended by the 4\" respondent that, petitioner is not entitled\n\nto get any relief in this writ petition.\n\n3. Heard learned counsel for the petitioner, learned\nGovernment Pleader, learned counsel appearing for respondents\n4 and 5 and perused the pleadings and documents on record.\n\n4. The prime contention advanced by the learned counsel\nfor the petitioner is based on Section 5(4) of the Kerala\nFarmers Debt Relief Commission Act which reads thus:\n\nEaves\n2016/KER/33743\nW.P.(C). No.23366 of 2013 3\n“That an award passed by the Commission\nunder clause (d) of sub-section (1) shall be\nfinal and shall not be called in question in any\ncourt.”\n\nSection 5(d) enables the Commission to adjudicate\ndisputes between the farmers described in clause (b) and\ncreditors, other than institutional creditors, and to pass\nawards which shall be binding on both parties. Learned\ncounsel has also invited my attention to sub-section(3) of\nSection 5 which is a non-obstante clause which says that\nnotwithstanding anything contained in any other provisions of\nthis Act, any debt relief granted to a farmer by way of waiver\nof principal, interest and penal interest, if any shall not\nexceed seventy five per cent, if such debt is fifty thousand\nrupees or less, and fifty percent, if such debt exceeds fifty\nthousand rupees, arrived at after settlement or rupees one\nlakh whichever is less. Therefore, According to the learned\ncounsel for the petitioner, Ext.P1 order passed by the\nFarmers Debt relief Commission has become final. Neither\nthe petitioner nor the 4\" respondent did not challenge the\n\nBIR h\n2016/KER/33743\n\nW.P.(C). No.23366 of 2013 4\n\nsaid order. It is seen from Ext.P2 that, petitioner has complied\nwith the direction contained in Ext.P1 order by making a\npayment of Rs.50,000/-. Therefore, according to the\npetitioner, on payment of the said amount, the 4 respondent\nought to have returned the title deed of the property\nmortgaged by the petitioner since the entire debt due as per\nExt.P1 order has been remitted by the petitioner. It is also\nfound that, since the 4\" respondent did not return the title\ndeed, petitioner has approached the Munsiff Court,\nEttumanoor. However, the Munsiff Court has dismissed the\nsuit filed by the petitioner as per Ext.P5 judgment holding\nthat, the Munsiff Court does not have the power to entertain\nthe suit of said nature since there is a prohibition created\nunder Section 69 of the Kerala Co-operative Societies Act.\n\n5. On the other hand, learned counsel for the 4”\nrespondent submitted that as per Ext.P1 order, the Debt\nRelief Commission has considered the dues as on the said\ndate. Subsequently interest has fallen due to the already\nremaining principal amount and therefore, the petitioner is\n\nBIR h\n2016/KER/33743\nW.P.(C). No.23366 of 2013 5\nbound to pay altogether an amount of Rs.67,510/- and on\npayment of which alone, the 4\" respondent is liable to return\nthe title deed of the property of the petitioner.\n\n6. Taking into account the respective submissions and\ntotality of the circumstances involved in the writ petition, Iam\nof the considered opinion that, Ext.P1 has become final and as\nprovided under Section 5(4) of the Farmers' Debt Relief\nCommission Act, the order passed by the Commission is final\nand binding on the respective parties. If at all the\nrespondents had any case that, Ext.P1 order is only with\nrespect to the loan outstanding as on the said date of the\norder, definitely there would have been a finding accordingly\nin Ext.P1 order. The 4\" respondent has also not sought any\nclarification in tune with Ext.R4(a) filed along with the\ncounter affidavit to the effect that, till such time the amounts\nclaimed in Ext.R4(a) is due, 4\" respondent is not bound to\nreturn the title deed to the petitioner in terms of rule 17 of\nthe Rules provided under the Act. ‘Therefore, in my\nconsidered opinion, at this belated point of time, 4\"\n\nDee\npee\n2016/KER/33743\n\nW.P.(C). No.23366 of 2013 6\nrespondent cannot attack Ext.P1 order passed by the\nFarmers' Debt Relief Commission in any manner.\n\n7. Upshot of the above discussion is that, petitioner is\nentitled to succeed in the writ petition and accordingly there\nwill be a direction to the 4\" and 5\" respondents to return the\ntitle deeds of the property of the petitioner bearing\nNo.3037/1968 and 3004/1974 within three weeks from the\ndate of receipt of a copy of this judgment.\n\nWrit petition is allowed accordingly.\n\nSd/-\nSHAJI P. CHALY\nJUDGE\n\nsmv\n01.08.2016\n\n"
