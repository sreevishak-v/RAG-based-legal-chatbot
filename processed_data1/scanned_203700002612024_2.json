Smt.Anjana Kannath, learned Counsel for the petitioner\ncontended that due to the failure of the petitioner to appear before the\nlearned Magistrate, a non-bailable warrant has been issued apart from a\nlookout circular. It is further submitted that, without even serving\nsummons on the petitioner, a non bailable warrant could not have been\nissued. It was contended that, initially petitioners was not known to have\nbeen arrayed as an accused. Thereafter the investigation was\ntransferred to the Crime Branch and it was only then that petitioner was\nincluded in the list of accused, by which time, petitioner had gone\nabroad. It was contended by the learned Counsel that the entire\nprocedure of treating the petitioner as absconding and issuing a non-\nbailable warrant are all procedurally flawed and contrary to law. It was\nhowever submitted that petitioner is willing to appear before the Court\n\nBes ial\n2024/KER/4531\nCRL.MC NO. 261 OF 2024\n3\nand seek recall of warrant and apply for bail, but since he apprehends\nremand by the learned Magistrate, petitioner seeks for a direction to to\nhave his application considered on the same date itself.\n\n3. The learned Public Prosecutor submitted that petitioner has\nbeen absconding for a long time and it was only after a look out circular\nwas issued that he has finally to come down and seek bail.\n\n4. Taking note of the submissions made by the learned Counsel\nfor the petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor, | am of the view that\nsince the petitioner has expressed his willingness to come down and\nappear before the Court, it is only appropriate that the Crl.M.C.is\ndisposed of with a direction.\n\n5. Accordingly, if petitioner appears before the learned\nMagistrate on or before 31.01.2024, and apply for recall of warrant and\nfor bail, the learned Magistrate shall consider and pass appropriate\norders on the same day itself. Since the petitioner has expressed his\nwillingness to come down and appear before the Court, the lookout\ncircular issued against him shall be kept in abeyance till 31.01.204 to\nenable him to appear before the Court.\n\nThe Cri.M.C. is disposed of as above.\n\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\njm/\n\na\ntet ey UJ\npeace\n2024/KER/4531\nCRL.MC NO. 261 OF 2024\n4\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 261/2024\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES\nAnnexure At THE COPY OF THE FIR IN CRIME NO. 197/2021 OF\nSAKTHIKULANGARA POLICE STATION DATED\n29.3.2021\nAnnexure A2 THE RELEVANT PAGE OF THE PASSPORT, WHICH\nSHOWS THE DEPARTURE ON 26.6.2021\nAnnexure A3 THE RELEVANT PAGE OF THE PASSPORT, WHICH\nSHOWS THE ARRIVAL OF THE PETITIONER FROM\nCOCHIN TO QATAR ON 27.6.2021\n\n"
