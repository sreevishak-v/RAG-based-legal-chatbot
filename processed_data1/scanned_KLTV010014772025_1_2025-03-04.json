No.622/2025\n(Crime No.132/2025 of Chirayinkeezhu Police Station)\nPetitioners/Accused Nos. 1 and 3:-\n1. Askhay A.S, aged 28 years,\nS/o Ajaykumar, Sahridaya Sadanam,\nKodumam, Attingal P.O,\nThiruvananthapuram\n2. Muraleedharan Nair,\nS/o Vasudevan Pillai, Radhalayam,\nValiyayila Thottuvaram,\nChirayinkeezhu P.O, Thiruvananthapuram\nBy Advocate:-P.G. Saiju\nCounter Petitioners:-\n1. The Station House Officer, Chirayinkeezhu Police Station\n2. State of Kerala\nBy Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumary\nThis petition came up for hearing on 03/03/2025 and the court on 04/03/2025\npassed the following :\nORDER\nThis is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik\nSuraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail.\nCriminal M.C.No.622/2025 1/7\n\n2. The petitioners are alleged to have committed the offences punishable\nunder Sections 115(2), 118(1), 74, 76 and 324(2), r/w Section 3(5) of the\nBharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, and Crime No. 132/2025 of Chirayinkeezhu Police\nStation is registered against the petitioners arraying them as accused Nos. 1 and 3.\n\n3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- On 31.01.2025 at\nabout 12 Noon, the 3™ accused, who is the neighbour of the defacto complainant,\nobstructed the way leading to the house of the defacto complainant, by fixing\nbarbed wire fence. When the relative of the defacto complainant Sri.Ramachandran\nNair questioned the same, the 4\" accused threw a stone towards him, accused\nNos.4 and 5 fisted on his back, the 1% accused kicked him down, the 2\" accused\nbeat him with an iron bucket, and accused Nos.1, 3, 4 and 5 beat him, and when\nthe defacto complainant attempted to prevent the same, the 2™ accused caught hold\nof her hair, and the 1* accused, by using an iron bucket, beat her. At that time, the\ngranddaughter of the defacto complainant came there and helped the defacto\ncomplainant to get up, the 2\"! accused caught hold of her hair, and the 1 accused\nbeat and fisted her and tore her dress. In the incident, the relative of the defacto\ncomplainant Sri.Ramachandran Nair lost his mobile phone, causing a loss of\nRs.1,700/-.\n\nCriminal M.C.No.622/2025 2/7\n\n4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The\nInvestigating Officer filed report opposing the anticipatory bail application.\n\n5. Heard. Perused the records.\n\n6. The only point to be considered is, whether an order of anticipatory\nbail can be granted to the petitioners/accused Nos. 1 and 3.\n\n7. The Point: The 2™ petitioner/ 3 accused is the uncle of 1*\npetitioner / 1* accused. The defacto complainant is the neighbour of the\npetitioners. The petitioners along with the other accused are alleged to have\nassaulted the defacto complainant, her grand daughter and her relative. The\nmotive alleged is the animosity due to a dispute between the defacto complainant\nand the petitioners in connection with the pathway, leading to the house of the\ndefacto complainant.\n\n8. The petitioners submitted that, the defacto complainant is residing on\nthe immediate southern side of the property owned by the 2™ petitioner, and for\nthe ingress and egress of the defacto complainant and her family members, a\npathway having an extent of 3 links is located on the south-eastern side of the said\nproperty. It is submitted that, on several times, the defacto complainant and her\nmen tried to extend the width of the pathway, and the defacto complainant also\nobstructed the construction of boundary wall, separating the pathway and the\n\nCriminal M.C.No.622/2025 3/7\n\nproperty of the 2™ petitioner. The petitioners also submitted that, on 30.12.2024,\nwhile the family members were engaged in fencing the boundary of the said\nproperty, the defacto complainant along with one Ramachandran Nair reached\nthere and threw away the boundary stone and the iron fencing, and attacked the\npetitioners and they sustained injuries in the incident and took treatment from\nvarious hospitals, and thereafter, a false case has been foisted against the\npetitioners. According to the petitioners, they are innocent of the allegations\nlevelled against them and they have not committed any offence as alleged.\n\n9. There is serious allegation as against the petitioners. However, it is\nsignificant to note that the alleged incident occurred in view of a civil dispute. It\nis seen from the First Information Statement given by the defacto complainant\nthat, on the alleged date of incident, the 3 accused had attempted to construct a\nfence obstructing the pathway towards the house of the defacto complainant and\nas per the request of the defacto complainant, the brother of the daughter-in-law of\nthe defacto complainant by name Ramachandran came for her help, and thereafter,\nthe alleged incident occurred. The petitioners’ counsel submitted that, in fact, the\ndefacto complainant and the other person rushed into the spot, while the 2\"\npetitioner/ 3 accused and his family members were engaged in fencing their\nboundary and the petitioners were manhandled by them. According to the\n\nCriminal M.C.No.622/2025 Al7\n\npetitioners, the defacto complainant and the said Ramachandran had attacked the\npetitioners, causing severe injuries to the 1* petitioner and injuries to the 2™\npetitioner. Along with the bail application, the petitioners had produced their\ntreatment records from Taluk Head Quarters Hospital, Chirayinkeezhu. It is also\nsubmitted by the petitioners’ counsel that, though a complaint was given by the\npetitioners, it was not registered. The petitioners’ counsel further submitted that,\nthe defacto complainant had obstructed the construction of boundary wall\nseparating the pathway and their property, and that the 2\" petitioner had filed a\ncaveat petition before the Munsiff Court, Attingal as Caveat No. 3/2025.\nApparently, civil disputes are pending between the two. In view of the persisting\ncivil dispute and boundary dispute, it appears that, an exaggeration of the case or\nfabrication of the case cannot be ruled out. The learned Public Prosecutor\nsubmitted that, it is these petitioners, who caused injuries to the victim\nRamachandran Nair. However, it is relevant to note that there was an altercation\nbetween the two teams in view of the boundary dispute, and there is likelihood of\ncausing injuries in the said altercation. The involvement of the petitioners in the\nalleged offence is a matter of evidence. It would be a travesty of justice, if the\npetitioners are put behind the bars, if actually no offence is committed by them.\nThere is every possibility that the case is filed against them only to humiliate or\nCriminal M.C.No.622/2025 5/7\n\nharass the petitioners in view of the boundary dispute. So it appears that this is a\nfit case where an order of pre-arrest bail can be granted to the petitioners.\nIn the result, the petition is allowed on the following conditions:-\n\n(1) In the event of arrest, the petitioners/accused Nos. 1 and 3 shall\nbe released on bail on their executing bond for Rs.50,000/-\n(Rupees Fifty Thousand only) each with two solvent sureties\nfor the like sum each to the satisfaction of the arresting\nofficer/Investigating Officer, as the case may be.\n\n(2) Petitioners shall appear before the Investigating Officer\nbetween 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. on every Thursday for a period\nof 3 (three) months or till the filing of the final report,\nwhichever is earlier.\n\n(3) Petitioners shall also appear before the Investigating Officer as\nand when required.\n\n(4) Petitioners shall not commit any offence while on bail.\n\n(5) Petitioners shall not attempt to contact the defacto complainant\nor any of the prosecution witnesses, directly or through any\nother person, or in any other way try to tamper with the\nevidence or influence any witnesses or other persons related\nto the investigation.\n\nCriminal M.C.No.622/2025 6/7\n\nIn case of any violation of the above conditions or misuse of liberty,\nthe prosecution or the defacto complainant is at liberty to approach jurisdictional\ncourt for cancellation of bail.\n\n(Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and\npronounced by me in Open Court on this the 4\" day of March 2025)\nSd/-\nNAZEERA.S\nSESSIONS JUDGE\n(Copies : 4) //True Copy// (By Order)\nTyped by: Soumya\nCompared by:Maniusha FCS: SHERISTADAR\nCriminal M.C.No.622/2025 77\n\nCopy of Order in\nCriminal M.C.No.622/2025\nDated 04/03/2025\nCriminal M.C.No.622/2025 8/7\n\n"
