M. C. ASHI, PUBLIC PROSECUTOR\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n08.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nPRE:\n2024/KER/1157\nCRL.MC NO. 82 OF 2024\n3\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.\n~ CrLLM.C.No.82 of 2024\nDated this the 8 day of January, 2024\nORDER\n\nPetitioners are accused in C.C.No.1131 of 2021 on the files of the\nJudicial First Class Magistrate's Court-I, Kottarakkara alleging offences\nunder Section 420 r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.\n\n2. According to the prosecution, the accused had, after promising\nto supply plywood, collected a cheque issued on the Federal Bank bearing\nNo.10189269 for an amount of Rs.6,00,000/- and after encashing the\nsaid cheque failed to supply the plywood and thereby committed the\noffences alleged against them.\n\n3. Sri.Latheesh Sebastian, the learned counsel for the petitioners\nsubmitted that the allegations against the petitioners do not make out\nany offence and that a civil suit is pending between the parties as\nO.S.No.340 of 2021 on the files of the Munsiff Court, Kottarakkara\nwherein the complainant has sought for recovery of money. According to\nthe petitioner, a pure commercial transaction is attempted to be\nconverted into a criminal case for the purpose of compelling the\npetitioners to yield to the illegal demands of the defacto complainant.\n\n4. I have heard Sri.M.C.Ashi, the learned Public Prosecutor as well.\n\n5. A perusal of the final report reveals that the cheque issued by the\ncomplainant was allegedly encashed by the first petitioner after promising\n\n2024/KER/1157\nCRL.MC NO. 82 OF 2024\n4\n\nto supply plywood and thereafter failed to supply the same. Even though\n\na civil suit is pending between the parties as O.S.No.340 of 2021, from\n\nthe nature of allegations, it cannot be prima facie said that it is a pure\ncivil dispute. There can be instances when a civil dispute will also have\n\nthe trappings of a criminal case. However, those are all matters for\nappreciation of evidence after due trial.\n\n6. The learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that as\nfar as the 2™ petitioner is concerned, there is absolutely no whisper or\nany material to connect him with the crime. If no materials have been\ncollected by the Investigation to implicate the 2™ petitioner, certainly it is\na matter which can be appreciated through a discharge petition as well.\n\nTherefore, reserving the liberty of the 2™ petitioner to invoke the\njurisdiction of the learned Magistrate itself, in accordance with law, this\nCrl.M.C.is dismissed.\n\nSd/-\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, JUDGE\nRKM\n\nBieipasral\nean pore a\nFe seal\nPla\n2024/KER/1157\nCRL.MC NO. 82 OF 2024\n5\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 82/2024\nPETITIONERS' ANNEXURES :\nAnnexure 1 TRUE COPY OF THE FIR ALONG WITH THE\nPRIVATE COMPLAINT IN CRIME NO. 623/2020 OF\nKOTTARAKKARA POLICE STATION\nAnnexure 2 TRUE COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT FILED BY THE\n2ND RESPONDENT IN CRIME NO. 623/2020 OF\nKOTTARAKKARA POLICE STATION\nAnnexure 3 TRUE COPY OF THE AGREEMENT DATED\n15.10.2018 EXECUTED BETWEEN THE 2ND\nPETITIONER AND THE 3RD RESPONDENT\nAnnexure 4 TRUE COPY OF THE PARTNERSHIP DEED DATED\n01.03.2019\nAnnexure 5 TRUE COPY OF THE PLAINT IN 0.S NO 340/2021\nOF MUNSIFF COURT, KOTTARAKKARA\nAnnexure 6 TRUE COPY OF THE COUNTER CLAIM OF THE 1ST\nPETITIONER IN 0.S NO.340/2021 OF MUNSIFF\nCOURT, KOTTARAKKARA\n\n"
