No.645/2025\n(Crime No. 183/2025 of Aryancode Police Station)\nPetitioner/Accused :-\nJohndrose, aged 75 years,\nS/o George Nadar, residing at\nKarunya, Thannimoodu,\nThalanira, Chemboor,\nOttasekharamangalam P.O,\nKeezharoor Village,\nThiruvananthapuram District\nBy Advocate:-S. Murukan\nCounter Petitioners:-\n1. State of Kerala\n2. The Station House Officer, Aryancodu Police Station\nBy Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumary\nThis petition came up for hearing on 01/03/2025 and the court on 03/03/2025\npassed the following :\nORDER\nThis is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik\nSuraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail.\nCriminal M.C.No.645/2025 1/5\n\n2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable\nunder Sections 74, 79, 115(2), 296(b), 329(3) and 351(2) of the Bharatiya Nyaya\nSanhita, and Crime No. 183/2025 of Aryancode Police Station is registered against\nthe petitioner, arraying him as the accused.\n\n3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- On 16.02.2025 at\nabout 4.p.m., the accused trespassed into the property of the father of the defacto\ncomplainant, situated at Thannimoodu, uttered abusive words against her and\nthreatened her with fear of death. Thereafter, the accused tore the nighty worn by\nthe defacto complainant and showed his nudity by lifting his dhothi, and fisted on\nher back.\n\n4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The\nInvestigating Officer filed report opposing the anticipatory bail application.\n\n5. Heard. Perused the records.\n\n6. The only point to be considered is, whether an order of anticipatory\nbail can be granted to the petitioner/accused.\n\n7. â€˜The Point:- The petitioner/accused and the defacto complainant are\nneighbours. The petitioner/accused is alleged to have trespassed into the property\n\nCriminal M.C.No.645/2025 2/5\n\nof the father of the defacto complainant, abused the defacto complainant, attacked\nher, tore her nighty and showed his nudity. The motive of the alleged attack is the\nanimosity out of the property dispute.\n\n8. According to the petitioner, he is absolutely innocent of the\nallegations levelled against him and no such incident has happened as alleged by\nthe prosecution. It is submitted that, the petitioner and the defacto complainant are\nneighbours and known to each other for the last 30 years, and the petitioner is\nconducting an ayurvedic shop near his house. It is also submitted that, there was\nsome property dispute between the defacto complainant and the petitioner, and he\nfiled a suit as O.S.No. 810/2024 before the Principal Munsiff Court,\nNeyyattinkara, and an injunction was granted in that suit restraining the father of\nthe defacto complainant from trespassing into his property, and in order to wreck\nvengeance, the defacto complainant has falsely foisted the present case against the\npetitioner.\n\n9. There is no serious allegation as against the petitioner. Apparently,\ncivil dispute is pending between the petitioner and the father of the defacto\ncomplainant. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that, O.S.No.\n810/2024, which is an injunction suit filed by the petitioner as against the father of\n\nCriminal M.C.No.645/2025 3/5\n\nthe defacto complainant was pending before the Principal Munsiff Court,\nNeyyattinkara, and that the petitioner had obtained an injunction order as against\nthe father of the defacto complainant and in order to wreck vengeance in view of\nthe same, this case is falsely foisted against the petitioner. In view of the civil suit,\nan element of fabrication or exaggeration of the case cannot be ruled out. The\npetitioner is an age old man. It would be a travesty of justice, if the petitioner is\nput behind the bars, if actually no offence was committed by him. No criminal\nantecedents of the petitioner is brought to the notice of this court.\n\n10. In view of my discussion above, it appears that there is no\nimpediment in granting a pre-arrest bail to the petitioner. Considering all these\naspects, it is found that this is a fit case where a pre-arrest bail can be granted to\nthe petitioner.\n\nIn the result, the petition is allowed on the following conditions:-\n\n(1) In the event of arrest, the petitioner/ accused shall be released\non bail on her executing bond for Rs.50,000/- (Rupees Fifty\nThousand only) with two solvent sureties for the like sum\neach to the satisfaction of the arresting officer/Investigating\nOfficer, as the case may be.\n\n(2) Petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer\nbetween 10 a.m. and 11 am. on every Wednesday for a\n\nCriminal M.C.No.645/2025 4/5\n\nperiod of 3 (three) months or till the filing of the final report,\n\nwhichever is earlier.\n\n(3) Petitioner shall also appear before the Investigating Officer as\nand when required.\n\n(4) Petitioner shall not commit any offence while on bail.\n\n(5) Petitioner shall not attempt to contact the defacto complainant\n\nor any of the prosecution witnesses, directly or through any\n\nother person, or in any other way try to tamper with the\n\nevidence or influence any witnesses or other persons related\n\nto the investigation.\n\nIn case of any violation of the above conditions or misuse of liberty,\nthe prosecution or the defacto complainant is at liberty to approach jurisdictional\ncourt for cancellation of bail.\n\n(Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and\npronounced by me in Open Court on this the 3 day of March 2025)\nSd/-\nNAZEERA.S\nSESSIONS JUDGE\n(Copies : 4) //True Copy// (By Order)\nTyped by: Soumya\nCompared bv:Rifa FCS : SHERISTADAR\nCriminal M.C.No.645/2025 5/5\n\nCopy of Order in\nCriminal M.C.No.645/2025\nDated 03/03/2025\nCriminal M.C.No.645/2025 6/5\n\n"
