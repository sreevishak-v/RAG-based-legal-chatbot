MC.5932/2020 2 202 URERL2O0\nV.G.ARUN, J.\nDated this the 12\" day of January, 2021\nORDER\n\nPetitioner is the 2™ accused in Crime No.665 of 2020 of\nKozhinjampara Police Station registered for offences under Sections\n41(1)(d) and 102 Cr.P.C read with 34 of IPC. The allegation is that, at\nabout 3.15 a.m on 6.10.2020, silver ornaments weighing 11.120 kg\nvalued at around Rs.3,80,000/- was seized from a lorry bearing No.TN-\n30-P-3208 and that, on questioning the driver of the lorry (3\"\naccused), it was revealed that the 3 accused was not in possession of\nany bill or other document evidencing payment of tax for the\nornaments. That, on the same day, the petitioner and the 1st accused\nwere apprehended while sitting inside a car and on questioning, it was\nadmitted that they were waiting for the silver ornaments being\nbrought by the 3% accused. Thereupon, the crime was registered, the\npetitioner and the other accused arrested and the silver ornaments\nseized.\n\n2. Later, the petitioner approached the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate Court, Chittoor seeking release of the silver ornaments\nproduced in Crime No.655 of 2020. While considering the application\nfor release, notice was issued to the State Tax Officer, SGST, Palakkad.\n\nbasen\nCr. MC.5932/2020 3 202 URERL2O0\n\nThe said officer filed a report stating that the Taxes Department\nintended to take action under Section 130 of the Central Goods and\nServices Tax Act, 2017, as the silver was transported without\ninvoices/bills etc. It was requested not to release the silver, the\napplicable tax, penalty etc. as mandated under the GST Act are paid.\nThereupon, the petitioner paid an amount of Rs.1,67,824/- and this\nfact was reported by the State Tax Officer. Since no other offence was\nmade out against the petitioner, the jurisdictional court passed\nAnnexure A3 order giving interim custody of the silver ornaments to\nthe petitioner subject to certain conditions. This Crl.M.C is filed\naggrieved by condition No.3 in Annexure A3, directing the petitioner to\nproduce the silver ornaments as and when required and not to alienate\nthe same.\n\n3. Sri.Manu Ramachandran, learned counsel for the petitioner\nsubmitted that, the petitioner having complied with the requirements\nunder the GST Act, the jurisdictional court committed an illegality in\nimposing condition No.3. It is submitted that, as the petitioner is doing\nbusiness in silver, he will have to necessarily sell the ornaments as\npart of his business and hence, unless the condition is deleted, the\npetitioner will be put to undue prejudice and loss.\n\n4. The question involved being one related to evasion of tax and\nconsequential action under the GST Act, the Special Government\nPleader (Taxes) was requested to address the — court.\n\nbisa\nCr. MC.5932/2020 4 202 URERL2O0\nSri.C.E.Unnikrishnan, learned Special Government Pleader (Taxes),\nsubmitted, on instructions, that the petitioner having remitted the\npenalty and the fine in lieu of confiscation as mandated under Section\n130(2) of the GST Act, the Taxes Department has no objection in the\nsilver being released.\n\n5. Sri.T.R.Renjit, learned Public Prosecutor submitted that, since\nthe crime is pending, release of the silver shall be on sufficient security\nand conditions.\n\n6. The offences alleged against the accused are under Sections\n41(1)(d) and 102 of Cr.P.C. The crime was registered on the accused\nfailing to produce bills or tax receipts with respect to the silver seized\nfrom the lorry. After registration of the crime, the petitioner remitted\nthe penalty and fine imposed by the Taxes Department. Condition\nNos.1 and 2 in Annexure A3 are sufficient to safeguard the interest of\nthe investigating agency.\n\nIn the result, the Crl.M.C is allowed by deleting condition No.3 in\nAnnexure A3. It is made clear that the silver ornaments seized shall be\nreleased only on the petitioner complying with condition Nos.1 and 2 in\nAnnexure A3.\n\nSd/-\nV.G.ARUN, JUDGE\nvgs\n\n5 are a\nial\nBent\n2021/KER/2030\nCrl.MC.5932/2020 5\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE Al TRUE COPY OF THE FIR IN CRIME NO.665/2020\nOF POLICE STATION , KOZHINJAMPARA , PALAKKAD\nDISTRICT.\nANNEXURE A2 THE TRUE COPY OF THE SEIZURE MAHAZAR IN\nANN.A1 FIR\nANNEXURE A3 THE TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER DATED 04.12.2020\nIN CRL.M.P.NO.2332/2020 ON THE FILES OF\nJEMC ,CHITTUR.\n\n"
