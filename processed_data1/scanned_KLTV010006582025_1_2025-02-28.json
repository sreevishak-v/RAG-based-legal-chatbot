Crux of the averments in prosecution case in Crime\nNo.1070/2024 is summarized for Crl.MC No.286/2025 as follows:-\nThe accused Nos. 1 to 12 who are respectively the President,\nSecretary and Board Member of Thiruvithamcore Co-operative\nSociety Limited T.No.1530 committed criminal breach of trust and\nmisappropriation of huge funds and caused wrongful loss to the\ncomplainant.

Both sides are heard and they would urge in tune with those\nCi. MC. Nos.277/2025,278/2025,285/2025,286/2025,287/2025 10\n\ncontentions in the bail applications and the prosecution cases\nrespectively. The learned Public Prosecutor submitted that the\nconcerned police station approached the higher police officials for\ntransferring the investigation to State Crime Branch and therefore,\nany detailed investigation was not conducted into the allegations\nlevelled in the various financial frauds alleged in the prosecution\ncases. The State Crime Branch has now taken over the investigation.\n9. The learned prosecutor produced the reports of the Deputy\nSuperintendent of Police, Crime Branch Economic Offences Wing,\nThiruvananthapuram Unit to oppose the bail applications.\n\n10. Having perused the reports of the Deputy Superintendent of\nPolice, Crime Branch and after hearing the learned counsel for the\npetitioners and Public Prosecutor, it is revealed that a more or less\nsimilar allegations are levelled against the petitioners in all the cases\nand they are primafacie punishable uw/ss 406 and 420 r/w 34 of IPC.\n11. It is informed that there are no materials in the CD as the\nSHO/IO did not conduct any detailed investigation in the past on the\nreason of awaiting Government orders pertaining to transfer the\ninvestigation to State Crime Branch due to the pendency of more\nthan 100 similar FIRâ€™s. In short, there is no effective investigation by\nthe S.H.O of two police stations into the allegations levelled against\nthe petitioners to probe their exact role in the alleged\nmisappropriation. Details of the criminal cases against the accused\nCrl. MC, Nos.277/2025,278/2025,285/2025,286/2025,287/2025 11\n\nstands narrated in column No. 16 of the police reports. Having gone\nthrough the police reports, copy of FIR and FIS, there is no specific\nallegation about the siphoning of funds of the society for own use of\nthe office bearers. Any report of the Registrar or Joint Registrar of\nthe Co-operative Societies to find out any _ instances of\nmisappropriation is not forming part of the police reports. Any\ninspection reports of any higher officials of the Co-operative\nDepartment is not forming part of the police report. Moreover, the\nallegations against the accused ought to reveal that the non-payment\nof the deposit money in the society is the dispute between the\nparties. Nature and gravity of the offences alleged against the\npetitioners ought to reveal that the same is not sufficient enough to\nplace the petitioners under custody and provide a_ custodial\ninterrogation. Having heard both sides and on perusal of the\nrecords, I do hold that the discretion of pre-arrest bail can be\nexercised in favour of the petitioners subject to conditions. Apart\nfrom that, the limited interrogation of the petitioners as\ncontemplated under the dictum of the Honâ€™ble Supreme Court in\nSushila Agarwal v. State (NCT of Delhi), 2020 SCC Online SC 98, is\nsufficient to the facts of the case.\n\n12. As far as a court considering a pre-arrest bail application is\nconcerned, the dictum of the Honâ€™ble Supreme Court in AIR 1980 SC\n1632, Gurubaksh Singh Sibbia_ and Another V. _State of Punjab holds\nCi. MC. Nos.277/2025,278/2025,285/2025,286/2025,287/2025 12\n\nthe legal position that appropriate conditions can be imposed under\nsub section 2 of S.438 of CrPC so as to ensure an uninterrupted\ninvestigation and the court can even incorporate conditions that in\nthe event of the police, making out a case of a likely discovery\nu/s.27 of Evidence Act, the person who is granted with an\nanticipatory bail can be taken into police custody for facilitating\nsuch discovery.\n13. On applying the above dictum to the facts of the case and\nafter carefully hearing the learned counsel for the petitioners and\npublic prosecutor, it is just and proper to allow the applications to\ngrant pre-arrest bail to the petitioners on conditions to co-operate\nwith the investigation.\n14. In the result, these Criminal MCs are allowed subject to the\nconditions as follows:-\n(i) The petitioners/accused Nos.9, 10 & 11 in Crl.MC\nNo.277/2025(Crime No.1440/2024); petitioners/accused Nos.9,\n10 & 11 in Crl.MC No.278/2025(Crime No.1430/2024);\npetitioners/accused Nos.9, 10 & 11 in Crl.MC No.285/2025\n(Crime No.1511/2024); petitioners/accused Nos.9, 10 & 11 in\nCrl.MC No.287/2025(Crime No.1514/2024) of Fort Police Station\nand  petitioners/accused Nos.5, 6 & 7 in  Crl.MC\nNo.286/2025(Crime No.1070/2024) of Medical College police\nCi.
