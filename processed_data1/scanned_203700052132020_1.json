Having considered the gravity of the offences alleged,\nnature of the injury caused and having perused the affidavit filed\nby the 1* respondent, the contents of which are submitted to be\ntrue and voluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled and\nthat no public interest is involved in this matter. Moreover, in\nview of the settlement, possibility of the criminal proceedings\n\nPSE\nCrmc 5213/2020 3 2021U/KER(297\nending in conviction is remote. As such, continuance of the\nproceedings will amount to an abuse of process of court and\nhence, in view of the legal position set out by the Honourable\nSupreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab\n[(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and\nanother [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is no impediment in\ngranting the relief sought.\n\n4.
