Now the case is pending as C.C.No.271/2009 before the\nsaid court. The petitioners' case is as follows :\n\nThe first petitioner availed a loan from the complainant bank to\npurchase an excavator. Now, the amount due is Rs.7,00,000/-. When\nthe petitioner defaulted instalments, the above said complaint is filed\nalleging that the excavator was transferred to the second petitioner and\nalso that material alterations are made on the vehicle. Thereafter, the\nsecond petitioner appeared before the court and stated by an affidavit\nthat he had not purchased the vehicle and he got no right over the\nvehicle. It is also the case of the petitioner that the loan amount has\nbeen repaid. Notice issued to the complainant who is shown as\n\nLe\n2017/KER/2075\nCrl.M.C.No.3342/2013 2\nrespondent No.2 before this court. No representation for the said bank\nfor today before this court. There is nothing to disbelieve the case of\nthe petitioner that the above said Rs.7,00,000/- was repaid.\n\n2. The only question before this court is that whether there is\ningredients to attract an offence under Section 420 of IPC. It can be\nseen that the bank got no case that at the time of availing the loan itself,\nthe petitioner was having criminal intention to cheat the bank and avail\nRs.7,00,000/- and thereafter not to repay the amount. It appears that\nthe grievance was that the vehicle was transferred to the second\npetitioner and thereafter repayments were defaulted. When the\ningredients of an offence under Section 420 is lacking, there will be no\nnecessity to proceed with a case like this. Admittedly, the complainant\nis a financial institution which is advancing amounts to the persons\nrequesting and entitled for the same. There is no case that any forged\ndocument was produced or false representation was made so as to avail\nthe loan. In the charge sheet also, it is stated as follows :\n\n1-)0 mvoesi] moeme2oow! e0ef GM0AH] AIQAM aHOGMIds)Bo\n\nBleha ell\nao\n2017/KER/2075\nCrl.M.C.No.3342/2013 3\naloendlasgemss HDFC sisal MIM}o Gales oGyS}OO\nAM MAGAIQS aHM AloUsMdl GabeMlaw@o MINIM Mem 1-)0\n(a 1Oy1e6) AN@ajm MSGOZMOVNeM9 2-)0 (al@y16) a1068)\nMAAUMILN}MONEMD GAIGAD ENUIAIEGHD MA/WICWae)  1-)0\n(eIMI@ae) 1-)0 MIdaMlaw AmMigleflaf al AaIgZIMolM} Galené)\nsniomlodo asadinmalenss TATA HITACHI agmaeaigé 25.11.2008\nMIMD] 2-)0 (21G10,A00!
