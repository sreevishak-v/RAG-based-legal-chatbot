Thereafter, the matrimonial relationship got spoiled\nleading to the laying of a FIS by the second respondent. It was\nalleged by her that, she was subjected to matrimonial cruelty by the\nhusband and the in-laws. Accordingly, crime was registered as\nCrime No.3423 of 2015 of Thrissur Town East Police Station for\noffences punishable under sections 406, 498A and 34 of the Indian\nPenal Code. Annexure-A is the FIS. After completion of\ninvestigation, final report was laid and the matter is now pending as\nC.C.No.602 of 2015 of Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Thrissur.\n\n2. Crl.M.C is laid by the accused on a premise that the\ndispute with the defacto complainant has been completely settled to\nher satisfaction and both parties have decided to get the\nmatrimonial relationship seperated by due process of law. It is\nsubmitted that joint application for judicial separation was filed\nunder section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act and is pending before\nthe Family Court, Thrissur.\n\n3. In the light of the settlement between the parties, no\npurpose will be served by prosecuting the petitioners herein.\n\n2018/KER/506\nCri.M.C.8508/17\n2\nAccordingly, Crl.M.C is filed.\n\n4. Learned counsel for the petitioners and learned counsel\nfor the second respondent reiterated the settlement arrived at\nbetween the parties on the strength of Annexure-B affidavit filed by\nthe second respondent. Having considered the submission of the\nlearned Public Prosecutor that the matter has been settled between\nthe parties and reported to the police, I am inclined to hold that, no\npurpose will be served by prosecuting the petitioners herein.\n\nIn the result, Crl.M.C is allowed. All further proceedings\narising from Crime No.3423 of 2015 of Thrissur Town East Police\nStation in C.C.No.602 of 2015 of Chief Judicial Magistrate Court,\nThrissur will stand quashed.\n\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS\nJudge\nSbna/5/1/18\nTrue Copy / P A to Judge\n\n"
