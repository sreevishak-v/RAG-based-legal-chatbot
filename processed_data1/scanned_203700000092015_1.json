TO JUDGE\nbp\n\nP.UBAID, J. 2015/KER/210\n\"Cr M.C..Mo. 9 OF 2015\nDated this the 6\" day of January, 2015\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner herein is the original second accused in\nC.C. No.161/2006 of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-I,\nHosdurg. Of the ten accused in the case, seven faced trial in\nC.C. No.161/2006 and obtained a judgment of acquittal when\nthe prosecution failed to procure the presence of the material\nwitnesses during trial. The case against the original accused\nNos.2,4 & 5 was split up and refiled as C.C. No.612/2008.\nLater, the original accused No.5 also got acquittal in C.C.\nNo,612/2008 on 24/1/2011 when the material witness did not\nsupport the prosecution. The case against the original accused\nNos. 2 & 4 was again split up and refiled. Later, the case\nagainst the original 4‘ accused was quashed by this Court as\nper the order dated 8/2/2013 in Crl.M.C. No.369/2013. Now,\nthe case against the petitioner is pending as C.C.\nNo.1587/2013. He also seeks orders quashing the\nprosecution on the ground that he and the de fcto complainant\nhave come to terms amicably out of Court. The de facto\n\n2015/KER/210\n\nCrI.M.C. .No.9 of 2015 22:\n\ncomplainant C.P.Mahamood is the 2™ respondent in this\nproceeding. He has filed affidavit to the effect that he has\nsettled the whole dispute with the accused, and he has no\ngrievance or complaint. The offence involved in this case are\nunder Sections 143,147,148 & 324 read with Section 149 of\nIPC. Since composition is not possible, orders are sought under\nSection 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. All the other\naccused in the crime stand acquitted. In such a situation,\ncontinuance of the prosecution, as against the petitioner herein,\nwill not serve any purpose other than wasting the precious time\nof the court. Nobody will support the prosecution if the case\ngoes to trial.\n\nIn the result, the Crl.M.C. is allowed. The prosecution\nagainst the petitioner in C.C. No.1587/2013 of the Judicial First\nClass Magistrate Court-I, Hosdurg, will stand quashed under\nSection 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Accordingly, the\npetitioner will stand released from the prosecution, and the bail\nbond, if any, executed by him will stand discharged.\n\nSd/-\nP.UBAID, Judge.\ndpk /True copy/ PS to Judge.\n\nDl Dal\nae cet wie\nier\nrao 2\n2015/KER/210\nCrl.M.C. .No.9 of 2015 2:3:\n\n"
