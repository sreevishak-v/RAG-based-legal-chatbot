Moreover, in view\nof the settlement, possibility of the\ncriminal proceedings ending in conviction is\nremote. As such, continuance of the\nproceedings will amount to an abuse of\nprocess of court and hence, in view of the\nlegal position set out by the Honourable\nSupreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v.
