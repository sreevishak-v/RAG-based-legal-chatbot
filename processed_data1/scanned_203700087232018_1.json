SRI.P.I.GHORGEKUTTY\nPUBLIC PROSECUTOR SRI RAMESH CHAND\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n09.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nCrl.MC.No. 8723 of 2018 2 201S1KER/T239\nORDER\n\nPetitioner was the first accused in\nC.C.No.84 of 2006 n the file of the Chief\nJudicial Magistrate Court, Kottayam. He along\nwith the second accused was charged with having\ncommitted the offences under Section 420 IPC.\nOn his failure to appear in the court\nproceedings under Sections 82 and 83 were\ninitiated. Still he did not appear. His case\nwas removed to the register of long pending\ncases, the number being L.P.No.7/2011. The co-\naccused was tried and acquitted. Tt is stated\nthat the order removing the case of the\npetitioner to the register of long pending cases\nwas illegal. It is further submitted that the\nmatter has been settled between the petitioner\nand the second respondent who is the victim.\nThe proceedings are sought to be quashed.\n\n2. Heard the learned counsel for the\n\nCrl.MC.No. 8723 of 2018 3 2019/KER/1239\npetitioner and the second respondent and the\nlearned Public Prosecutor.\n\n3. The proceedings against the petitioner\nunder Sections 82 and 83 were simultaneously\ninvolved by the trial court. This court in\n“Molly Vs. State [1994(1)KLJ 930]” held that\nsuch a procedure is illegal. So the order of\ntransferring the case to the register of long\npending cases was illegal.\n\n4. I have perused the Annexure A2 Judgment\nby which the co-accused was acquitted. The\nSecond respondent has entered appearance through\ncounsel. T am satisfied that the matter has\nbeen settled. The proceedings against the\npetitioner are liable to be quashed.\n\nIn the result this Crl1.M.C. is allowed. The\norder by which the case of the petitioner was\nremoved to the register of long pending cases is\nset aside. The proceedings against the\n\nBape bel\n|\noes aa\nCr1.MC.No. 8723 of 2018 4 2019/KER/1239\npetitioner in C.C.No.33 of 2010, which was\nrefiled from C.C.No.84 of 2006 are quashed.\nSd/-\nK.ABRAHAM MATHEW\nJUDGE\nMC/10.01.19\n\nra ks ae c|\nae ene\nCrl.MC.No. 8723 of 2018 5 2019/KER/1239\nAPPENDIX\n\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\n\nANNEXURE-A1 CERTIFIED COPY OF THE COMPLAINT IN CC\n84/2006 BEFORE THE HONOURABLE CHIEF\nJUDICIAL MAGISTRATE COURT, KOTTYAM.\n\nANNEXURE-A2 A TRUE COPY OF THE JUDGMENT IN cc\n84/2006 DATED 19/06/2010\n\nANNEXURE-A3 A TRUE COPY OF THE CERTIFIED COPY OF\nTHE APPLICATION FILED BY THE 1ST\nRESPONDENT TO ENABLE HIM TO COMPOUND\nTHE MATTER WITH THE PETITIONER.\n\nANNEXURE-A4 CERTIFIED COPY OF THE ORDER DATED\n7/7/2018\n\nANNEXURE-A5 A TRUE COPY OF THE SUMMONS AND THE\nENDORSEMENT REGARDING THE SERVICE OF\nSUMMONS\n\nANNEXURE-A6 THE TRUE COPY OF THE READABLE COPY OF\nTHE ORDER SHEET IN CC NO. 84 OF 2006.\n\nRESPONDENT'S/S EXHIBITS:\n\nNIL\n\nMC\n\n(TRUE COPY) PA TO JUDGE\n\n"
