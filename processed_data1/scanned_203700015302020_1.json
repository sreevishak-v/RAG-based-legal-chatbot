A.MOHAMMED SAVAD\nOTHER PRESENT:\n\nPP RENJITH T.R.\n\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n\n06.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nBitee\nCrl.MC.No.1530 OF 2020 (A) 3... 202 1/KERIT00\nORDER\n\nDated this the 6th day of January 2021\n\nPetitioners are accused Nos.1 to 5 and 7 in\nCrime No.3/2020 registered at the Eravipuram Police\nStation for offences punishable under Sections 143,\n147, 148, 341, 294(b), 506, 323, 324, 307 r/w 149 of\nIPC. The de facto complainant, at whose instance the\ncrime was registered, is arrayed as the 3”\nrespondent. Annexure-A3 affidavit has been filed by\n3™ respondent stating that the dispute, which was the\nreason for the incident and registration of the crime,\nhas been resolved amicably and he has no subsisting\ngrievance against the petitioners.\n\n2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also,\nwho, on instructions, submits that the petitioners\nhave no criminal antecedents.\n\nCrl.MC.No.1530 OF 2020 (A) AL, 202 1/KERIT00\n\n3. Having considered the gravity of the offences\nalleged, nature of the injury caused and having\nperused the affidavit filed by the 3 respondent, the\ncontents of which are submitted to be true and\nvoluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled and\nno public interest is involved in this matter. Though,\nthere is an allegation that the petitioners have\ncommitted offence under Section 307 of IPC, perusal\nof the wound certificate shows that the reason of the\nthe injury was stated to a road traffic accident. In\nAnnexure-A2 order, by which this Court had granted\nbail to the petitioners also observed that the\npetitioners had suffered a lacerated wound which\ncoincides with the story of the injury being sustained\nin the road traffic accident. Moreover, in view of the\nsettlement, possibility of the criminal proceedings\nending in conviction is remote. As such, continuance\n\nCrl.MC.No.1530 OF 2020 (A) Be. amikeR70\nof the proceedings will amount to an abuse of process\nof court and hence, in view of the legal position set\nout by the Honourable Supreme Court in Madan\nMohan Abbot v. State of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC\n582] and Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and\nanother [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is no impediment\nin granting the relief sought.\n\nIn the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. Annexure-\nAl FIR and the proceedings in Crime No.3/2020\nregistered at the Eravipuram Police Station is\nquashed.\nSd/-\nV.G.ARUN\nSB/06/01/2020 JUDGE\n\nese\nce\n| Soa 4!\nCrl.MC.No.1530 OF 2020(A) .6.. 2021/KER/700\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE-A1 THE CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FIR 3/2020\nOF THE ERAVIPURAM POLICE STATION\nDATED 01.01.2020\nANNEXURE-A2 THE TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER DATED\n16.01.2020 IN BA 177/2020 OF THE\nHON'BLE HIGH COURT OF KERALA\nANNEXURE-A3 THE AFFIDAVIT EXECUTED BY THE 3RD\nRESPONDENT DATED 31/01/2020\nANNEXURE-A4 THE AFFIDAVIT DATED 29.07.2020\nEXECUTED BY ADARSH\nANNEXURE-A5 THE AFFIDAVIT DATED 26.11.2020\nEXECUTED BY DURGADAS\nANNEXURE-A6 THE AFFIDAVIT DATED 26/11/2020\nEXECUTED BY SHAMNAD\nANNEXURE-A7 THE AFFIDAVIT DATED 26/11/2020\nEXECUTED BY AKHIL\n//true copy// P.A to Judge\n\n"
