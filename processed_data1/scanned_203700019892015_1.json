No.1989 of 2015\nDated this the 21\" day of April, 2015.\nORDER\nPetitioner is the accused in Crime No.294/2015 of\nAlathur Police Station. He is the Secretary of the\nSociety by mame “Brahmananda Swami Sivayogi\nEducational Society” (“the Society” for short)\nregistered under the Societies Registration Act. He is\ngranted with an anticipatory bail. But he is aggrieved\nby condition No.3 in the order granting pre-arrest\nbail. According to the petitioner, being the Secretary\nof the Society, which is being functioned in the\npremises of the school, the condition No.3 prohibiting\nhis entry into the premises of BSS Sidhasramam or at\nthe premises of BSS Gurukulam HSS is illegal,\nirrational and liable to be deleted. His position as\nthe Secretary of the Society is evidenced by\nAnnexure-II order issued by the District Registrar.\nBut as per condition No.3 of the impugned order he\n\nBae\n2015/KER/17252\nCrl.M.C.1989/15-C :2:\ncannot enter into the Society enabling him to\ndischarge the duties as the Secretary of the Society.\n\n2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner\nand the learned Public Prosecutor.\n\n3. Indisputably, the petitioner is the Secretary\nof the Society, as the same is evidenced by\nAnnexure-II order. If that be so, he has the right to\nenter into the Society, which is being functioned in\nthe premises of the school and he cannot be prevented\nfrom exercising that right. Having regard to the said\nfacts, condition No.3 in the impugned order will stand\nmodified to the extent that the petitioner is allowed\nto enter into the office of the Society only, which is\nbeing functioned in the premises of the above school:\nbut he cannot enter into Sidhasramam or BSS\ngurukulam HSS.\n\nThis petition is disposed of.\n\nsd/-\n(K.HARILAL, JUDGE)\nokb.\n\n"
