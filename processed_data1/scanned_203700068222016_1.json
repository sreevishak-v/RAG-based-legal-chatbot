On 17/4/2010, the Excise Party intercepted the first\naccused who was found to have been concealing spirit. Crime was\nregistered against the first accused. The petitioner herein was also\nincluded in the array of the accused on the basis of the statement\ngiven by the first accused that it was the second accused who had\nsupplied the spirit.\n\n3. Contending that, apart from the alleged confession\nstatement of the co-accused , there is no other material to connect\nthe petitioner herein with the crime and that the alleged confession\nwill not stand in the eye of law, the petitioner seeks to quash the\nproceedings.\n\n4. Learned Public Prosecutor also, with reference to the\navailable materials, fairly admitted that the only material relied on\nby the prosecution is the confession of the first accused.\n\n5. It is settled by the various decisions that co-accused cannot\nbe roped in with the aid of the statement of the other accused.\n\nel\n2017/KER/1512\n\nCri.M.C.BNo.6822/2016 2.\n\nLearned counsel for the petitioner further relied on Annexure C\n\nand D judgments wherein relying on the decision reported in Lissy\nKurian v. State of Kerarla [2004 (1) KLJ 877), this Court has\n\nheld that confession of co-accused cannot be by itself the sole basis\n\nfor implication.\n\n6. I am satisfied that the above decision is squarely applicable\nto the the facts of this case. In the light of the above, the\nsuccessful prosecution against the petitioner herein on the basis of\nthe available materials may not be legally sustainable. In the light\nof the above, I am inclined to allow the Crl.M.C.\n\nIn the result, Crl.M.C.is allowed. All further proceedings in\nrelation to the petitioner herein pursuant to Annexure-B final\nreport of the Addl.Sessions Court No.IV, Palakkad stand quashed.\n\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS\nJudge\ndpk\n/true copy/ PS to Judge\n\noo\nBaa ion eel\nBeat\n2017/KER/1512\nCri.M.C.BNo.6822/2016 2.\n\n"
