Complaint\nwas laid by the de facto complainant and after investigation, final\nreport was laid. Matter is now pending as C.C.No.213 of 2013 of\nJudicial First Class Magistrate Court-I, Kasaragod.\n\n3. Petitioners approached this Court contending that the\ndisputes between the parties have been voluntarily settled. An\naffidavit has been filed by the de facto complainant as Annexure-A2\ntouching upon the settlement arrived at. It is asserted in the\naffidavit that the de facto complainant does not propose to pursue\nthe matter in the light of the settlement arrived at between the\nparties. Learned Public Prosecutor on instructions submitted that\n\nBl\nBe\n2017/KER/957\nCri.M.C.7585/16\n2\n\nthe parties are not involved in any other crime and that, they have\nvoluntarily settled the dispute.
