TO JUDGE\nPn\n\nDe\n2018/KER/513\nSUNIL THOMAS, J.\nDated this the 5\" day of January, 2018\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner stands arrayed as an accused in Crime\nNo.989/2011 of Chathannoor Police Station now pending as S.C.\nNo.139/2012 of IV Additional Sessions Court, Kollam for offences\npunishable under Sections 376, 450, 506(ii) and 341 of IPC. The\ncrux of the allegation was that, on 06.07.2011 at 12.00 noon, the\npetitioner trespassed into the house of the de facto complainant\nand committed rape on her. Witnesses were examined to support\nthe prosecution case. In the course of investigation, the\npetitioner was subjected to a potency test. Annexure 7 is the\nCertificate of Potency dated 09.07.2011 issued by an Assistant\nSurgeon of the District Hospital, Kollam, by which the final opinion\nwas reserved pending the report of urological examination. | It\nseems that the petitioner was not subjected to a urological\nexamination in the course of investigation. After the examination\nof CW 22, who was examined as PW 15 and after marking of\nExhibits P1 to P20, it seems that the prosecution noticed the\nabove and filed an application for subjecting the petitioner to a\nurological examination. The court below by the impugned order\n\nrepeat\n2018/KER/513\n\nCri. M. C. No. 8796 of 2017 2\n\nin Cr.M.P. No.1949/2017 allowed the application directing the\npetitioner to appear before the Urologist, District Hospital, Kollam\n\non 18.12.2017 at 9.00 a.m. for examination by the Urologist. This\norder is challenged in this proceedings. Having regard to the\nnature of the relief sought, | am not inclined to issue notice to the\n\n3 respondent, since the matter itself can be disposed of without\n\nher presence.\n\n2. The specific contention of the learned counsel for the\npetitioner is that in the nature of allegation raised against him,\nthe potency and the capability of the petitioner herein to enter\ninto physical relationship is crucial. It is contended that the\npotency certificate issued by the Doctor in the above\ncircumstance without a urological examination at that point of\ntime, is a very valuable defence which has accrued to him, due to\nthe lapse of time and the laches on the part of the prosecution\nand the consequent lacuna cannot be filled up at this length of\ntime by directing the petitioner to undergo a_ urological\nexamination. It was further contended that the petitioner had\ncertain physiological defects affecting his potency at the time of\ninvestigation and that he was taking medicines for that. Further\n\n2018/KER/513\nCri. M. C. No. 8796 of 2017 3\ncontention advanced at the time of hearing is that, even if he has\ngained physical ability now, that cannot relate back to the date of\noriginal examination of him on 09.07.2011.\n\n3. Definitely, this is a valuable defence available to the\npetitioner. However, having regard to the fact that even if the\npetitioner undergoes urological examination, the court below will\nhave to appreciate the validity of that document specifically\nhaving regard to the delay that has occurred in undergoing the\nurological test and also the question whether the report given at a\nsubsequent stage can relate back to the actual physical capacity\nas on the date of incident, are matters to be specifically\nconsidered by the court below, while appreciating evidence.\nReserving this right, | am inclined to dispose of the Crl.M.C. with a\ndirection that the petitioner shall appear before the court below\non the next posting date, on which day, the court shall fix a date\nfor appearance of the petitioner for urological examination.\nThereafter, the court may proceed in accordance with law and\nwhile appreciating the evidence, the court shall take note of the\nobservations made above.\n\n4. The warrant issued by the court below in the above\n\nRal\nBane\n2018/KER/513\nCri. M. C. No. 8796 of 2017 4\ncircumstance, will be kept in abeyance till the date of his\nappearance before the court below on the next posting date, on\nwhich day, the court below shall consider his application for\nwithdrawal of the warrant, considering the fact that he had\napproached this Court challenging the impugned order.\nCrl.M.C. is disposed of as above.\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE.\nPn\n\n"
