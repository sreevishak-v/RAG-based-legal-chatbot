BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR, HIGH COURT OF KERALA,\nERNAKULAM-682031, THROUGH STATION HOUSE OFFICER, HARIPAD\nPOLICE STATION, ALAPPUZHA DISTRICT,\nBY SRI.C.N.PRABHAKARAN, SENIOR PUBLIC PROSECUTOR\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 05-01-2018,\nTHE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\nRAV\n\n2018/KER/455\nSUNIL THOMAS, J\nCri.M.C.No.106 of 2018\nDated this the 5 day of January, 2018\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner herein is the sole accused in\nCC.No.501/2013 of Judicial First Class Magistrate\nCourt-II, Haripad arising from Crime No.519/2012 of\nHaripad Police Station for offences punishable under\nsection 498A of the Indian Penal Code.\n\n2. According to the petitioner herein, he was\ngranted bail by this court and accordingly he had\nappeared before the court below and was enlarged on\nbail. The matter was referred for Adalath. In the\nmeanwhile, the petitioner went abroad. The mediation\nhad failed. Since he did not appear before the court\nbelow, non bailable warrant was issued. Since his\npresence could not be procured, the case was consigned\nto the LP register and is now pending as LP.No.30/2015.\n\n3. The petitioner herein contends that the\npetitioner is willing to appear before the court below and\n\nCrl.M.C.No.106 of 2018 NEES\n2\n\nto participate in all further proceedings by his personal\nattendance or through hisâ€™ counsel. The only\napprehension of the petitioner herein is that, since non\nbailable warrant was ordered, and the case considered\n\nthe LP register, there is a possibility that the bail\napplication proposed to be filed by him is not likely to be\n\ntaken up on the same day and he may be remanded.\n\n4. Having considered the explanation offered\nthat the petitioner herein was abroad and also\nconsidering the nature of allegations which is only one\nunder section 498A, arising from a matrimonial dispute,\nI feel that the request made by the petitioner herein is\nreasonable and can be granted. Essentially, the non\nbailable warrant is issued to procure the presence of the\naccused and if once it is ensured, there is no reason as\nto why he should be remanded. Having considered\nthese facts, I am inc lied to dispose of the Crl.M.C with a\ndirection that the petitioner herein shall appear before\nthe court below within a period of ten days from today\nand file appropriate applications for recalling the warrant\n\nPieieias hl\napt\n2018/KER/455\nCrl.M.C.No.106 of 2018\n3\nand also for bail. He shall deposit a sum of Rs.5000/-\ntowards the portion of the bond amount before the court\nbelow. If the above conditions are satisfied, the court\nbelow shall take up the applications to be filed by the\npetitioner herein, on the same day of his appearance\nitself and pass appropriate orders on the same day\nhaving regard to what is stated above. The warrant\nissued by the court below will be kept in abeyance till\nhis actual date of appearance within the above ten days.\nCri.M.C is disposed of as above.\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE\nR.AV\n//True Copy//\nPA to Judge\n\n"
