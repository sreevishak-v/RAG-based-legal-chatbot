The allegation of the prosecution is that on 01.01.2014,\nthe car belonging to the petitioner herein was found loaded with\n168 liters of spirit and left abandoned. Crime was registered and\nmatter is now pending as C.P.No.39 of 2016 of Judicial First Class\nMagistrate Court-III, Palakkad. Petitioner submits that he was not\narrested nor he was aware of the entire proceedings. Having come\nto know about the pendency of proceedings, he has approached this\nCourt stating that he is ready and willing to appear before the court\nbelow and to seek his relief there. The apprehension of the\npetitioner is that in the event of his appearance, the court below\nmay not consider the bail application on the same day, considering\nthe fact that it is a matter exclusively triable by the Sessions Court.\n\n3. Having regard to these facts, I feel that the petitioner\nherein may be permitted to surrender before the jurisdictional\n\n: apna a\nRe\n2017/KER/227\nCrl.M.C.20/17\n2\nmagistrate within a period of 10 days from today and seek\nappropriate relief. In the event of his filing of an application, court\nbelow shall take up the application on the same day itself, having\nregard to the above facts.\nCrl.M.C. is disposed of as above.\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS\nJudge\nSbna/4/1/17\nTrue Copy /\nPA to Judge\n\n"
