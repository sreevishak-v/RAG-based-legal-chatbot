SRI.SUNU P.JOHN\nR1 BY SRI.SANTOSH PETER, SR.PP\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON\n08.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\n—\nOPE\nCrl.MC.No.3615 OF 2013 2 2021/KER/1229\nORDER\nDated this the 8th day of January 2021\n\nThe petitioner is the accused in C.P No.23/2013 on the file of\nthe Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kolencherry. The above\ncase is chargesheeted against the petitioner alleging offences\npunishable under Sections 23 and 26 of the Juvenile Justice (Care\nand Protection of Children) Act, 2000 (for short 'the JJ Act’).\n\n2. The prosecution case is that on 17.10.2011 at about\n5.40 pm, charge witness No.1, the Sub Inspector of Police,\nAmbalamedu Police Station while on patrolling duty found charge\nwitness No.2 Saravanan, aged 16 years near Eathikkara, Kappela.\nWhen the child was questioned, he deposed that from June\nonwards, the petitioner kept minor Saravanan for the purpose of\nhazardous employment at his shop No.II/235 of Thiruvaniyoor\nGrama Panchayath and assaulted him. So the accused is alleged\nto have committed offences punishable under Sections 23 and 26\nof the JJ Act.\n\n3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the\nlearned Public Prosecutor.\n\n—\nope\nCri.MC.No.3615 OF 2013 3 2021/KER/1229\n\n4. The counsel for the petitioner submitted that even if\nthe entire allegations are accepted, the offence under Sections\n23 and 26 of the JJ Act is not attracted in the facts and\ncircumstances of the case. The counsel submitted that\nAnnexure 3 is the transfer certificate of the child issued by the\nHead Master, U.M UP School, Meenakshi Nagar, Madurai East,\nMadurai in which the date of birth of the petitioner is\nmentioned as 26.5.1993. The counsel submitted that the\nalleged incident in this case is happened on 17.10.2011.\nAccording to the counsel, as on that date the 2\"* respondent is\naged more than 18 years and therefore the offence is not prima\nfacie made out. The counsel also submitted that even if the\naverments in the final report is accepted, the offences under\nSections 23 and 26 of the JJ Act is not attracted in the facts and\ncircumstances of the case. According to the counsel, even the\njob allegedly given to the child is not hazardous in nature.\n\n5. The Public Prosecutor submitted that the offence\nunder Sections 23 and 26 of the JJ Act is attracted in this case\nand it is a matter of evidence and this Court may not interfere\nwith the final report under Section 482 CrPC\n\n6. When this Crl.M.C came up for consideration, this\nCourt admitted the case and a stay order was also passed. This\n\nope 10]\n-\nEEE ‘a\nCrl.MC.No.3615 OF 2013 4 202UKER/1229\nCriminal Miscellaneous Case is pending before this Court from\n2013 onwards.\n7. The main allegation in Annexure 2 final report is\nextracted hereunder:\n\"EPOaJOODlOIAIOO AGlaoas aan esdeil o.rigilenrd\naDSle] aMMss Moac Mlainileldlaca EQao@dladacmM EG\nCOANCWHRHOAIOS CIOS OCT Helle?

Sections 23 and 26 of the JJ Act is extracted\nhereunder:\n“23. Punishment for cruelty to juvenile or child.—\nWhoever, having the actual charge of, or control over, a juvenile\nor the child, assaults, abandons, exposes or wilfully neglects the\njuvenile or causes or procures him to be assaulted, abandoned,\nexposed or neglected in a manner likely to cause such juvenile\nor the child unnecessary mental or physical suffering shall be\npunishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to\nsix months, or fine, or with both.\n\n26. Exploitation of juvenile or child employee.—Whoever\nostensibly procures a juvenile or the child for the purpose of any\nhazardous employment keeps him in bondage and withholds his\nearnings or uses such earning for his own purposes shall be\npunishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to\n\n—\nOPE\nCri.MC.No.3615 OF 2013 5 2021/KER/1229\nthree years and shall also be liable to fine.”\n\n9. After going through the averments in the final report,\naccording to me, it is very difficult to accept the prosecution\ncase that the petitioner committed the offences under Sections\n23 and 26 of the JJ Act. The petitioner has got a case based on\nAnneuxre 3 transfer certificate that as on the date of the\nalleged incident, the 2\"! respondent is aged more than 18 years.\nMoreover, to attract the offence under Section 23 of the JJ Act,\nthe prosecution has to establish that the accused is having the\nactual charge of, or control over, a juvenile or the child and he\nassaults, abandons, exposes or wilfully neglects the juvenile or\ncauses or procures him to be assaulted, abandoned, exposed or\nneglected in a manner likely to cause such juvenile or the child\nunnecessary mental or physical suffering. There is no evidence\nto prima facie show that the petitioner assaults, abandons,\nexposes or wilfully neglects the juvenile. Similarly to attract\nSection 26 of the Act the accused should ostensibly procures a\njuvenile or the child for the purpose of any hazardous\nemployment keeps him in bondage and withholds his earnings\nor uses such earning for his own purposes. There is no\nevidence even to show that the employment was hazardous in\nnature. Therefore, even if the entire allegations in the final\n\n—\nope\nCri.MC.No.3615 OF 2013 6 2021/KER/1229\nreport are accepted, according to me, the offences under\nSections 23 and 26 of the JJ Act is not attracted.\n\n10. Moreover, as per Annexure 3 transfer certificate, the\nage of the 2\" respondent will be more than 18 years as on the\ndate of the alleged incident. Considering the entire facts and\ncircumstances of the case, according to me, the continuation of\nthe proceedings against the petitoiner is an abuse of process of\nlaw.\n\nTherefore, this Crl.M.C is allowed. All further proceedings\nin C.P No.23/2013 on the file of the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate Court, Kolencherry are quashed.\n\nSd/-\nP.V.KUNHIKRISHNAN\nJUDGE\nab\n\nBre Yo]\nLe\niva\nBesa\nCri.MC.No.3615 OF 2013 7 2021/KER/1229\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANX.I CERTIFIED COPY OF FIR IN CRIME NO. 424/2011 OF\nPUTHENCRUZ POLICE STATION DATED 21-10-2011.\nANX.II CERTIFIED COPY OF FINAL REPORT IN CRIME NO.\n424/2011 OF PUTHENCRUZ POLICE STATION DATED 30-1-2012.\nANX.III TRANSFER CERTIFICATE OF P.
