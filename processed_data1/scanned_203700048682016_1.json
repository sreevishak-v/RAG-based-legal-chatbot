TO JUDGE\nmbr/\n\nnee\n2016/KER/33671\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN, V., J.\nDated this the 1° day of August, 2016\nORDER\n\n1.A lorry bearing registration No. KL-07-BD-8169 owned by\nthe 1* petitioner and another lorry bearing Reg.No.KL-36-\n8449 belonging to the 3™ petitioner was seized by the 2\"°\nrespondent on 27.7.2016, alleging commission of offence\nunder the Kerala Minerals (Prevention of illegal Mining,\nStorage and Transportation) Rules, 2015 (hereinafter\n\nreferred to as “the Transportation Rules, 2015”).\n2.As per Rule 32 of the Transportation Rules, 2015, any\noffence punishable under the said rules can be\ncompounded, either before or after the institution of the\nprosecution, by the person authorized under Section 22 of\nthe Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act,\n\nnee\n2016/KER/33671\n\nCriI.M.C. No.4868 of 2016 -2-\n1957 or clause (ii) of Rule 2 of the Transportation Rules,\n2015, to make a complaint to the Court with respect to\nthat offence, on payment to that person, for credit to the\nGovernment, of such sum as that person may specify.\nReferring to Annexure-A3, it is submitted that the 3”\nrespondent is the officer authorised to make a complaint\nto the Court or to compound the offence.\n\n3.The grievance of the petitioners is that the vehicles have\nnot been produced before the 3” respondent till date. The\nprayer in this petition is to issue direction to the 2\"\nrespondent to act in terms of the Transportation Rules,\n2105 and to produce the vehicles seized before the 3”\nrespondent. It is further prayed that directions be issued\nto the 3% respondent to provide an opportunity to the\npetitioners to compound the offence under Rule 32 of the\nTransportation Rules, 2015.\n\n4.I have heard the learned Public Prosecutor as well.\n\nBae\nape\n2016/KER/33671\n\nCri.M.C. No.4868 of 2016 -3-\n\n5.I find considerable merit in the submission of the learned\ncounsel. It is evident on a reading of Rule 32 of the\nTransportation Rules, 2015 and also S.R.O No. 375 of\n2015 produced by the petitioners that the 3% respondent\nis the competent authority to prefer complaint before the\nlearned Magistrate and also to allow the compounding of\nthe offence. Hence, the following directions are issued, to\nsecure the ends of justice :-\n\ni. The 2™ respondent is directed to produce\nthe aforesaid vehicles involved in the offence\nbefore the 3% respondent within a period of\ntwo days from the date of receipt of a copy of\nthis order.\n\nii. The 3% respondent shall permit the\npetitioners to compound the offence under Rule\n32 of the Rules, if the same is permissible\nunder law.\n\nii. The above endeavour shall be completed\nwithin a period of 5 days from the date of\nreceipt of this order.\n\nBae\nape\n2016/KER/33671\nCri.M.C. No.4868 of 2016 -4-\nIf the offence is compounded in terms of Rule 32 of the\nTransportation Rules, 2015, necessarily the vehicles\nshall be released forthwith. This petition is disposed\noff.\nSd/-\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN, V.\nJUDGE\nPs/1/8/16\n\n"
