CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n07.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nâ€”\nDae\nCrl.MC.No.5643 OF 2020 (E) LoB.. 202 UKER/TII2\nORDER\nDated this the 7th day of January 2021\nPetitioner is the accused in Crime No.121/2016\nregistered at the Bakel Police Station for the offence\npunishable under Section 324 of IPC, now pending as\nC.C.No.17/2020 on the files of the Juvenile Justice\nBoard, Kasaragod. The de facto complainant and the\nother persons injured are arrayed as respondents 3 to\n6. Annexures A3 to A6 affidavits have been filed by\nthe said respondents stating that the dispute, which\nwas the reason for the incident and registration of the\ncrime, has been resolved amicably and they have no\nsubsisting grievance against the petitioners.\n2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also,\nwho, on instructions, submits that the petitioner has\n\nDae\nCrl.MC.No.5643 OF 2020 (&) AL, 2021/KERITII2\nno criminal antecedents.\n\n3. Having considered the gravity of the offences\n\nalleged, nature of the injury caused and having\nperused the affidavits filed by respondents 3 to 6, the\ncontents of which are submitted to be true and\nvoluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled\nand no public interest is involved in this matter.\nMoreover, in view of the settlement, possibility of the\ncriminal proceedings ending in conviction is remote.\nAs such, continuance of the proceedings will amount\nto an abuse of process of court and hence, in view of\nthe legal position set out by the Honourable Supreme\nCourt in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab\n[(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh v. State of\nPunjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is\nno impediment in granting the relief sought.\n\nLe\nDee\nCrl.MC.No.5643 OF 2020 (&) 5. 202 UKER/TII2\nIn the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. The\nproceedings in C.C.No.17/2020 on the files of the\nJuvenile Justice Board, Kasaragod is quashed.\nSd/-\nV.G.ARUN\nSB/07/01/2021 JUDGE\n\nBee\naS z :\nee\nCrl.MC.No.5643 OF 2020 (ER) .6.. 202UKER/II2\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE Al THE CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FIR IN\nCRIME NO. 121 OF 2016 OF BEKEL\nPOLICE STATION.\nANNEXURE A2 THE CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FINAL\nREPORT AND MEMO OF EVIDENCE IN CRIME\nNO. 121 OF 2016 OF BAKEL POLICE\nSTATION.\nANNEXURE A3 AFFIDAVIT DATED 18.11.2020 SUBMITTED\nBY THE 3RD RESPONDENT.\nANNEXURE A4 AFFIDAVIT DATED 18.11.2020 SUBMITTED\nBY THE ATH RESPONDENT.\nANNEXURE A5 AFFIDAVIT DATED 26.11.2020 SUBMITTED\nBY THE 5TH RESPONDENT.\nANNEXURE A6 AFFIDAVIT DATED 18.11.2020 SUBMITTED\nBY THE 6TH RESPONDENT.\n//true copy// P.A to Judge\n\n"
