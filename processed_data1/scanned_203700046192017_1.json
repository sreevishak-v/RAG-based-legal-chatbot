The above case arose from a private complaint dated\n27/7/2009 filed by the third respondent herein. It was alleged in\nthe private complaint that, the petitioner herein was in love with\nthe defacto complainant, who is the third respondent herein, from\n2003 onwards, and on 16/7/2008 and 20/7/2008, he committed\nrape on the third respondent and thereafter on several occasions,\non a specific assurance to marry her. She became pregnant and\ndelivered a child. Prior to that, she along with her family members\nhad attempted to settle the matter. In pursuance to it, the third\nrespondent gave notice of special marriage under the Special\nMarriage Act. While so, the petitioner allegedly retracted from it.\nThe third respondent gave birth to a female child on 15/3/2009. It\nwas alleged that, the child was born on account of the physical\n\nPeles Fal\n\n2018/KER/704\nCrl.M.C.No.4619/2017 2\nrelationship of petitioner with the third respondent. Even though\ncomplaint was laid to the police, they did not take any action, and\nhence, the private complaint was filed. A copy of the private\ncomplaint was produced as Annexure Al. The above complaint was\nreferred to the police by the Magistrate, invoking section 156(3) of\nCr.P.C.and crime was registered. After investigation, Annexure AQ\nfinal report was filed.\n\n3. The petitioner herein, contending that it is an absolutely\nfalse case and that he is sought to be falsely implicated, has sought\nto quash the entire proceedings. The father of the petitioner herein\nhad purchased an item of property from the family of the third\nrespondent and a house was constructed therein. It was contended\nthat, the petitioner herein was the neighbour of the third\nrespondent, who was leading a loose life. Subsequently, disputes\nrelating to the property arose and O.S.No.205/2009 was filed by\nthe father of the petitioner against the third respondent and her\nfamily members. Annexure A5 is the copy of the above plaint dated\n26/5/2009. It was alleged in the plaint itself that the third\nrespondent herein was leading a loose life .\n\n4. In spite of service of notice of the Crl.M.C.on the third\nrespondent, she had not chosen to contest the proceedings. Heard\nthe learned counsel for the petitioner, learned Public Prosecutor\nand perused the records.\n\n5. It was strenuously contended by the learned counsel for\n\nPeles Fal\n2018/KER/704\n\nCrl.M.C.No.4619/2017 3\nthe petitioner that, the entire facts disclosed that it was an\nabsolutely false case, without any bona fides. It was contended\nthat the complaint was highly belated. Even though it was alleged\nthat, the petitioner committed rape of the third respondent in the\nyear 2008 and that she delivered a baby on 15/3/2009, the\ncomplaint was laid only on 27/7/2009. This delay has not been\nexplained. It was also alleged by her that, even when she was\nseven months' pregnant, she had suspicion that, the petitioner\nherein was trying to avoid her and to retract from the promise for\nmarriage. Hence,it was disclosed to her mother and attempts\nwere allegedly made to enter into a matrimonial relationship, by\nregistering the marriage under the Special Marriage Act. Even\nthough this attempt failed, the complaint was filed much later and\nthe delay has not been explained by the third respondent cogently.\n\n6. Of course, the third respondent has a case that though an\napplication for registering the marriage under the Special\nMarriage Act was filed and notice given, it did not materialse. The\npetitioner herein has an explanation in Annexure A5 that, he was\ntrapped into by signing such document at the instance of others,\nwithout knowing that the notice given was for an intended\nmarriage with the third respondent herein. According to the\npetitioner herein, he never intended to marry the third respondent.\n\n7. The specific allegation in the complaint was that, the\npetitioner herein committed rape of the third respondent on\n\nPeles Fal\n2018/KER/704\n\nCrl.M.C.No.4619/2017 4\n\nspecified dates and consequently, the child was born in the\nphysical relationship with the third respondent. The petitioner had\ndenied the paternity. In the course of the investigation, samples\nwere drawn from the petitioner , child and the third respondent\nherein and sent for conducting DNA test. Annexure A3 is the\nreport dated 15/2/2010 of the DNA test. By the above report, the\npetitioner herein was excluded from the paternity of the child.\nRecords also reveal that, thereafter the third respondent herein\ngave statement that she had physical relationship with one Shiju\nYohanan and the child was born out of that relationship.\nAccordingly, investigating agency conducted DNA test of Shiju\nYohanan and the child. Annexure A4 is the report dated\n15/10/2010 of the DNA test. That report indicates that, Shiju\nYohanan also was excluded from the paternity of the child. The\nrecords also indicate that, thereafter, further statement of the\nthird respondent was recorded in which she stated that she had\nphysical relationship with the petitioner and Shiju Yohannan only.\nHowever, in the light of the exclusion of both the above persons\nfrom the paternity of the child, her version seems to be highly\nunreliable and lacks credibility.\n\n8. The very fact that the third respondent herein made\nallegation of paternity against the petitioner herein and later\nagainst Shiju Yohannan and both of them were excluded from the\npaternity of the child,clearly militates against her case of rape.\n\nPeles Fal\n2018/KER/704\nCrl.M.C.No.4619/2017 5\nThis also shakes at the very root of the case set up by the third\nrespondent and also makes her version weak and has lost its\ncredibility.\n\n9. In the above circumstances, contention of the third\nrespondent that she was subjected to rape by the petitioner herein\nhas to be clearly doubted. Learned counsel for the petitioner\nfurther pointed out that the third respondent, though alleged that\nshe was raped in the year 2008 and a child was born in the year\n2009, she was subjected to the medical examination after the\ncomplaint was laid. Annexure A8 is the medical report. It\nindicates that, there was evidence of recent sexual act. This also\ncast serious doubt on the case set up by the third respondent that\nshe had physical relationship with the petitioner herein some time\nin the year 2008.\n\n10. The entire materials on record clearly shows that, the\nthird respondent has come up with absolutely false case. There are\nreasons to believe that it amounts to abuse of process of the court\nand the forum of legal adjudication cannot be permitted to be\nmisused for such frivolous complaint. Even assuming that the\npetitioner had physical relationship, in the nature of the materials\ncollected by the agency, it can only be deemed to be consensual\nsex. The criminal proceedings cannot be permitted to continue, to\nmeet the ends of justice and hence, it is liable to be quashed\nwithout prejudice to the right of the petitioner herein to seek\n\neet\n2018/KER/704\nCrl.M.C.No.4619/2017 6\nappropriate relief against the third respondent, if he is so advised.\nAccordingly, the Crl.M.C.is allowed. All further proceedings\nin SC No.1518/2015 of the District and Sessions Court, Kollam\narising from Crime No. 458/2009 of Ezhukon Police station stand\nquashed .\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS\nJudge\ndpk\n/true copy/ PS to Judge.\n\n"
