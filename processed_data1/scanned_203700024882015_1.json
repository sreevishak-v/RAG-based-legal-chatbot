No.2488 of 2015\nDated this the 21* day of April, 2015.\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner is the accused in C.C.No.1042 of 2004 on\nthe file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II,\nErnakulam, now pending as L.P.No.6 of 2011. He is the\naccused in Crime No.597 of 2003 of Ernakulam Town North\nPolice Station, registered for the offences punishable under\nSections 294 b (ii), 323, 324, 354 and 457 of the Indian Penal\nCode, on the allegation that the petitioner had committed\ntrespass upon the property of his erstwhile neighbour, one\nRajan and caused hurt to him and others.\n\n2. In this petition, it is stated that the alleged incident\ntook place long back in 2003, while the petitioner was owner in\npossession of 2 cents of land at Pallath Road, Thammanam.\nBut, long back in 2008, the petitioner had sold the said\nproperties near to which the offences are said to have been\ncommitted and moved to South Chittoor, which is about\n\n2015/KER/17260\nCri.M.C. No.2488 of 2015\n-2-\n\n8 k.m., after purchasing the land and properties there. So, he\nhas never been served with any summons or notice in the\ncriminal case pending against him. But on 10.4.2015, a\nwarrant was brought to his house saying it is in a long pending\ncase. According to the petitioner, he is innocent of the\noffences alleged against him and the disputes have been\namicably settled between the petitioner and the de facto\ncomplainant. The petitioner apprehends that since the\noffences alleged include Sections 324, 354 and 284 (b) IPC\nand it is a LP case, if he surrenders before the learned\nMagistrate, he may be remanded to the judicial custody on the\nground that it is a long pending case. Hence the petitioner\nsought for a direction to the court below to dispose of the\napplication for bail on the date of hearing itself.\n\n3. | Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner.\n\n4. The learned counsel for the petitioner urged for a\ndirection on the ground that, since it is a long pending matter,\nthe petitioner may be remanded to jail, pending decision on\n\nBehl\nPete ED\npees\n2015/KER/17260\nCrl.M.C. No.2488 of 2015\n-3-\nthe application.\nI do not think that the Learned Magistrate will remand an\naccused mechanically without application of mind. However,\nto secure the interest of justice, the learned Magistrate is\ndirected to pass orders on the application for bail to be filed by\nthe petitioner, on the date of appearance itself.\nSd/-\nK.
