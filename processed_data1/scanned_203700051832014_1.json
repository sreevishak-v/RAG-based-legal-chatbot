The petitioner is the first accused in Crime\nNo.876/2014. Respondent No.2 has been entrusted with the\ntask of investigation of a case based on Crime No.876/2014. A\ncrime was registered initially, for the offences punishable under\nSections 354, 376(1), 376(2)(e) of the Indian Penal Code. The\nfirst informant was one Smt.Sheeja. The allegations were\nlevelled by her against one Dr.Suresh Ezhuthachan that he has\ncommitted the offences punishable under Sections 354, 376(1),\n376(2)(e) of the Indian Penal Code, against her.\n\n3. Investigation was proceeded with in Crime No.876/2014\nas registered originally by the Thrissur Town East Police Station.\nThe investigating officer had arrived at a finding that the\nallegations levelled by Smt.Sheeja, the defacto complainant in the\n\nae\n\nCrlM.C No. 5183 of 2014 ; 201 IKERIQTO\nFIS, which formed the basis for the registration of the FIR are\nfalse ones. Accordingly, a report as Annexure A2 was filed by\nrespondent No.2 under Section 167 Cr.P.C. before the Judicial\nFirst Class Magistrate Court No.1, Thrissur. The report\nincorporates the revelation of the investigating officer from the\ninvestigation conducted by him that the petitioner and another\naccused have caused the defacto complainant to give a false FIS\nagainst Dr.Suresh Ezhuthachan, R/O.Aswani Hospital, Thrissur,\nbefore respondent No.2 and thereby got the crime in question\nregistered against him. Accordingly, a report was filed before the\nJudicial First Class Court No.1, Thrissur under Section 167 Cr.P.C\nfor removing the offences originally incorporated in Annexure Al\nand to obtain permission to continue investigation by\nincorporating offences punishable under Sections 195, 109 read\nwith Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code (for short IPC) and\n117(d) of the Kerala Police Act, 2011 (for short ‘the Act, 2011‘)\nagainst the petitioner and another accused.\n\n4. Aggrieved by the action of respondent No.2 that the first\naccused has approached this Court in the captioned proceedings\n\nae\nCrlM.C No. 5183 of 2014 201 IKERIQTO\nseeking to quash the same. The allegations raised against the\npetitioner was that he had instigated the defacto complainant to\ngive false evidence with an intention to procure conviction of\nDr.Suresh Ezhuthachan for offences liable to be punished with\nimprisonment for life or imprisonment.\n\n5. Sri.Anoop C.C., the learned counsel, advanced\narguments on behalf of the petitioner. Vide order of this court\ndated 8.12.2017 in Crl.M.A. No.1399/2016, the de_ facto\ncomplainant was brought on record in the proceedings on hand.\n\n6. Sri.S.Manu, the learned counsel, representing the de\nfacto complainant, Smt.Rehna N.S., the learned Public Prosecutor\nrepresenting respondents 1 to 3 were heard elaborately on their\nrival contentions.\n\n7. Sri.Anoop C.C., the learned counsel for the petitioner\nhas submitted that a report under Section 167 Cr.P.C was filed by\nrespondent No.2 proposing to conduct investigation against the\npetitioner as accused No.1 so as to prosecute him for the\ncommission of offences punishable under Sections 195, 109 read\nwith Section 34 IPC and 117(d) of the Act, 2011 without any\n\nae\nCrlM.C No. 5183 of 2014 2017/KERIQO762\n-4:-\nbasis. According to him, the action of respondent No.2 can only\nbe treated as sheer abuse of the authority. The contention\nsecondly advanced by the learned counsel was that a person is\nsaid to give false evidence under Section 191 IPC only when he\nmakes any statement, which is false, which he either knows or\nbelieves to be false or does not believe to be true, when he is\nlegally bound by an oath or by an expressed provision of law to\nstate the truth or being bound by law to make a declaration upon\nany subject. According to the learned counsel, falsity of\nallegations in the first information statement cannot be the basis\nfor launching a prosecution against the petitioner for the offence\nunder Section 191 IPC. The learned counsel placed reliance on\nVittappan__v. State [1987 (2) KLT, 174] to rest the above\ncontention. The contention thirdly advanced was that the\ningredients constituting the offence under Section 109 IPC are\nnot attracted from the allegations. The contention fourthly\nadvanced by the learned counsel was that the offence under\nSection 117 (d) of the Act, 2011, also will not be attracted, in the\nabsence of any allegation having been made by respondent No.2\n\nae\nCrlM.C No. 5183 of 2014 201 IKERIQTO\nthat the petitioner had given any statement before a Police\nOfficer.\n\n8. Raising contentions as above, the learned counsel\ncanvassed for quashing the FIR appended with this proceedings on\nhand as Annexure Al.\n\n9. Sri.S.Manu, the learned counsel appearing for the de\nfacto complainant has submitted that the allegations in Annexure\nAl FIR would satisfactorily meet with the ingredients constituting\nthe offences as described under Sections 195, 109 read with\nSection 34 IPC and 117(d) of the Act, 2011. According to him,\nbased on the First Information Statement of Mrs.Sheeja before\nrespondent No.2 that the Annexure Al crime was originally\nregistered and the investigation was pursued with and when that\nculminated in a finding that the allegations levelled in the FIS are\nfalse ones, a report under Section 167 Cr.P.C was filed before the\ncourt by respondent No.2. It was revealed to respondent No.2\nduring the course of investigation that Smt.Sheeja was made to\nlodge the FIS containing false allegations against Dr.Suresh\nEzhuthachan as instructed by the petitioner herein and the other\n\nBoe\nCrlM.C No. 5183 of 2014 2017/KERIQO762\n-6:-\n\naccused, with a view to procure a false prosecution for grave\noffences liable to be punished with imprisonment for life or\nimprisonment. It was in the said circumstances that respondent\n\nNo.2 proposed to launch a prosecution against the petitioner and\n\nthe other accused for the offences as aforesaid. It is contended\n\nby the learned counsel that circumstances being so, interference\n\nof this Court is absolutely unwarranted in the matter.\n\n10. The learned Public Prosecutor has attacked the\naverments put forth by the learned counsel for the petitioner with\ncontentions similar to those raised by the counsel for the defacto\ncomplainant.\n\n11. In the said backdrop, this Court ventured to see\nwhether the arguments of the petitioner hold merits. As already\nstated, the offences newly incorporated and in respect of which\nthe prosecution is proposed to be launched against the petitioner\nand the co-accused are those punishable under Sections 195,\n109, read with 34 IPC and 117(d) of the Act, 2011.\n\n12. For an offence under Section 195 IPC to be attracted,\nthe person against whom allegations are raised, must have given\n\nae\nCrlM.C No. 5183 of 2014 ; 201 IKERIQTO\nfalse evidence before a court of law. In the case on hand, the FIS\nwas lodged by Smt. Sheeja and that formed the very basis for the\nregistration of crime No.876/2014, which is Annexure Al in the\ncase on hand. As already stated Annexure Al was originally\nregistered for the offences under Sections 354, 376(1), 376(2)(e)\nof the IPC based on the First Information Statement lodged by\nSmt.Sheeja. The respondent No.2 has conducted investigation in\nthe case and it was exposed to him during the course of\ninvestigation that Smt.Sheeja has given a false statement and the\nsame was given at the instigation of two persons, one among\nwhom is the petitioner herein. Accordingly, a report was filed\nbefore the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-l, Thrissur for\nremoving Sections 354, 376(1) and 376(2)(e) IPC. An investigation\nwas also proposed to be conducted with the petitioner as the first\naccused and another person as the second accused against the\ncommission of the offences punishable under Sections 195, 109\nread with Section 34 IPC and 117(d) of the Act, 2011.\nProsecution was not proposed against Smt.Sheeja. lt was\nSmt.Sheeja, who lodged the FIS which subsequently turned to be\n\naa\nris pide\nSaree\nCrl.M.C No. 5183 of 2014 2017/KERID702\n-8:-\na false one. The allegation raised against the petitioners in the\nproposed prosecution for the pursuit of which permission for\ninvestigation under Section 167 Cr.P.C was sought was that the\npetitioner and the co-accused instigated Smt.Sheeja to lodge the\nFIS containing false allegations against Dr.Suresh Ezhuthachan\nliable to procure punishment of imprisonment for life or\nimprisonment for him.\n13. In this connection it is pertinent to note that whether\nthe petitioner had given false evidence or fabricated false\nevidence before a court of law, so as to attract the offence under\nSection 195 IPC against him. Section 195 IPC reads as follows :\n“195. Giving or fabricating false evidence with intent to\nprocure conviction of offence punishable with\nimprisonment for life or imprisonment.- Whoever gives or\nfabricates false evidence intending thereby to cause, or\nknowing it to be likely that he will thereby cause, any person\nto be convicted of an offence which by the law for the time\nbeing in force in India is not capital, but punishable with\nimprisonment for life, or imprisonment for a term of seven\nyears or upwards, shall be punished as a person convicted\nof that offence would be liable to be punished.”\n\nBoe\nCrlM.C No. 5183 of 2014 2017/KERIQO762\n-9:-\n\nSection 195 IPC postulates two ingredients viz., giving false\nevidence and fabricating false evidence. Section 191 provides for\nthe salient features of the offence of giving false evidence and it\ncomprises three essential features as mentioned hereinbelow:\n\n1) legal obligation to state the truth\n\n2) Making of a false statement\n\n3) belief in its falsity.\n\nSection 192 provides for the salient features of fabricating\nfalse evidence and it comprises five essential features as noted\nhereinbelow:\n\ni) There must be causing of any circumstances to exist or\nmaking any false entry in any book or record or making any\ndocument containing a false statement.\n\nii) It must be with the intention that it may appear in\nevidence.\n\nili) Such evidence must be before a judge; arbitrator or public\nservant.\n\niv) That it may cause him to entertain an erroneous opinion.\n\nv) upon any material point.\n\nae\nCrlM.C No. 5183 of 2014 201 IKERIQTO\n~10:-\n\n14. From the allegations incorporated by respondent No.2 in\nhis report filed under Section 167 Cr.P.C, the ingredients of the\noffences alleged are not made out. There is total want of\nallegation either to the effect that the petitioner had given false\nevidence before a court of law or that he had _ instigated\nSmt.Sheeja to give evidence before a court of law. The allegation\nwould not also include that the petitioner had fabricated false\nevidence or instigated Smt.Sheeja to fabricate false evidence and\nadduce the same before a court of law. The allegation would only\ndisclose that the petitioner along with the other accused had\ninstigated Smt.Sheeja to lodge an FIS containing false allegations\nagainst Dr.Suresh Ezhuthachan before respondent No.2, who is\nnone other than a police officer.\n\n14. It has been held by the Apex Court in Shambhu Das @\nBijoy Das & Anr.v. State of Assam [AIR 2010 SC 3300] that an FIR\nunder Section 154 Cr.P.C is not a substantive piece of evidence\nand its use is only to contradict or corroborate with the statement\ngiven by the First Informant himself at a later point of time. In\norder to be qualified to be FIR, there must be something in the\n\naa\nPics are\nSaree\n\nCrLM.C No. 5183 of 2014 2017TRERII762\n\n-:11:-\n\nnature of a complaint or accusation or at least some information\n\nof the crime given with the object of setting the police or criminal\n\nlaw in motion. It must contain some information about the crime\n\ncommitted as also some information about the manner in which\n\nthe cognizable offence has been committed.\n\n15. The Apex Court has also held in Ramprasad v. State\nof Maharastra [AIR 1999 SC 1969] that statement of witnesses\nbefore the investigating officer cannot be used as evidence. It is\nonly that part of the statement, if duly proved, may be used by\nthe accused and with the permission of the Court by the\nprosecution to contradict the witnesses concerned in the manner\nprovided by Section 145 of the Indian Evidence Act.\n\n16. In  Vittappan's case (supra), cited by the learned\ncounsel for the petitioner, a Single Bench of this Court had\noccasion to consider whether a First Information Statement\ncontaining false allegation would form basis for prosecution\nunder Section 191 IPC and held in the negative as follows:\n\n‘It is said that the complaint was thereafter filed on\nthe allegation that either the statements in Ext.P] or\nthose as PWI must be false and therefore the\nappellant must be proceeded against. Ext.P] cannot\nsatisfy the requirements of S.191 of the Indian Penal\n\nail\nBet\nCrLM.C No. 5183 of 2014 2017TRERII762\n-:12:-\n\nCode even if some of the statements contained\n\ntherein are proved to be false to the knowledge or\n\nbelief of the appellant or that he did not believe them\n\nto be true. While giving Ext.P] Pw.1 was not legally\n\nbound by an oath or by an express provision of law to\n\nstate the truth and he was also not bound by law to\n\nmake a declaration upon any subject. It is only an\n\ninformation given under S.154 of the Code regarding\n\ncommission of a cognizable offence intended to set\n\nthe law in motion. Though the maker has to sign the\n\nstatement which is recorded, the Section does not\n\neven say that the statement should be true to the\n\nmaker's knowledge or belief or that it should be given\n\non oath. Even a telephone information regarding\n\ncommission of a cognizable offence by unknown\n\npersons could form first information under S.154. In\n\ncontra-distinction with S.154, the statement given\n\nunder S.161, though not to be signed by the maker,\n\nmust be true because S.161(2) says “shall be bound to\n\nanswer truly” First information statement is only the\n\ninformation on which the concerned police officer has\n\nto start the investigation to find out the truth and\n\ncollect the materials. It can be given no hearsay\n\ninformation also. A wrong first information purposely\n\nmade for initiating action may be of consequence\n\nunder some other provision for example in an action\n\nfor malicious prosecution, but it is not penal under\n\nS.193 on the basis of S.191. Therefore the falsity of\n\nany statement in Ext.P] cannot be the basis of\n\nprosecution. The Sessions Judge was not able to\n\ncome to the conclusion whether the falsity was in\n\nExt.P] or in the evidence given as Pw.!. The basis of\n\nthe conclusion is only the discrepancies between\n\nExt.P] and the evidence as Pw.I. Going by the\n\nreasoning of the Sessions Judge the falsity can be in\n\nExt.P] itself and if so the evidence as Pw.1 can be true\n\nalso. In that event also there is no question of\n\nprosecution under S.193.”\n\n17. In the case on hand, the allegations in the report filed by\n\nrespondent No.2 under Section 167 Cr.P.C are insufficient to\nattract the offence under Section 195 IPC against the petitioner\n\naa\nris pide\nSaree\nCrl.M.C No. 5183 of 2014 2017/KERID702\n-:13:-\nfor the aforesaid reasons. It is not revealed from the report that\nthe petitioner had given any false evidence or fabricated false\nevidence to adduce before a court of law. It is also not revealed\nfrom the allegations that the petitioner along with the other\naccused had instigated the lady to give false evidence or fabricate\nfalse evidence to adduce before a court of law. As already stated,\nby lodging a false FIS, a person cannot be said to have given\nfalse evidence before a court of law or fabricated false evidence\nas contemplated by the provision. Similarly, a person cannot be\nsaid to have instigated another to give false evidence before a\ncourt of law or fabricate evidence even if it turns out later that\nthe former was behind the lodging of the false FIS by the latter.\n18. Before adverting to the sustainability of the offence\nunder Section 109 IPC based on the allegations of respondent No.2\nit is apposite to extract the provision hereunder:\n“109. Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is\ncommitted in consequence and where no express\nprovision is made for its punishment:- Whoever abets any\noffence shall, if the act abetted is committed in\nconsequence of the abetment, and no express provision is\nmade by this Code for the punishment of such abetment,\n\naa\nPics are\npea\nCrl.M.C No. 5183 of 2014 2017/KERID702\n-:14:-\nbe punished with the punishment provided for the offence.\nExplanation-An act or offence is said to be committed\nin consequence of abetment, when it is committed in\nconsequence of the instigation, or in pursuance of the\nconspiracy, or with the aid which constitutes the abetment”.\nTherefore, it is mandatory that for an offence of abetment\nto be attracted, the Act abetted must be committed in\nconsequence of the abetment. When viewed in this backdrop, it\nis relevant to notice that the Act alleged as abetted, i.e., giving\nfalse evidence before a court of law or fabricating false evidence\nto adduce before a court of law under Section 195 IPC, was not\nallegedly committed. Even if, it is taken for granted that\nSmt.Sheeja was compelled to give the First Information Statement\ncontaining false allegations against Dr.Suresh Ezhuthachan on\nthe instigation of the petitioner and another, that would not be\nsufficient to attract the offence under Section 195 IPC for the\nreason that the statement lodged by her as FIS is not evidence\nand it was not tendered before a court of law.\n19. Yet another ingredient to attract the offence of giving\nfalse evidence was that the person making it would be legally\n\nCrlM.C No. 5183 of 2014 2017/KERIQO762\n-:15:-\n\nbound to make the same. Therefore, if the person making it\ndoes not have any legal obligation to give the truth in evidence,\nhe cannot be made liable for a prosecution for giving false\nevidence. In the case on hand, the petitioner as well as the other\naccused were not under any legal obligation to tender any\nevidence nor to abstain from adducing any evidence. Smt.Sheeja,\nwho according to the prosecution, was the person allegedly given\nthe false FIS, was also not under any legal obligation as\ncontemplated by Section 195 IPC while lodging the FIS. In the\naforesaid circumstances the petitioner is not liable to be\nprosecuted for the alleged action of instigating Smt.Sheeja to give\nfalse evidence under Section 109 r/w Section 195 IPC. The action\nof respondent No.2 proposing to conduct investigation against\nthe petitioner for the offences under Section 109 r/w Section 195\nIPC so as to prosecute him would not legally sustain.\n\n20. The further aspect to be looked into is the\nattractability of the offence under Section 117(d) of the Act, 2011\nbased on_ the allegations set forth in the report filed by\nrespondent No.2 under Section 167 Cr.P.C. It is relevant to have\n\naa\ncity\nSaree\nCrl.M.C No. 5183 of 2014 2017/KERID702\n-:16:-\nthe provision extracted hereunder for convenient reference.\n“117. XXXXXXXXXX\n(a) XXXXXXXX\n(b) XXXXXXXX\n(C)XXXXXXX\n(d) deliberately makes a false statement to a Police\nOfficer with intent to mislead the police in material\nparticulars in a_ police investigation or due\nperformance of police duty; or\n(@) XXXXXXX\"\n\n21. When viewed in the backdrop of the allegations set\nforth in the report of respondent No.2, there is nothing to\ndisclose that a false statement has been given by the petitioner\ndeliberately to a police officer with intend to mislead the police in\nmaterial particulars relating to a police investigation or due\nperformance of police duty. Therefore, there is nothing in the\nreport filed by respondent No.2 liable to attract an offence under\nSection 117(d) of the Act, 2011.\n\n22. In view of the discussion as aforesaid, there is force in\nthe contentions raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner.\n\nThe report of respondent No.2 proposing further investigation\nagainst the petitioners for the offences punishable under Section\n195, 109 r/w Section 34 IPC and Section 117(d) of the Act, 2011\n\nae\nCrlM.C No. 5183 of 2014 201 IKERIQTO\n-17:-\n\nnewly incorporated into Annexure Al is not liable to be pursued\n\nwith. The offences in respect of which further investigation is\n\nsought to be conducted by respondent No.2 against the\npetitioner will not sustain for the foregoing reasons and the\n\nreliefs sought for by the petitioner in the case on hand, is not\n\nliable to be granted.\n\n23. Respondent No.2 is highly unjustified in proposing\ninvestigation against the petitioner for the commission of the\noffences as aforesaid to launch a prosecution.
