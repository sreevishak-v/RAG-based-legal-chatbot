RAMESH CHAND, P.P\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION\nON 07.01.2020, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE\nFOLLOWING:\n\n2020/KER/502\nCrl.MC.No.8272 OF 2019(D)\n2\nORDER\nDated this the 7th day of January 2020\n\nThe petitioners have been directed to show\ncause why they should not execute a bond under\nSection 107 of the Cr.P.C as per impugned order\nat Annexure-I.\n\n2. The order indicates that, on a report\nfiled by the Sub Inspector of Police consequent\nto registering an FIR as Crime No.232/19 under\nSection 107 of the Cr.P.C, the Sub Divisional\nMagistrate was convinced that the petitioners\nare liable to answer for breach of peace\nbecause earlier, another Crime No.79/2019 has\nbeen registered against them. Accordingly the\nimpugned order was issued. It is pertinent to\nnote that even though Annexure Al indicate that\nit was a preliminary order it is not an order\nunder Section 111. Even though, towards the end\nof the order, the Sub Divisional Magistrate\n\n2020/KER/502\nCrl.MC.No.8272 OF 2019(D)\n3\n\nstates that the petitioners shall show cause\nwhy they should not be ordered under Section\n107 of the Cr.P.C r/w Section 111 of the said\ncode to execute a bond for Rs.25,000/- with two\nsolvent sureties for a like amount to keep\npeace for a period of one year, no. such\ncombined order can be passed by the Sub\nDivisional Magistrate as it is held by this\nCourt in Santhosh v. State of Kerala, 2014 (3)\nKLT 837 and also subsequent decision in\nSajeesh.K v. State of Kerala, 2014 SCC Online\nKer.27899. By initiating proceedings under\nSection 107 of the Cr.P.C, the Magistrate must\npass an order under Section 111 of the Cr.P.C,\nstating the nature of information proceedings\nand the relevant factors which influence the\nmind in Magistrate to form an opinion that the\npetitioners are likely to cause imminent breach\nof peace or public tranquility in a particular\n\n2020/KER/502\nCrl.MC.No.8272 OF 2019(D)\n4\ncase and the probable period during which it is\nlikely to disturb the peace of tranquility ina\nparticular locality, and in order to prevent\nthe same it is necessary to take preventive\nactions against them.\n\n3. In the instant case apart from the FIR\nwhich was registered by the Sub Inspector which\nitself appears to be not proper because Section\n107 of the Cr.P.C is not a cognizable offence\nfor which an FIR can be registered. It should\nactually has been a report filed by the Sub\nInspector of Police requesting action to be\ntaken under Section 107 of the Cr.P.C.\n\n4. In view of the settled position that\nproceedings under Section 111 has to be\ninitiated prior to making an order under\nSection 107 and therefore, the entire\nproceedings in Annexure-I as M.C No.217/2019,\n\nReal\nElz ro a\n2020/KER/502\nCrl.MC.No.8272 OF 2019(D)\n5\n\nagainst the petitioners shall stands quashed.\n\nHowever, it is made clear that there is no\nembargo in the Sub Divisional Magistrate\nproceeding afresh on a report properly received\nin accordance with law.\n\nSd/-\nASHOK MENON\nJUDGE\n\nSPK\n\nBE] es eel\npas ieee\nBE\n2020/KER/502\nCr1.MC.No.8272 OF 2019(D)\n6\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE I COPY OF THE ORDER DATED 10.06.2019 IN\nMC NO.217/2019 OF SUB DIVISIONAL\nMAGISTRATE, THRISSUR\nRESPONDENT'S/S EXHIBITS: NIL\n//TRUE COPY//\nPA TO JUDGE\n\n"
