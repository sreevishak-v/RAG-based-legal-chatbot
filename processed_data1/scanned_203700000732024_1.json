Prosecution case is that petitioner herein, along with other\naccused, had availed a loan from the 3 respondent Company\npursuant to a conspiracy to cause unlawful loss to the complainant\nand unlawful gain to the accused, cheated the complainant of a\nlarge amount of money, and thereby committed the offences\nalleged.\n\n3. Sri.M.Sasindran, the learned counsel for the petitioner, submitted\nthat there is absolutely no allegation against the petitioner so as to\nrope him as an accused. However, for reasons unknown to the\npetitioner, he has been falsely implicated as an accused in the\ncrime.\n\nBURA Tal\neomaae eee\noer\n2024/KER/631\nCRL.MC NO. 73 OF 2024\n3\n\n4. Having heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the\nlearned Public Prosecutor, I am of the view that the FIR in Crime\nNo.1371/2023 was registered only on 02.11.2023 and_ the\ninvestigation is continuing. At this stage, it is not proper for this\nCourt to interdict the investigation. Time and again, the courts\nhave held that recourse to Section 482 to quash the FIR must be\nresorted to only in exceptional circumstances.\n\n5. In the decision in State of Haryana and others v. Bhajan Lal and\nothers (1992) Suppl 1 SCC 335, and Shambhu Kharwar v. State of\nUttar Pradesh AIR 2022 SC 3901, the Supreme Court has held that\nthe courts cannot enter into the merits of the allegations or trench\nupon the power of the investigating agency to investigate into\nallegations.\n\nIn view of the above, I find no merit in this Crl.M.C., and the\nsame is dismissed.\nsd/-\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\nAMV/05/01/2024\n\nDera\npec Ered nie\nee\nEee\n2024/KER/631\nCRL.MC NO. 73 OF 2024\n4\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 73/2024\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES\nANNEXURE ATI A TRUE COPY OF THE FIR IN’ CRIME\nNO.1371/2023 OF PAYYANNUR POLICE STATION,\nKANNUR DISTRICT\nANNEXURE AIT A TRUE COPY OF THE APPLICATION FORM\nSUBMITTED BY THE PETITIONER TO THE 3RD\nRESPONDENT BANK (NO.MUALC98980)\nANNEXURE AIII A TRUE COPY OF THE STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT\nOF THE PETITIONER IN THE HDFC BANK, FOR\nTHE PERIOD FROM 01.05.2023 TO 31.10.2023\nANNEXURE AIV A TRUE COPY OF THE COMPLAINT DATED\n13-11-2023 FILED BY THE PETITIONER WITH\nTHE SUB INSPECTOR OF POLICE CHANDERA\nANNEXURE AV A TRUE COPY OF THE’ RECEIPT DATED\n13-11-2023 ISSUED BY THE S.H.0.CHANDERA\nACKNOWLEDGING THE ANNEXURE AIV COMPLAINT\nANNEXURE AVI A TRUE COPY OF THE APPLICATION SUBMITTED\nBY THE PETITIONER FOR VISA FOR LONG STAY\nIN BELGIUM\nTRUE COPY\n\n"
