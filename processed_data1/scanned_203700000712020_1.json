Subsequently, the petitioners had approached this Court\nfor quashing of the proceedings and vide order at Annexure â€” A5, it\nwas directed by this Court that the investigation could continue.\nBut the final report has to be filed after seeking permission of this\nCourt.\n\n3. Subsequently, the petitioners had approached the\nSessions Court for modification of the direction regarding the\nappearance before the Investigating Officer on every Saturday.\nThe order was modified to the effect that they shall appear before\nthe Investigating Officer on every second Saturday. That order at\nAnnexure A-6 is challenged before this Court.\n\nPape\nies a\nCrl.MC.No.71 OF 2020 (H) 2020/KER/OS7\n3\nConsidering the facts that the final report has to be filed\nonly after getting permission of this Court, I find that the direction\nto appear before the Investigating Officer on every second\nSaturday is not very relevant and necessary. The petitioners shall\nappear before the Investigating Officer as and when called for.\nThe impugned order is modified to that effect.\nThe Crl.M.C is disposed of as above.\nSd/-\nASHOK MENON\nJUDGE\nNR/16/01/20\n\nee al\nCrl.MC.No.71 OF 2020 (H) 2020/KERI657\n4\nAPPENDIX\n\nPETITIONERS' EXHIBITS:\n\nANNEXURE Al THE COPY OF THE FIR NO.1229/2019 oF\nMARADU POLICE STATION.\n\nANNEXURE A2 THE COPY OF THE PRIVATE COMPLAINT LODGED\nBY THE 2ND RESPONDENT BEFORE THE JUDICIAL\nMAGISTRATE COURT-VIII, ERNAKULAM.\n\nANNEXURE A3 THE COPY OF THE SALE AGREEMENT EXECUTED\nBETWEEN THE PETITIONERS AND 2ND\nRESPONDENT, DATED 03.07.2017.\n\nANNEXURE A4 THE COPY OF THE ORDER OF THE HON'BLE\nSESSIONS COURT, ERNAKULAM IN\nCRL.M.C.NO.2229/2019 DATED 24.10.2019.\n\nANNEXURE A5 THE COPY OF THE ORDER OF THIS HON'BLE\nCOURT IN CRL.M.C.NO.8440/2019 DATED\n03.12.2019.\n\nANNEXURE A6 THE COPY OF THE ORDER OF THE HON'BLE\nSESSIONS COURT, ERNAKULAM IN\nCRL.M.P.NO.3048/2019 IN\nCRL.M.C.NO.2229/2019, DATED 16.12.2019.\n\nRESPONDENTS' EXHIBITS: NIL\n\n//TRUE COPY// PA TO JUDGE\n\n"
