M.C No. 6269 of 2013\nDated this the 01* day of January, 2014.\nORDER\n\nPetitioners are the accused Nos. 1 to 3 in O.R No.\n7/99 of Nelliampathy Forest Range. The offences alleged are\npunishable under Sections 27(1)(e)(iii) and (iv) of Kerala\nForest Act. The Crl.M.C is filed seeking to quash Annexure-A\ncharge sheet and all proceedings in C.C No. 60/10 on the file\n\nof the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Alathur.\n2. There are 12 accused in the crime. Accused Nos.\n10 to 12 were acquitted by the Judicial First Class Magistrate\nCourt, Alathur vide judgment dated 30.03.2007 in C.C No.\n742/01. Subsequently, the accused Nos. 5, 7 and 8 faced the\ntrial and were acquitted in C.C.No.191/07 on the file of the\nsame court. It is submitted that out of the remaining accused,\ntwo of them are no more and one is in abroad. The learned\nMagistrate decided the case on merits vide Annexure-B and C\njudgments. The learned Magistrate observes that he is unable\nto accept the version of complainant that P7 statement was\ngiven by Ali voluntarily and in the manner deposed by him\nand complainant's witnesses. It is stated that there is no\nevidence to prove the alleged commission of tresspass into the\nforest area and removal of Rose wood timber by accused Nos.\n\n2014/KER/60\n\nCrl. M.C No. 6269 of 2013 3\n\n10 to 12. The statement of accused No.10 which inculpates\nthe accused was not admitted in evidence. For these reasons,\nthe court found that A10 to 12 are not guilty of the offences\ncharged against them. In Annexure-B judgment, the court\nobserves that the accused except 10 to 12 are implicated as\nper confession of accused No.10. The learned Magistrate\nfound that the confession is not admissible in evidence. For\nthe same reason, the learned Magistrate in Annexure-C\njudgment found that there no other source to proceed against\naccused Nos. 5,7 and 8 and that confession of accused No.10\nis not binding on accused Nos. 5, 7 and 8. In the light of\nAnnexure-B and C judgment, the offences alleged against the\npetitioners are liable to be quashed. Since the other accused\nwere acquitted, for the very same set of reasons, this Court is\nof the view that no purpose would be served by continuing the\nprosecution against the petitioner.\n\nAccordingly, Crl.M.C is disposed of quashing\nAnnexure-A charge sheet and all proceedings in C.C No. 60/10\non the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court,\nAlathur.\n\nHARUN-UL-RASHID, JUDGE.\nIsn\n\n"
