HARILAL, J.\nORDER\n\nThese Criminal Miscellaneous Cases arose from\nan order passed in C.M.P.No.518/15 in Crime No.16/13\nof Town Police Station (CB CID.Cr.No.23/ 2013), on the\nfiles of the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court, Kozhikode.\nCri.M.C. No.1887 of 2015 is filed by the applicant in the\nabove C.M.P. and Crl.M.C.No.2250 of 2015 is filed by\nthe State of Kerala, represented by the respondent\ntherein. The parties are referred to as in the impugned\norder. The applicant, a Private Limited Company, along\nwith its Directors, are the accused in the above crime\nregistered and investigated by C.B.C.I.D. EOW Il,\nMalappuram, alleging commission of the offences\npunishable under Section 4, 5 and 6 of the Prize, Chits\n\n2015/KER/17251\n\nCrl.M.C. Nos.1887 & 2250 of 2015 “2:\n\nand Money Circulation (Banning) Act, 1978 (for short\n‘the Act'). During the course of investigation, the\nwarehouse, wherein the merchandise with connected\nbusiness literature were stored, of the accused\ncompany was sealed and the key had been produced\nbefore the court below. The merchandise now stored\nin the warehouse is approximately valued to\nRs.1,11,59,140/-. The applicant had approached this\nCourt by filing W.P.(C) No.3126 of 2015 seeking the\npermission to carry on business and also for interim\ncustody of the articles involved. As regards interim\ncustody of the articles, this Court directed the\napplicant to move the court below, invoking\njurisdiction under Sec.451 of the Cr.P.C. and as\nregards the other relief, the petitioner was permitted\nto carry on the business. In compliance with the said\ndirection, the petitioner filed the above C.M.P. under\nSec.451 of the Cr.P.C. seeking interim custody of the\narticles.\n\nErr eee)\ni calls co]\n2015/KER/17251\nCrl.M.C. Nos.1887 & 2250 of 2015 “3:\n\n2. The respondent filed objection contending that\nthe merchandise kept in the warehouse are proceeds\nof the crime and they cannot be released and if the\nsame are released to the applicant, they will continue\nthe business in violation of the provisions in the said\nAct.\n\n3. After considering the rival contentions, the\ncourt below allowed the application on conditions,\nwhich are given below:\n\n(1) The applicant shall execute\nsecurity bond, with 2. solvent\nsureties, for Rs.1.25 crores in favour\nof this Court and shall produce title\ndeed relating to immovable\nproperty of the applicant or sureties\nworth that amount, which fact shall\nbe supported with a certificate\nissued by the revenue authority,\noffering the property as security for\nrelease of the merchandise and\ncommercial literature kept in the\nwarehouse, till an order u/s 452\n\nErr eee)\nTs ee\n2015/KER/17251\nCrl.M.C. Nos.1887 & 2250 of 2015 4:\n\nCr.P.C. is passed in respect of those\n\nitems or till the disposal of the\n\nmain case.\n\n(2) The title deed shall not be\n\nreleased until disposal of main case\n\nand if it is found that the items\n\nreleased as per this petition are\n\nliable for confiscation then the value\n\nof the same of the same i.e,\n\nRs.1,11,59,140/- shall be realised by\n\nproceeding against the immovable\n\nproperty offered as security.”\n\n4, The legality and propriety of the order granting\ninterim custody of the articles, on conditions, to the\napplicant is under challenge in Crl.M.C.No.2250 of\n2015 filed by the State. Crl.M.C.No.1887 of 2015 is\nfiled by the applicant on the ground that the\nconditions imposed to grant interim custody are\nillegal, irrational and improper.\n\n5. The main ground projected in Crl.M.C.No.1887\nof 2015 is that the products/merchandise which are\nkept in the warehouse are not the Material Objects or\n\n2015/KER/17251\n\nCrl.M.C. Nos.1887 & 2250 of 2015 -5:-\nthe articles seized in the proceedings which are\npending before the court below. When the business\npremises was locked and taken into custody by the\nauthorities, the products/merchandise also came into\nthe custody of the respondent and subsequently by\nproducing the key of the warehouse before the court,\nthe articles which are kept in the warehouse came\ninto the custody of the court. The merchandise now\nstored in the warehouse and_- valued_ to\nRs.1,11,59,140/- are not included in the seizure\nmahazar also. So, it cannot be treated as seized\narticles or material objects. The court below, without\nconsidering the fact that the properties which are\nkept in the warehouse are not the articles seized by\nthe police, imposed stringent conditions for releasing\nthe said articles.\n\n6. The main ground in Cri.M.C.No.2250 of 2015 is\nthat the court below failed to consider the fact that\nthe goods have been procured from the proceeds of\n\n2015/KER/17251\nCrl.M.C. Nos.1887 & 2250 of 2015 -6:-\nthe illegal money circulation activities and they cannot\nbe considered as_ products, which had been procured\nin the course of a legal business; and thereby the\narticles are not liable to be given to the applicant, in\ninterim custody.\n\n7. | have heard Sri. George Poonthottam, the\nlearned counsel for the petitioner and Sri. K.I. Abdul\nRasheed, the learned Additional Director General of\nProsecutions.\n\n8. The learned counsel for the petitioner drew\nmy attention to Ext.R1(2) seizure mahazar produced\nby the applicant in Crl.M.C.No.2250 of 2015 and\nsubmits that the articles seized by the police are\nspecifically mentioned in the seizure mahazar and the\npolice can insist the custody of the said articles only.\nThe articles, which are kept in the warehouse do not\nfind a place in the seizure mahazar. Thus, the articles\nwhich are kept in the warehouse are not taken into\ncustody so far; but they are unable to continue the\n\n2015/KER/17251\nCrl.M.C. Nos.1887 & 2250 of 2015 - 7\nbusiness on the reason that the said warehouse is\nlocked by the police and the key was produced before\nthe court below.\n\n9. The learned Additional Director General of\nProsecutions submits that if the petitioner is allowed\nto carry on the business, he will continue the business\nin violation of the provisions of the Act. The learned\nAdditional Director General of Prosecutions further\nadmitted that there is no material in the possession of\npolice to show the description of the articles which are\nkept in the warehouse, which now stands locked by\nthe police. It is also admitted that these articles are\nnot Material Objects, in the case.\n\n10. | have given my anxious consideration to the\nrival submissions made at the Bar.\n\n11. The questions to be considered are, can the\ncourt below be justified in granting interim custody of\nthe articles which are kept in the warehouse to the\napplicant in view of the jurisdiction and power under\n\n2015/KER/17251\nCrl.M.C. Nos.1887 & 2250 of 2015 -8:-\nSec.451 of the Cr.P.C.? Are the conditions imposed\nreasonable, proper and justifiable?\n\n12. Prima facie, | find that this Court allowed the\napplicant to carry on business and directed to\napproach the trial court to get interim custody of the\narticles which are kept in the warehouse, by\nAnnexure-A2 order in Crl.M.C.No.1887 of 2015, passed\nby this Court in W.P.(C) No.3126 of 2015 and this\norder has not been challenged by the State of Kerala\nso far. So, indisputably, the applicant has given right\nto carry on the business.\n\n13. The learned counsel for the petitioner cited a\ndecision reported in Sunderbhai Ambalal Desai v.\nState of Gujarat [(2002) 10 SCC 283] and drew my\nattention to the guidelines given by the Apex Court in\nthe above decision for releasing the seized articles\nunder interim custody. Going by the decision, it is\nseen that the Apex Court has severely criticised the\npractice of keeping articles indefinitely under the\n\n2015/KER/17251\n\nCrl.M.C. Nos.1887 & 2250 of 2015 -9:-\ncustody of court, awaiting trial and laid down clear\nguidelines to release the articles under interim\ncustody or to sell or dispose the articles, if the articles\nare subject to speedy and natural decay. The learned\nAdditional Director General of Prosecutions miserably\nfailed to convince the court as regards the purpose for\nwhich the police insisted for the custody of the\narticles worth more than Rs.1 crore, when the said\narticles had not been seized by the police and no\ndocument has been prepared or produced before the\ntrial court or this Court to show the description of the\narticles, which are kept in the warehouse. Ext.R1(1)\nseizure mahazar in Crl.M.C.No.2250 of 2015 shows\nthat a_ few articles alone had been seized by the\npolice. The remaining articles happened to be in the\ncustody of court, on the reason that the articles are\nkept in the warehouse and key is in the custody of the\ncourt.\n\n14. Going by the Act, | find that there is no\n\nErr eee)\nTs ee\n2015/KER/17251\nCrl.M.C. Nos.1887 & 2250 of 2015 -10:-\nprovision for confiscation of the articles used for the\ncommission of the offences or seized from the\npremises, where the offence was committed. So, the\narticles can be used as evidence to prove the alleged\noffence against the accused only. If that be so, | am of\nthe opinion that no purpose will be served by keeping\nthe said articles in the custody of the court, if\nsufficient precaution or alternative measures can be\ntaken to prevent the evidence being lost, altered or\ndestroyed as provided in the decision in Sunderbhai\nAmbalal Desai v. State of Gujarat [2002 (10) SCC 283].\nThe relevant paragraphs of the above decision are extracted\nbelow:\n“5. S. 451 clearly empowers the\nCourt to pass appropriate orders with\nregard to such property, such as-\n(1) for the proper custody\npending conclusion of the inquiry or trial;\n(2) to order it to be sold or\notherwise disposed of, after recording\n\n2015/KER/17251\nCrl.M.C. Nos.1887 & 2250 0f 2015 -: 11 :-\nsuch evidence as it thinks necessary;\n\n(3) if the property is subject to\nspeedy and natural decay, to dispose of\nthe same.\n\n6. It is submitted that despite wide\npowers, proper orders are not passed by\nthe Courts. It is also pointed out that in\nthe State of Gujarat there is Gujarat\nPolice Manual for disposal and custody\nof such articles. As per the Manual also,\nvarious circulars are issued for\nmaintenance of proper registers for\nkeeping the muddamal articles in safe\ncustody.\n\n7. In our view, the powers under\nS.451, CrPC. should be exercised\nexpeditiously and judiciously. It would\nserve various purposes, namely:-\n\n1. Owner of the article would\nnot suffer because of its remaining unused\nor by its misappropriation;\n\n2. Court or the police would not\nbe required to keep the article in safe\ncustody;\n\n2015/KER/17251\nCrl.M.C. Nos.1887 & 2250 0f 2015 -: 12: :-\n\n3. If the proper panchnama before\nhanding over possession of article is\nprepared, that can be used in evidence\ninstead of its production before the Court\nduring the trial. If necessary, evidence\ncould also be recorded describing the\nnature of the property in detail; and\n\n4. This jurisdiction of the Court to\nrecord evidence should be exercised\npromptly so that there may not be further\nchance of tampering with the articles.\n\n8. The question of proper custody\nof the seized article is raised in number of\nmatters. In Smt. Basavva Kom\nDyamangouda Patil v. State of Mysore\nand Another, (1977 (4) SCC 358), this\nCourt dealt with a case where the seized\narticles were not available for being\nreturned to the complainant. In that case,\nthe recovered ornaments were kept in a\ntrunk in the police station and later it was\nfound missing, the question was with\nregard to payment of those articles. In that\ncontext, the Court observed as under:-\n\n2015/KER/17251\nCrl.M.C. Nos.1887 & 2250 of 2015 -: 13 :-\n\n“4. The object and scheme of\nthe various provisions of the Code\nappear to be that where the property\nwhich has been the subject matter of\nan offence is seized by the police, it\nought not to be retained in the\ncustody of the Court or of the police\nfor any time longer than what is\nabsolutely necessary. As the seizure\nof the property by the police\namounts to a clear entrustment of\nthe property to a Government\nservant, the idea is that the property\nshould be restored to the original\nowner after the necessity to retain it\nceases. It is manifest that there may\nbe two stages when the property\nmay be returned to the owner. In the\nfirst place it may be returned during\nany inquiry or trial. This may\nparticularly be necessary where the\nproperty concerned is sought to\nspeedy or natural decay. It may be\nother compelling reasons also which\n\n2015/KER/17251\nCrl.M.C. Nos.1887 & 2250 of 2015 -:: 14:\nmay justify the disposal of the\nproperty to the owner or otherwise\nin the interest of justice. The High\nCourt and the Sessions Judge\nproceeded on the footing that one of\nthe essential requirements of the\nCode is that the articles concerned\nmust be produced before the Court\nor should be in its custody. The\nobject of the Code seems to be that\nany property which is in the control\nof the Court either directly or\nindirectly should be disposed of by\nthe Court and a just and proper\norder should be passed by the Court\nregarding its disposal. In a criminal\ncase, the police always acts under\nthe direct control of the Court and\nhas to take orders from it at every\nstage of an inquiry or trial. In this\nbroad sense, therefore, the Court\nexercises an overall control on the\nactions of the Police Officers in\nevery case where it has taken\n\nErr eee)\ni calls co]\n2015/KER/17251\nCrl.M.C. Nos.1887 & 2250 of 2015 15:\ncognizance”. (emphasis supplied)\n12. For this purpose, if material on\nrecord indicates that such articles belong\nto the complainant at whose house theft,\nrobbery or dacoity has taken place, then\nseized articles be handed over to the\ncomplainant after:-\n(1) preparing detailed proper\npanchnama of such articles;\n(2) taking photographs of such\narticles and a bond that such articles\nwould be produced if required at the time\nof trial; and\n(3) after taking proper security”.\n\n15. It is significant that here the articles are\nsubject to speedy and natural decay. In the light of\nthe above decision, | am also of the opinion that the\narticles, except the articles which are specifically\nmentioned in the seizure mahazar, can be released to\nthe petitioner after preparing a detailed and proper\nPanchanama of the articles and obtaining security\nbond, particularly, when the articles are neither\n\n2015/KER/17251\nCrl.M.C. Nos.1887 & 2250 of 2015 -- 16 :-\nMaterial Objects nor seized articles in the prosecution\nproceedings against the applicant.\n\n16. In the above view of the matter, | find that\nthere is no illegality or impropriety in the findings\nwhereby the court below granted interim custody of\nthe articles to the applicant.\n\n17. Coming to the reasonableness of conditions\nimposed for releasing the articles, | have already held\nthat the production of the articles may be required as\nevidence only to prove the offence against the\napplicant and no purpose would be served by keeping\nthe articles in the custody of the court, in the absence\nof the provisions to confiscate the articles allegedly\nused for commission of the offence or found in the\npremises where the offence was committed. In that\nview of the matter, | find that the conditions imposed\nby the court below are excessive, unreasonable and\ndisproportionate with the purpose for which the said\narticles are required. Therefore, in supersession of the\n\n2015/KER/17251\nCrl.M.C. Nos.1887 & 2250 of 2015 -17:-\nconditions imposed by the court below, the articles\nshall be released to the applicant on compliance of the\nfollowing conditions:\n\n(i) The person who receives the\nkey shall produce proper authorization\ngiven by the company to take\npossession of the articles from the\ncustody of the court.\n\n(11) The court below shall prepare\na detailed and proper panchanama\nincluding value, of the articles which\nare kept im the warehouse. The\npreparation of the panchanama will be\nat the expense of the applicant and the\napplicant shall facilitate all the\nrequirements for the same to the\nsatisfaction of the court below, in\naccordance with the interim orders to\nbe passed by the court below.\n\n(111) The photograph of the entire\n\n2015/KER/17251\nCrl.M.C. Nos.1887 & 2250 of 2015 -- 18 :-\narticles shall be taken and the same\nshall be kept with negatives as part of\nprosecution records.\n\n(iv) The applicant shall not\nconduct any business activity using the\nsaid articles or any other articles in\nviolation of any of the provisions in the\nPrize, Chits and Money Circulation\n(Banning) Act, 1978.\n\n(v) The applicant shall execute a\nsecurity bond for an amount equal to\nthe value of the entire articles, with two\nsolvent sureties each for the like sum,\nfor the realisation of the said amount\nfrom their immovable properties, if the\ncourt finds that the value of the articles\nis realisable from the accused, to the\nsatisfaction of the Chief Judicial\nMagistrate's Court, Kozhikode.\n\n(vi) The court below shall release\n\n2015/KER/17251\nCrl.M.C. Nos.1887 & 2250 of 2015 -: 19 :-\n\nthe key of the warehouse to the\napplicant on satisfactory compliance of\nthe above conditions, within a period of\none month from the date of receipt of a\ncopy of this order and the release of\nthe key shall be deemed to be release of\nall items kept in the warehouse while\nsealing the same by the Investigating\nOfficer.\n\n(vii) The court below is at liberty\nto pass necessary interim orders for the\neffective and proper execution of the\nabove conditions.\n\nCril.M.C.No.1887 of 2015 will stand allowed to the\nabove extent and Crl.M.C.No.2250 of 2015 will stand\ndismissed.\n\nSd/-\n(K.
