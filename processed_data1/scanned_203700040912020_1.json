CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n06.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\n|\nOa\nCrl.MC.No.4091 OF 2020 (B) Be. 202 1IKERITS4\nORDER\nDated this the 6th day of January 2021\nPetitioners are the accused in Crime No.574-\n2008 registered at the Edachery Police Station for\noffences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148,\n341, 323, 324 and 308 r/w 149 of IPC, now pending as\nS.C.No0.842/2018 on the files of the Assistant Sessions\nCourt, Vadakara. As per Annexure-2 judgment, all\naccused except the petitioners were acquitted. The\ncase against the petitioners was split up and refiled\nas S.C.No.842/2018. The de facto complainant, at\nwhose instance the crime was registered, is arrayed\nas the 2â„¢ respondent. Annexure-3 affidavit has been\nfiled by 2\"? respondent stating that the reason for the\nincident, which led to registration of the crime, has\nbeen resolved amicably, in view of the settlement and\n\n|\nBee\nCrl1.MC.No.4091 OF 2020(B) AL, 202UKERI7S4\nhe has no subsisting grievance against the petitioner.\n\n2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also, who,\non instructions, submits that the petitioner has no\ncriminal antecedents.\n\n3. Having considered the gravity of the offences\nalleged, nature of the injury caused and having\nperused the affidavit filed by the 2\" respondent, the\ncontents of which are submitted to be true and\nvoluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled and\nno public interest is involved in this matter. The fact\nthat the accused Nos. 2 to 6 were acquitted after trial\nas evident by Annexure-2 judgment and the further\nfact that the dispute has been dissolved between the\nparties is also taken into consideration. Moreover, in\nview of the settlement, possibility of the criminal\nproceedings ending in conviction is remote. As such,\ncontinuance of the proceedings will amount to an\n\ni\ncone\nOa\nCrl1.MC.No.4091 OF 2020(B) Be. 202UKERI7S4\nabuse of process of court and hence, in view of the\nlegal position set out by the Honourable Supreme\nCourt in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab\n[(2008) 4 SCC 582] and Gian Singh v. State of\nPunjab and another [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is\nno impediment in granting the relief sought.\nIn the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. The\nproceedings in S.C.No.842/2018 on the files of the\nAssistant Sessions Court, Vadakara is quashed.\nSd/-\nV.G.ARUN\nSB/06/01/2020 JUDGE\n\nae\nReo\nfs\nee\nBle 4 Te\nCr1.MC.No.4091 OF 2020(B) .6.. 2021/KER/754\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE-1 THE CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FINAL\nREPORT IN CRIME NO. 574/2008 OF\nEDACHERY POLICE STATION.\nANNEXURE-2 THE CERTIFIED COPY OF JUDGMENT IN\nS.C.447/2009 ON TH FILE OF ASSISTANT\nSESSIONS JUDGE VATAKARA\nDT.20.08.2015.\nANNEXURE-3 SWORN AFFIDAVIT OF 2ND RESPONDENT\n14.09.2020.\n//true copy// P.A to Judge\n\n"
