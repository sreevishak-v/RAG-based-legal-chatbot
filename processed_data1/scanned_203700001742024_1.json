NOUSHAD K.A. (PP)\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n10.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nCRL.MC NO. 174 OF 2024 EPL\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.\n~ Cri.M.C. No.174 of 2024\nDated this the 10\" day of January, 2024\nORDER\n\nPetitioner challenges Annexure-Al order issued by the\nJudicial First Class Magjistrate-ll, Pathanamthitta directing\ntransfer of S.T. No.2061 of 2019 to the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate-IIl, Pathanamthitta, pursuant to the order of the Chief\nJudicial Magistrate, Pathanamthitta withdrawing the case and\nmaking it over to the Judicial First Class Magjistrate-lll,\nPathanamthitta.\n\n2. Smt. Vijayakumari R, the learned counsel for the\npetitioner, vehemently contended that, S.T. Nos.2061 of 2019\nand 2062 of 2019 are proceedings under Section 138 of the\nNegotiable Instrument Act (for short ‘ the N.I.Act ’) and arose out\nof the same cause of action, and in view of the judgment in\nYogesh Upadhyay and Another v. Atlanta Ltd (AIR 2023\nSCC 1151) the cases are to be tried together and therefore,\ntransfer of one case by itself is prejudicial to the contentions of\n\n2024/KER/2902\n\nCRL.MC NO. 174 OF 2024\n\nthe accused. It is further submitted that, if the trial of one case\nalone is carried out, there could be possibility of contradictory\nfindings, and therefore, it is only appropriate that both cases are\n\ntried together and unless Annexure-Al order is set aside and\n\nS.T. No.2061 of 2019 is retained on the files of the Judicial First\n\nClass Magistrate-ll], Pathanamthitta, petitioner could be put to\nprejudice.\n\n3. | have heard the arguments of Sri. Noushad K.A.,\nlearned Public Prosecutor as well.\n\n4. In the decision in Yogesh Upadhyay’s case supra,\nthe Supreme Court had observed that, since the six complaint\ncases pertain to the same transactions, it would be advisable to\nhave a common adjudication to obviate the possibility of\ncontradictory findings being rendered in connection therewith by\ndifferent courts. The word used by the Supreme Court in the\naforesaid judgment is “ advisable and not mandatory “.\n\n5. On a perusal of the impugned order it is revealed\nthat, the same was issued on 28.03.2023 and the petitioner was\ndirected to appear before the Judicial First Class Magistrate-lll,\nPathanamthitta, on 19.04.2023. In all probabilities, the petitioner\n\nPls Bl\nnie\naa\n2024/KER/2902\nCRL.MC NO. 174 OF 2024\n.-4,.\nwould have appeared before the said court without any\nobjection. After acquiescing into Annexure-Al order and\nparticipating in the proceedings for the last 8 months, it is not\nproper to now turn around, on the eve of the trial of the case, to\nchallenge the said order of transfer.\nConsidering the above circumstances and the delay in\nchallenging Annexure-Al order, | am of the view that, this is not\na fit case to interfere under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. Accordingly,\nthis Criminal Miscellaneous case is dismissed.\nSd/-\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\nLU\n\nBeene\n2024/KER/2902\nCRL.MC NO. 174 OF 2024\n_.5..,\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 174/2024\n\nPETITIONER ANNEXURES :\nAnnexure - A 1 TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER IN\n\n$.T.NO.2061/2019 ISSUED BY THE JFCM-II,\n\nPATHANAMTHITTA DATED 28/03/2023\nAnnexure - A 2 TRUE COPY OF THE COMPLAINT FILED BY THE\n\nRESPONDENT IN S.T.NO.2061/2019 ON THE\n\nFILES OF JFCM-II, PATHANAMTHITTA\nAnnexure - A 3 TRUE COPY OF THE COMPLAINT FILED BY THE\n\nRESPONDENT IN S.T.NO.2062/2019 ON THE\n\nFILES OF JFCM-II, PATHANAMTHITTA\n\n// True Copy // PA To Judge\n\n"
