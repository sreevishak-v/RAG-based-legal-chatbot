The petitioner is the defacto\ncomplainant in a complaint alleging offence under Section 395 IPC.\nThe petitioner filed an application before the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate Court, Adimaly for release of the amount. But the\napplication was rejected on the ground that considering the nature\nof the offence and the fact that it has exclusively triable by the\nCourt of Sessions, and that Income Tax Authorities have been\nintimidate regarding the seizure and therefore, clearance from the\ndepartment has also to be obtained, and hence the amount could\nnot be released to the petitioner.\n\nBy sik el\n\ni a\n\noe\nCrl.M.Cs 9243/2019 & 9244/2019 2020/KER/LIS4\n\n4\n2. The reasons stated by the learned Magistrate for not\nreleasing the amount to the petitioner appears to be reasonable.\nBut however, being such a huge amount it is always appropriate\nthat it may be deposited in the fixed deposit earning interest, and\ntherefore the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Adimaly, is\ndirected to deposit the amount in an interest bearing deposit in a\nnationalised bank.\nCrl.M.Cs are disposed of as above.\nSd/-\nASHOK MENON\nJUDGE\n\nNR/16/01/20\n\nPIE\neee\nees\nCrl.M.Cs 9243/2019 & 9244/2019 2020/KERILIS4\n5\nAPPENDIX OF Crl.MC 9243/2019\nPETITIONER'S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE-A1 TRUE COPY OF FIR IN CRIME NO.877/2029 OF\nADIMALY POLICE STATION, IDUKKY DATED\n26.11.2019\nANNEXURE-A2 TRUE COPY OF CMP NO.3636 OF 2019 FILED BY\nTHE PETITIONER BEFORE THE JUDICIAL FIRST\nCLASS MAGISTRATE COURT, ADIMALY DATED\n28.11.2019\nANNEXURE-A3 TRUE COPY OF COMMON ORDER IN CMP NO 3567 OF\n2019 AND CMP 3636 OF 2019 OF THE JUDICIAL\nFIRST CLASS MAGISTRATE COURT, ADIMALY DATED\n18.12.2019\nRESPONDENTS' EXHIBITS: NIL\n// TRUE COPY// PA TO JUDGE\n\nPIE\neee\nees\nCrl.M.Cs 9243/2019 & 9244/2019 2020/KERILIS4\n6\nAPPENDIX OF Crl.MC 9244/2019\nPETITIONER'S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE-A1 TRUE COPY OF FIR IN CRIME NO.877/2029 OF\nADIMALY POLICE STATION, IDUKKY DATED\n26.11.2019\nANNEXURE-A2 TRUE COPY OF THE CMP NO.3567 OF 2019 FILED\nBY THE PETITIONER BEFORE THE JUDICIAL FIRST\nCLASS MAGISTRATE COURT, ADIMALY DATED\n28.11.2019\nANNEXURE-A3 CERTIFIED COPY OF COMMON ORDER IN CMP\nNO.3567 OF 2019 AND CMP 3636 OF 2019 OF THE\nJUDICIAL FIRST CLASS MAGISTRATE COURT,\nADIMALY DATED 18.12.2019\nRESPONDENTS' EXHIBITS: NIL\n// TRUE COPY// PA TO JUDGE\n\n"
