A. TO JUDGE\nPn\n\n2017/KER/1517\nSUNIL THOMAS, J.\nDated this the 11\" day of January, 2017\nORDER\n\nThe petitioners herein are the accused in Crime\nNo.620/2012 of Nadapuram Police Station for offences punishable\nunder Sections 143, 147, 148, 341, 323, 324, 294(b) read with\n149 of IPC. It was alleged by the prosecution that, on 22.12.2012\nat about 11.00 p.m., while the defacto complainant along with his\nfriend were proceeding along the road, the accused intercepted\nand attacked them using soda bottles and sticks. Complaint was\nlaid and on the basis of it crime was registered and investigation\nwas conducted. The matter was taken cognizance and is\npending.\n\n2. The petitioners have approached this Court contending\nthat the disputes between the parties have been resolved and\nthat the allegation against the petitioners herein have been\nsorted out. Learned counsel for the 2°¢ respondent, the defacto\ncomplainant invited my attention to Annexure 3 affidavit filed by\nhim wherein he has stated that the matter has been settled and\nhe has no objection in quashing the proceedings.\n\n3. The learned Public Prosecutor on_ instructions\nsubmitted that that dispute has been settled between the parties.\n\n2017/KER/1517\nCri. M. C. No. 7811 of 2016 2\nIt is further pointed out by the learned Public Prosecutor that the\n1** accused is involved in another crime under Sections 153A and\n307 IPC and the 2\" accused is involved in another proceeding\nunder Section 395 IPC. The other petitioners are not involved in\nany other case.\n\n4. It is evident that, antecedents of at least the 1*%* and 2\"\naccused are not very appreciable. Though this may dissuade the\ncourt from not permitting to quash the proceeding, taking into\nconsideration the fact that the other petitioners are not involved\nin any other crime and the allegations herein is also not very\nserious, | am inclined to take a lenient view and to permit the\nparties to have their disputes resolved to give an effect to the\nsettlement arrived at, on a belief that the petitioner herein will\nmend their ways and will not get themselves involved in any other\nfuture crime.\n\nIn the light of the above, Crl.M.C. is allowed. All further\nproceedings in Crime No.620/2012 of Nadapuram Police Station\nstand quashed.\n\nSd/-\n: SUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE.\nn\n\n"
