The petitioner has approached this Court to relax the\ncondition stating that he is a coolie worker and is doing work near\nhis house which situates within the village in which the victim\nresides. The court below by order in CMP No.3241/2017\ndismissed the application seeking relaxation of the above\ncondition.\n\n3. It appears that, having regard to the nature of\nallegations and to insulate the victim involved in this case, the\ncourt below has justifiably imposed the condition. However, the\ncase of the petitioner is that the petitioner herein is residing in the\nsame village. He earns his livelihood by doing sundry works\nwithin that limits, it is submitted.\n\nBREST\nFy, ent\napse\n2018/KER/512\nCri. M. C. No. 8737 of 2017 2\n4. It is seen that the final report has been laid. Having\nconsidered this, | am inclined to permit the petitioner to enter the\nlimits of the Police Station within whose jurisdiction the petitioner\nis residing as evident from the address of the accused. However,\nhe shall not in any manner threaten, coerce, intimidate or try to\ninfluence the victim or the witnesses.\nCrl.M.C. stands disposed of.\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS, JUDGE.\nPn\n\n"
