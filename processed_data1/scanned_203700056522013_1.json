CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON\n\n03-01-2017, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\ncoppers ee\nBeets\n2017/KER/53\nSUNIL THOMAS, J.\nCrl.M.C.No.5652 of 2013\nDated this the 3\" day of January, 2017\nORDER\n\nPetitioners are arrayed as accused Nos.1 and 2 in\n\nCrime No.1217 of 2013 of Kothamangalam Police Station for\n\noffences punishable under sections 7 and 8 of the Kerala Gaming\n\nAct, 1960.\n\n2. The allegation of the prosecution is that, on getting a\nsecret information that activities prohibited under the Gaming Act\nwere being carried out in the house of the first accused, police\nconducted a search and recovered a sum of Rs.64,200/- and a car.\nContending that the first accused is a totally handicapped person,\nbedridden and that, recovery was effected from the house of the\nfirst accused, further that the first and second accused are close\nfriends, and also that the source of money which was recovered\nfrom them can be proved by bank records, petitioners have\napproached this Court.\n\n3. It was contended by the learned counsel for the\npetitioners, relying on the decision reported in Sunil & Others v.\nState of Kerala & Another (2014(1) KHC 469), that the Act\n\nEreee\n2017/KER/53\nCrl.M.C.5652/13\n2\nwill apply only in case it is conducted in a common gaming place.\nAny place can be a common gaming place, if it is thrown open to or\naccessible to others. Learned Public Prosecutor submitted that\nsecret information was received and the second petitioner is an\noutsider. After investigation, final report has been laid and the\nmatter is pending as S.T.No.3816 of 2013 as submitted by the\nlearned Public Prosecutor. Essentially, these are questions of fact\nto be appreciated and established by the prosecution in evidence.\nHence, I am not inclined to invoke section 482 Cr.P.C at this stage.\nCrl.M.C fails and is dismissed.\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS\nJudge\n\nSbna/\n\nTrue Copy /\n\nP A to Judge\n\n"
