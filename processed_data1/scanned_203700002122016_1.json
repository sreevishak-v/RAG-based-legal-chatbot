What is under challenge is the validity of the\nanalysis report of the food involved in C.C. No.567/2011 of\nthe Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court-l, Aluva.\n\n3. Relying on the decision reported in Pepsico\nIndia Holdings Pvt. Ltd. v. Food Inspector and\nanother[2010 (4) KLT 706 (SC)j, this Court in\nGopalakrishnan v. Food Inspector[2013 (3) KLT 455] had\nheld that the provisions under Section 23(1A)(ee) and (hh)\nof the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act are mandatory\nand the same are applicable to all the food items.\n\nBl ts [a]\n2018/KER/700\nCRL.M.C.No. 212 of 2016 aoe\n\n4. The question involved in this case is the non\ncompliance of the mandatory provisions contained under\nSection 23(1A)(ee) and (hh) of the Prevention of Food\nAdulteration Act. As there was a divergent view in the\nmatter, the decision in Gopalakrishnan(supra) along with\nthe other decisions of the learned Single Judges were\nreferred to the Division Bench. The Division Bench of this\nCourt in Crl.R.P. No.1814/2002 considered the said question\nand has disposed of the matter through order dated\n17.11.2015, thereby upholding the view taken by this Court\nin Gopalakrishnan(supra).\n\n5. Matters being so, the continued prosecution of\nthe petitioners in C.C. No.567/2011 of the Judicial First\nClass Magistrate's Court-l, Aluva, are illegal and no purpose\nwould be served in proceeding with the matter any further.\nThe matters involved in the said case are quite unnecessary\nin view of the decisions noted supra and, therefore, the\nsame are liable to be quashed.\n\nBES h\n4\na\n2018/KER/700\nCRL.M.C.No. 212 of 2016\n-30-\n\nIn the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure A‘\ncomplaint and all further proceedings initiated against the\npetitioners in C.C.
