NOUSHAD K.A., PUBLIC PROSECUTOR\nBY SRI. AJAY JUEL KURIAKOSE\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n19.01.2024, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\ner\n2024/KER/5276\nCRL.MC NO. 43 OF 2024\n3\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, J.\n~ CrLM.C.No.43 of 2024\nDated this the 19\" day of January, 2024\nORDER\n\nPetitioners have invoked the jurisdiction under Section 482 Cr.P.C to\nquash all proceedings against them.\n\n2. Petitioners are accused 1 to 3 in Crime No.1064 of 2023 of\nMannancherry Police Station, Alappuzha, registered for the offences under\nSections 294(b), 341, 323, 324, 394 and 506 r/w Section 34 of the Indian Penal\nCode, 1860. The 2\" respondent is the defacto complainant.\n\n3. According to the prosecution, on 11.11.2023, the accused had\nassaulted the defacto complainant and took away an amount of Rs.7,500/- and\nfood packets from the defacto complainant after abusing him and thereby\ncommitted the offences alleged.\n\n4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned counsel\nfor the respondent, apart from the learned Public Prosecutor.\n\n5. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the matter has\nbeen settled and hence the proceedings against the petitioners ought to be\nquashed. It was also submitted that, considering the nature of offences alleged,\nno purpose would be served by continuing the proceedings.\n\n6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and Another [(2012) 10 SCC\n303], the Apex Court has held that in appropriate cases, the High Court can take\nnote of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim and the\nwrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. This view was reiterated in\n\nElz ae\n2024/KER/5276\nCRL.MC NO. 43 OF 2024\n4\nNarinder Singh and Others v. State of Punjab and Another [(2014) 6 SCC\n466] and Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State of Jharkhand and Another\n[(2014) 9 SCC 653].\n\n7. I have perused Annexure-A2 affidavit filed by the 2\"? respondent. The\nlearned Public Prosecutor has submitted that upon verification, it is understood\nthat the affidavit is genuine, and the defacto complainant stands by the contents\nthereof. I am satisfied that the matter has been settled and no public interest is\ninvolved in this case. There is no impediment for granting the prayer for\nquashing. The continuance of the proceedings will only be an exercise in futility.\n\n8. Accordingly, all proceedings against the _ petitioners in\nCrime No.1064 of 2023 of Mannancherry Police Station, Alappuzha are quashed.\n\nThis Crl.M.C is allowed as above.\n\nSd/-\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS, JUDGE\nRKM\n\nPR a\npee er\nBz Bere\n2024/KER/5276\nCRL.MC NO. 43 OF 2024\n5\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 43/2024\nPETITIONERS ' ANNEXURES :\nAnnexure Al THE TRUE COPY OF THE FIRST INFORMATION\nREPORT IN CRIME NO. 1064/2023 OF\nMANNANCHERRY POLICE STATION DATED\n12.11.2023\nAnnexure A2 A DULY ATTESTED AFFIDAVIT EXECUTED BY THE\n2ND RESPONDENT HEREIN DATED 29.12.2023\n\n"
