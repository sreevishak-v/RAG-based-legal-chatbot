Petitioners are accused Nos. 1 to 3 in C.C. No.395/2022 on the\nfiles of the judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kunnamangalam, arising\nour of Crime No.383/2022 of Kunnamangalam Police Station, registered for\nthe offences under Sections 341, 323, 324 and 506 r/w Section 34 of the\nIndian Penal Code, 1860. Second Respondent is the defacto complainant.\n\n3. According to the prosecution, on 13.01.2022, due to an enmity on\naccount of the defacto complainant preventing an attempt of ragging, the\naccused restrained the defacto complainant and assaulted him using a\nstick and thereby committed the offences alleged.\n\n4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned\ncounsel for the respondent, apart from the learned Public Prosecutor.\n\n5. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the matter\nhas been settled and hence the proceedings against the petitioners ought\nto be quashed. It was also submitted that, considering the nature of\noffences alleged, no purpose would be served by continuing the\nproceedings.\n\n2024/KER/4472\nCrl.M.C.No.90 of 2024\n4:\n\n6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and Another [(2012) 10 SCC\n303], the Apex Court has held that in appropriate cases, the High Court\ncan take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between the victim\nand the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal proceedings. This view\nwas reiterated in Narinder Singh and Others v. State of Punjab and\nAnother [(2014) 6 SCC 466] and Yogendra Yadav and Others v. State\nof Jharkhand and Another [(2014) 9 SCC 653].\n\n7. | have perused Annexure-3 affidavit filed by the second\nrespondent. The learned Public Prosecutor has submitted that upon\nverification, it is understood that the affidavit is genuine, and the defacto\ncomplainant stands by the contents thereof. | am satisfied that the matter\nhas been settled and no public interest is involved in this case. There is no\nimpediment for granting the prayer for quashing. The continuance of the\nproceedings will only be an exercise in futility.\n\n8. Accordingly, all proceedings against the petitioners in\nC.C. No.395/2022 on the files of the judicial First Class Magistrate Court,\nKunnamangalam, are quashed.\n\nThis Crl.M.C is allowed as above.\n\nSd/-\nBECHU KURIAN THOMAS\nJUDGE\nJka/19.01.24.\n\nBlige el\na ae\npees\n2024/KER/4472\nCrl.M.C.No.90 of 2024\n-51-\nAPPENDIX OF CRL.MC 90/2024\nPETITIONERS’ ANNEXURES\nAnnexure 1 CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FIR DATED 25.07.2022\nIN CRIME NO.383/2022 OF KUNNAMANGALAM\nPOLICE STATION.\nAnnexure 2 CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FINAL REPORT DATED\n31.08.2022 IN CRIME NO.383/2022 OF\nKUNNAMANGALAM POLICE STATION\nAnnexure 3 TRUE COPY OF THE AFFIDAVIT DATED\n14,12.2023 SWORN TO BY THE DE-FACTO\nCOMPLAINANT/ 2ND RESPONDENT\n\n"
