This case is instituted upon the Final Report filed by the Sub Inspector of\nPolice, Sreekaryam Police Station in Crime No. 52/2023 for the offences\npunishable under Sections 294(b), 323, 341 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860\n(hereinafter referred to as the ‘IPC’).\n2. The Prosecution allegation in brief is as follows: Due to the prior animosity\ntowards the Informant, the Accused persons in furtherance of their common\nintention, wrongfully restrained the Informant inside St. Paul’s Lutheran church,\nGandhipuram at 9.30 am on 14.01.2023, uttered obscene words to him and\nvoluntarily caused hurt to the Informant. Thereby the Accused are alleged to have\ncommitted offences punishable under Sections 294(b), 323, 341 r/w 34 of the IPC.\n3. The cognizance was taken on the basis of Final Report in respect of the\naforesaid offences. On issuance of process, the Accused entered appearance before\nthis Court. They were enlarged on bail. They were represented by a Counsel of\ntheir own choice. Copies of all relevant Prosecution records were furnished to\nthem. After hearing both parties and on perusing relevant records, the particulars\n\n3\n\nof the offences punishable under Sections 294(b), 323, 341 r/w 34 of IPC was read\nover and explained to them, to which they pleaded not guilty and claimed to be\ntried.\n4. From the side of Prosecution CW1 alone was examined as PW1 and Exhibit\nP1 was marked. The remaining witnesses were given up by the Learned APP as\nthe material witness, the injured himself had turned hostile to the case of\nProsecution. Since no incriminating circumstances arose from the deposition of the\nwitness and materials on record, the examination of the Accused under Section\n313(1)(b) of the CrPC was dispensed with. No Defence evidence was also adduced.\n5. Heard both sides and perused the documents. The following points arise for\nconsideration:\n\n(a) Have the Accused persons, in furtherance of their common intention,\n\nuttered obscene words to PW1 and thereby committed the offence\n\npunishable under section 294 (b) r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged?\n\n(b) Have the Accused persons, in furtherance of their common intention,\n\nvoluntarily caused hurt to PW1 and thereby committed offence punishable\n\nunder Section 323 r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged?\n\n(c) Have the Accused persons, in furtherance of their common intention,\n\nwrongfully restrained PWI1 and thereby committed offence punishable\n\nunder Section 341 r/w 34 of the IPC as alleged?\n\n(d) If so, what shall be the proper sentence to be awarded?\n6. Points (a) to (c): These points are considered together for the sake of\nbrevity and for avoiding repetition.\n\nPW1 deposed that the incident occurred 14.01.2023 at 9.30 at St. Paul’s\nLutheran church, Gandhipuram. He was restrained and assaulted by few persons\non his way to the Church. They pushed and punched him. He did not sustain\n\n4\n\nserious injuries. He had gone for treatment initially to the Health Centre and\nthereafter to the Medical College. He deposed that he gave Exhibit P1 Statement\nto the police. He categorically denied the Accused having assaulted, restrained\nhim, or uttered obscene words to him. On specific question put forth by the\nLearned APP, he deposed that the Accused are the relatives of his wife and that\nthey have settled the matter between them and accordingly filed a Compounding\nPetition before this Court.\n\nOn perusal of the evidence led by the Prosecution and the materials on\nrecord, it is clear from the testimony of PW1 that there is no evidence to support\nthe Prosecution case. PW1 admits having sustained injuries but there is no\nwhisper that that it was the Accused persons who had allegedly assaulted and\nrestrained him or showered obscene words on him. In the aforesaid\ncircumstances, the remaining witness was given up by the Prosecution as no\npurpose would be served in examining them. Neither the ingredients of the alleged\noffences, nor the involvement of the Accused persons brought out in the evidence\nadduced by the Prosecution. Furthermore, the as is evident from the deposition of\nPW1, the parties on account of their settlement had filed Compounding Petition as\nCMP 3984/2024, and the same was dismissed by this Court as alleged offences\nincluded commission of non-compoundable offence. Thus, this Court is of the view\nthat the Prosecution has miserably failed to prove the involvement of this Accused\npersons in the above Crime beyond reasonable doubt. This Court finds that the\nProsecution has failed to prove the case against the Accused and therefore, Points\n(a) to (c) are found in favour of the Accused.\n\n7. Point (d): In light of finding in the foregoing points, this point does not\narise for consideration.\n\n8. In the result, the 1‘, 2°? and 3% Accused are found not guilty of having\ncommitted the offences punishable under Sections 294(b), 323, 341 r/w 34 of the\n\n5\nIPC. They are acquitted of the aforesaid offences under Section 255(1) of the CrPC.\nTheir bail bond stands cancelled and they are set at liberty.\n(Dictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by her, corrected by\nme and pronounced in open Court on this, the 27\" day of January, 2025.)\nJudicial Magistrate of I Class -I,\nThiruvananthapuram\nAPPENDIX\nA: Prosecution witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nPW1 Ratheesh R S(CW1) examined |Occurrence witness\non 03.01.2025\nB: Defence witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\nC: Court witness\nRank Name Whether Eye witness,\nPolice witness, Expert\nwitness, Medical\nwitness, Other witness\n\n6\nList of Prosecution/Defence/Court Exhibits\nA.
