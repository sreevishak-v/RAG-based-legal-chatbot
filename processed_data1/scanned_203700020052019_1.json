There were three accused in the\ncrime and the petitioners were absconding and the trial\nproceeded against the 3rd accused as S.T. No.2522/2012 on the\nfiles of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Kodungallur.\nThe 3â„¢ accused who faced trial was found not guilty and\nacquitted by the Jurisdictional Magistrate under Section 255(1)\nof Cr.P.C, vide judgment at Annexure Al dated 8.12.2017. On\nappreciation of evidence let in by Pws1 and 2, it was found that\nit was not reliable and there were certain discrepancies which\nled to the acquittal of the 3 accused. Since accused 1 and 2\nwere absconding and the case against them was split up and\nrefiled and presently pending as S.T No.3076/2017 on the files\nof the same court. The petitioner contends that in view of the\nacquittal of the 3% accused, they are also entitled to similar\nconsideration and hence the case against them may be quashed\nunder Section 482 of Cr.P.C.\n\noR\nCrl.MC.No.2005 OF 2019(A) 3 2020/KER/I6\n\n2. A reading of Annexure Al judgment indicates that it\nwas on appreciation of evidence let in by witnesses that the\ncourt below found it difficult to convict the 3 accused. On the\nbasis of the appreciation of evidence, it is not possible to quash\nthe proceedings under Section 482 of Cr.P.C. The petitioner will\nhave to face the trial and the extra ordinary power under Section\n482 of CrP.C cannot be exercised in favour of the petitioners to\nquash the proceedings in the crime.\n\nThe Crl.M.C. is therefore dismissed.\n\nSD/-\nASHOK MENON\nJUDGE\n\nxmm\n\nee\nAeris ua\nAste\nEl: 4 ie\nCrl.MC.No.2005 OF 2019(A) 4 2020/KER/16\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE Al THE TRUE COPY OF THE ORDER, DATED\n8/12/2017, BY THE JUDICIAL FIRST CLASS\nMAGISTRATE COURT, KODUNGALLUR IN ST\nNO.2522/12.\n\n"
