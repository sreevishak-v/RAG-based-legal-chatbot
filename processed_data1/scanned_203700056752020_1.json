CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n04.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nCrl.MC.No.5675 OF 2020 (H) LoB.. 202 /KER/TIA\nORDER\n\nDated this the 4th day of January 2021\n\nPetitioners are the accused in Crime\nNo.831/2019 registered at the Nadakkavu Police\nStation for offences punishable under Sections 143,\n147, 148, 323, 324 r/w 149 of IPC, now pending as\nC.C.No.3/2020 on the files of the Judicial First Class\nMagistrate Court-IV, Kozhikode. The de _ facto\ncomplainant and the other persons injured are\narrayed as respondents 3 to 5. Annexures-A3 to Ad\naffidavits have been filed by the said respondents\nstating that the dispute, which was the reason for\nthe incident and registration of the crime, has been\nresolved amicably and they no subsisting grievance\nagainst the petitioners.\n\nCrl1.MC.No.5675 OF 2020 (H) AL, 202UKERILI4\n\n2. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor also,\nwho, on instructions, submits that the petitioners\nhave no criminal antecedents.\n\n3. Having considered the gravity of the offences\nalleged, nature of the injury caused and having\nperused the affidavits filed by respondents 3 to 5, the\ncontents of which are submitted to be true and\nvoluntary, I am satisfied that the dispute is settled\nand no public interest is involved in this matter. The\nfact that both petitioners as well as the de facto\ncomplainants were students is also taken into\nconsideration. Moreover, in view of the settlement,\npossibility of the criminal proceedings ending in\nconviction is remote. As such, continuance of the\nproceedings will amount to an abuse of process of\ncourt and hence, in view of the legal position set out\nby the Honourable Supreme Court in Madan\n\nCrl1.MC.No.5675 OF 2020 (H) Be, 202UKERILI4\nMohan Abbot v. State of Punjab [(2008) 4 SCC\n982] and Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and\nanother [(2012) 10 SCC 303], there is no\nimpediment in granting the relief sought.\n\nIn the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed. The\nproceedings in C.C.No.3/2020 on the files of the\nJudicial First Class Magistrate Court-IV, Kozhikode is\nquashed.\n\nSd/-\nV.G.ARUN\nSB/04/01/2021 JUDGE\n\nare\nSee\nceva\neee\nCrl.MC.No.5675 OF 2020(H) .6.. 2021/KER/114\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE Al THE CERTIFIED COPY OF THE F.I.R.
