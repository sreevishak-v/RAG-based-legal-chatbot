The matter is\npending before the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Kozhikode as\nC.C.No.115 of 2007.\n\n2. Allegation against the petitioner, in brief, is that while the\npetitioner was functioning as AlICC Working Committee member, he held a\npress conference at Hoiel Malabar Palace, Kozhikode on 28.04.2006 ai\nabout 11 a.m. in violation of the provisions contained in Section 126 of the\nAct. Section 126 of the Act reads as follows:\n\n“Prohibition of public meetings during\nperiod of forty-eight hours ending with hour\nfixed for conclusion of poll.- (1) No person\nshall-\n\n(a) convene, hold, attend, join or address\nany public meeting or procession in connection\nwith an election; or\n\n2014/KER/49\nCrl.MC No.397/2010 2\n\n(b) display to the public any election\nmatter by means of cinematograph, television or\nother similar apparatus; or\n\n(c) propagate any election matter to the\npublic by holding, or by arranging the holding of,\nany musical concert or any theatrical performance\nor any other entertainment or amusement with a\nview to attracting the members of the public\nthereto,\nin any polling area during the period of forty-eight\nhours ending with the hour fixed for the conclusion\nof the poll for any election in that polling area.\n(2) Any person who contravenes the provisions\nof sub-section (1) shall be punishable with\nimprisonment for a term which may extend to two\nyears, or with fine, or with both.\n(3) In this section, the expression “election\nmatter” means any matter intended or calculated to\ninfluence or affect the result of election.”\n\n3. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned\nPublic Prosecutor.\n4. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the\n\nBeas\n2014/KER/49\n\nCrl.MC No.397/2010 3\n\nprosecution is legally unsustainable for multiple reasons. According to him,\nthe offence alleged to have been committed by the petitioner is not a\ncognizable offence. Sub-section (2) of Section 126 of the Act would show\nthat the punishment prescribed is upto two years imprisonment and\ntherefore, it can only be regarded as a summons case defined in Section 2\n(w) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in short, “the Cr.P.C.”). My\nattention was drawn to Sections 129, 130, 132 and 134 of the Act. Section\n132 of the Act deals with penalty for misconduct at the polling station.\nThe offence prescribed under Section 132 of the Act is made cognizable\nby the statute itself. To buttress the contention that the prosecution is bad,\nlearned counsel for the petitioner relied on the decision of the Supreme\nCourt in Jeewan Kumar Raut & another v. Central Bureau of\nInvestigation (AIR 2009 SC 2763). That was a case involving an offence\npunishable under Section 22 of the Transplantation of Human Organs Aci,\n1994. Considering the statutory provisions, the Supreme Court held that\nthe offence therein could be taken cognizance only on a complaint made\nby the appropriate authority or person and not by registering a FIR. This\nCourt while considering the provisions of Protection of River Banks and\nRegulation of Removal of Sand Act, 2001 held in Abdul Azeez v. State of\nKerala (2010 (1) KLT 394) that the offences under the Sand Act cannot be\nsuo motu taken by the Police under the provisions of the Cr.PC.\n\n2014/KER/49\nCrl.MC No.397/2010 4\nConsidering these submissions, | am satisfied that the launching of\nprosecution is not legally sustainable.\n\n5. On facts also, submitted the learned counsel for the\npetitioner, the statements produced along with the final report will not show\nthat there was a press conference held by the petitioner as alleged by the\nprosecution. It is contended on behalf of the petitioner that he occupied a\nroom in the hotel and some press people might have contacted him at his\nroom. It is further contended that this cannot be termed as a press\nconference attracting the offence under Section 126 of the Act. 1 am\nsatisfied that the petitioner has made out a case that the alleged offence is\nnot attracted in this case. Therefore | find that the petition is to be allowed\nto meet the ends of justice.\n\nIn the result, the petition is allowed. Final report in C.C.No.115\nof 2007 on the file of Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Kozhikode is hereby\nquashed.\n\nAll pending interlocutory applications will stand dismissed.\n\nA. HARIPRASAD, JUDGE.\ncks\n\n"
