No.620/2025\n(Crime No.127/2025 of Vattiyoorkkavu Police Station)\nPetitioner/Accused_No.3:-\n\nSiva K.S, aged 19 years,\n\nS/o Krishna Swami,\n\nKPNRA 130, TC.10/2186,\n\nKanjirampara P.O,\n\nThiruvananthapuram 695030\n\nBy Advocate:-Nithin Santosh\nRespondent:-\nState of Kerala represented by the Sub Inspector of Police,\nVattiyoorkavu Police Station\nBy Public Prosecutor Dr. T. Geenakumary\n\nThis petition came up for hearing on 03/03/2025 and the court on 04/03/2025\npassed the following :\n\nORDER\n\nThis is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik\nSuraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail.\n\n2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences punishable\nunder Sections 126(2), 115(2), 117(2) and 118(2), r/w Section 3(5) of the\nBharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, and Crime No. 127/2025 of Vattiyoorkavu Police\nStation is registered against the petitioner arraying him as the 3 accused.\n\nCriminal M.C.No.620/2025 1/5\n\n3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- On 07.02.2025 at\nabout 9.45 p.m., inside Surendra Bar, situated at Manchadimoodu, Vattiyoorkavu,\na wordy altercation occurred between the husband of the defacto complainant\nand accused Nos.1 and 2, and thereafter, accused Nos.1 and 2 fisted and beat on\nthe face of the victim, pulled him down and kicked him repeatedly. When the\nvictim went out of the Bar, accused Nos.1 and 2 along with the 3™ accused\nwrongfully restrained him, and at that time, the 1* accused fisted on the face of\nthe victim repeatedly, using an iron bangle, causing fracture to his nasal bone.\nWhen the victim fell down, accused Nos. 2 to 6 beat, fisted and kicked on various\nparts of his body.\n\n4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor. The\nInvestigating Officer filed report opposing the pre-arrest bail application.\n\n5. Heard. Perused the records.\n\n6. The only point to be considered is, whether pre-arrest bail can be\ngranted to the petitioner/ 3™ accused.\n\n7. The Point:- The defacto complainant is the wife of the victim. The\npetitioner/ 3 accused along with the other accused are alleged to have attacked\nthe victim, and the petitioner / 3\" accused had restrained the victim to help the 1*\naccused to attack him, using an iron bangle, causing injuries, and the petitioner\n\nCriminal M.C.No.620/2025 2/5\n\nhad beaten, fisted and kicked the victim. The alleged incident has happened inside\nand outside a Bar, and the motive for the incident is the enmity that arose, when a\nwordy altercation occurred between the victim and the accused persons.\n\n8. According to the petitioner, he is innocent of the allegations levelled\nagainst him. It is submitted by the petitioner that, he is the friend of the 1*\naccused, and on 07.02.2025, while the petitioner along with his friends were\ntaking food in front of Surendra Bar, they saw a scuffle in front of the Bar,\nassaulting the husband of the defacto complainant by the 1* and 2\" accused in the\ncrime. It is also submitted that, when the local people gathered there, the\nassailants moved away from there, and thereafter, the 1* accused falsely\nimplicated the petitioner in the present crime.\n\n9. There is serious allegation as against the petitioner. It is seen from\nthe report filed by the Investigating Officer that, the petitioner/ 3\"! accused had\nrestrained the victim and aided 1* accused to hit on the face of the victim, using an\niron bangle, causing serious injuries, and he along with the other accused had\nbeaten, fisted and kicked the victim. In the accident register-cum-wound\ncertificate appended with the report filed by the Investigating Officer, it is seen\nthat, the victim sustained comminuted fracture of frontal process of maxilla,\ndisplaced fracture of right nasal bone and undisplaced fracture of left nasal bone.\n\nCriminal M.C.No.620/2025 3/5\n\nIt is stated in the report that the wound certificate and the treatment certificate of\nthe victim were obtained. It is also stated in the report that the recovery of the\nweapon used for the commission of the offence is to be effected. It is reported that\nthe petitioner is implicated in this crime on verification of CCTV footage. So, the\nprosecution has made out a prima facie case against the petitioner/ 3 accused and\nregarding the involvement of the petitioner in the alleged offence. The\ninvestigation is progressing. It is stated in the report that the petitioner is involved\nin two other crimes. Considering the facts stated in the report to the effect that the\npetitioner is involved in the offence, it appears that exceptional jurisdiction to\ngrant a pre-arrest bail cannot be exercised in this case.\n\n10. In Jai Prakash Singh v. State of Bihar and Another (2012 (4) SCC\n379), the Hon’ble Apex court has held that, an order of pre-arrest bail being an\nextra ordinary privilege, should be granted only in exceptional cases. It is settled\nin law that arrest should be the last option and it should be restricted to cases\nwhere arrest is imperative in the facts and circumstances of a case and consistent\nview is that the grant of anticipatory bail shall be restricted to exceptional\ncircumstances. So it is clear that the power to grant anticipatory bail under section\n482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita is an exceptional power and should\nbe exercised only in exceptional cases and not as a matter of course. Its object is to\n\nCriminal M.C.No.620/2025 4/5\n\nensure that a person should not be harassed or humiliated in order to satisfy the\ngrudge or personal vendetta of the complainant. [Reliance placed on the decision\nrendered by the Hon’ble Apex Court in HDFC Bank Limited v. J.J. Mannan and\nAnother (2010 (1) SCC 679); Srikant Upadhyay v. State of Bihar (2024 KHC\nOnline 6137)]. In the case at hand, I find no exceptional circumstance to exercise\nthe exceptional power of granting anticipatory bail.\n\n11. Considering the serious allegation against the petitioner and gravity of\nthe offence, it appears that granting the petitioner with an order of anticipatory bail\nwill adversely affect the investigation. If an order of anticipatory bail is granted he\nis likely to influence the witnesses and tamper with the evidence. Considering all\nthese aspects, this court is not inclined to grant an order of pre-arrest bail to the\npetitioner.\n\nIn the result, this petition is dismissed.\nDictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and pronounced\nby me in Open Court on this the 4\" day of March, 2025.\nSd/-\nNAZEERA.S\nSESSIONS JUDGE\n(Copies : 4) //True Copy// (By Order)\nTyped by: Soumya\nCompared by:Manjusha FCS: SHERISTADAR\nCriminal M.C.No.620/2025 5/5\n\nCopy of Order in\nCriminal M.C.No.620/2025\nDated 04/03/2025\nCriminal M.C.No.620/2025 6/5\n\n"
