No.594/2025\n(Crime No. 179/2025 of Chirayinkeezhu Police Station )\nPetitioner/Accused No.1:-\n\nSanthosh R, aged 34 years, S/o Raveendran, residing at\n\nVayalthittaveedu, Kambykkayam, Kuzhiyam Colony,\n\nPerunguzhi, Chirayinkeezhu, Thiruvananthapuram.\n\nBy Advocates. Vinod Kumar S and Jiju S\nCOUNTER PETITIONER:-\nState of Kerala represented by\nStation House officer, Chirayinkeezhu Police Station.\nBy Public Prosecutor Dr T Geena Kumary\n\nThis Crl.M.C. came up for hearing on 25/02/2025 and the court on\n28-02-2025 passed the following :\n\nORDER\n\nThis is an application filed under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik\nSuraksha Sanhita, seeking pre-arrest bail.\n\n2. The petitioner is alleged to have committed the offences\npunishable under Sections 329(3), 115(2), 118(1), 110 and 74, r/w Section 3(5)\nof the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, and Crime No. 179/2025 of Chirayinkeezhu\nPolice Station is registered against the petitioner arraying him as the\n1* accused.\n\n3. The prosecution allegation in brief is as follows:- Due to enmity,\n\nCriminal M.C.No.594/2025 1/5\n\non 06.02.2025 at about 11.45 p.m., accused Nos. 1 and 2 trespassed into the\ncourtyard of the residence of the defacto complainant, situated near\nArattukadavu Junction in Azhoor Village, and the 1° accused, by using a\nchopper, hacked towards the head of the defacto complainant, and when she\nobstructed the said act with her left hand, it fell upon her left palm, causing an\ninjury. Thereafter, the 2\" accused, by using the chopper, hacked towards the\nson of the defacto complainant, and when the defacto complainant prevented the\nsame, it fell upon her left palm, causing an injury, and at that time, the\n1* accused pressed on the neck of the defacto complainant, and beat her on her\nshoulder and chest, and when the pregnant daughter of the defacto complainant\nintervened, the 1* accused slapped on her face and caught hold of her hair and\npushed her down.\n\n4. Notice in this bail application is issued to the Public Prosecutor.\nThe Investigating Officer filed report opposing the anticipatory bail application.\n\n5. Heard. Perused the records.\n\n6. The only point to be considered is, whether an order of\nanticipatory bail can be granted to the petitioner/ 1* accused.\n\n7. The Point:- The petitioner / 1* accused along with the other\naccused are alleged to have trespassed into the courtyard of the residence of the\ndefacto complainant, and attacked her and her family members, using a\nchopper, causing injuries. The motive of the alleged incident is, the enmity that\n\nCriminal M.C.No.594/2025 2/5\n\narouse when the defacto complainant wamed the 2™ accused, when the\n2\" accused tried to hide near her house.\n\n8. According to the petitioner, he is innocent of the allegations\nlevelled against him. It is submitted that, the petitioner and the defacto\ncomplainant are neighbours and there exists a property dispute between them,\nand due to that enmity, the present false complaint has been filed against the\npetitioner.\n\n9. The magnitude of the offence alleged is grave. It is seen from the\nFirst Information Statement given by the defacto complainant that the\npetitioner/ 1* accused had hacked the defacto complainant on her head, which\nwhen prevented, fell upon her left hand, causing an injury, and pressed on her\nneck and had beaten on her shoulder and chest, and thereafter, slapped on the\nface of the pregnant daughter of the defacto complainant and pushed her down.\nIt is seen from the body note in the first Information Statement that ,the left\npalm and wrist of the defacto complainant were seen dressed and there are\nswelling on both her shoulders and back. It is seen from the wound certificate\nappended with the report filed by the Investigating Officer that the defacto\ncomplainant sustained injury over the left hand, wound over the left forearm of\n2 cm and multiple abrasions over the left palm. So there are corresponding\ninjuries. It is stated in the report that the chopper used for the commission of\nthe offence is recovered. So the prosecution has made out a prima facie case\n\nCriminal M.C.No.594/2025 3/5\n\nagainst the petitioner / 1* accused and regarding the involvement of the\npetitioner / 1“ accused in the alleged offence. It is stated in the report that the\ninvestigation is in its preliminary stage and the statement of more witnesses are\nto be recorded and more evidence is to be collected. Considering the facts\nstated in the report to the effect that the petitioner is involved in the offence, it\nappears that exceptional jurisdiction to grant a pre-arrest bail cannot be\nexercised in this case.\n\n10. In Jai Prakash Singh v. State of Bihar and Another (2012 (4)\nSCC 379), the Hon’ble Apex court has held that, an order of pre-arrest bail\nbeing an extra ordinary privilege, should be granted only in exceptional cases.\nIt is settled in law that arrest should be the last option and it should be restricted\nto cases where arrest is imperative in the facts and circumstances of a case and\nconsistent view is that the grant of anticipatory bail shall be restricted to\nexceptional circumstances. So it is clear that the power to grant anticipatory\nbail under section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita. is an\nexceptional power and should be exercised only in exceptional cases and not as\na matter of course. Its object is to ensure that a person should not be harassed or\nhumiliated in order to satisfy the grudge or personal vendetta of the\ncomplainant. [Reliance placed on the decision rendered by the Hon’ble Apex\nCourt in HDFC Bank Limited v. J.J. Mannan and Another (2010 (1) SCC\n679); Srikant Upadhyay v. State of Bihar (2024 KHC Online 6137)]. In the\n\nCriminal M.C.No.594/2025 4/5\n\ncase at hand, I find no exceptional circumstance to exercise the exceptional\npower of granting anticipatory bail.\n\n11. Considering the serious allegation against the petitioner and gravity\nof the offence, it appears that granting the petitioner with an order of\nanticipatory bail will adversely affect the investigation. If an order of\nanticipatory bail is granted, he is likely to influence the witnesses and tamper\nwith the evidence. Considering all these aspects, this court is not inclined to\ngrant an order of pre-arrest bail to the petitioner.\n\nIn the result, this petition is dismissed.\nDictated to the Confidential Assistant, transcribed and typed by him, corrected and pronounced by\nme in Open Court on this the 28\" day of February, 2025.\nSd/-\nNAZEERA S.\nSESSIONS JUDGE\n(Copies : 4)\nTyped by: Rifa True copy By Order\nCompared by: Manjusha\nFCS:\nSHERISTADAR\nCriminal M.C.No.594/2025 5/5\n\nCopy of Order in\nCriminal M.C.No.594/2025\nDated: 28/02/2025\nCriminal M.C.No.594/2025 6/5\n\n"
