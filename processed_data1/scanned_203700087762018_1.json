SRI.P.YADHU KUMAR\nSMT. REKHA C. NAIR SR. PP.\nTHIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON\n09.01.2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nbie\nCrl.MC.No. 8776 of 2018 201KER/T24S\n2\nORDER\n\nThis petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure (‘the Code” for brevity) with a prayer to quash the\nproceedings pending against the petitioner.\n\n2. The petitioner herein is the accused in C.C. No.1111 of\n2018 on the file of the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court, Vaikom.\nIn the aforesaid case, he stands indicted for having committed\noffence punishable under Sections 323, 324, 294(b) and 506(i) of\nthe IPC. The 3™ respondent is the wife of the petitioner herein.\n\n3. I have heard the learned counsel appearing for the\npetitioner, the party respondent and the learned Public Prosecutor.\nIt is submitted that the entire disputes between the parties have\nbeen amicably resolved. Attention of this Court is invited to the\naffidavit filed by the 3 respondent to buttress his submission. It is\nurged that the dispute is purely personal in nature and would not\naffect public peace or tranquility.\n\n4. The learned Public Prosecutor, on instructions, submitted\nthat the statement of the 3 respondent has been recorded and she\n\nbie\nCrl.MC.No. 8776 of 2018 201KER/T24S\n3\nhas stated in clear terms that she has no subsisting grievance.\n\n5. I have considered the submissions advanced.\n\n6. In Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [(2012) 10 SCC 303]\nand in Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab [(2014) 6 SCC 466],\nthe Apex Court has laid down that in appropriate cases, the High\nCourt can take note of the amicable resolution of disputes between\nthe victim and the wrongdoer to put an end to the criminal\nproceedings.\n\n7. The offence committed by the petitioner cannot be said to\nbe grave and serious having ingredients of extreme mental\ndepravity. It also does not appear that the offence in this case will\nhave a serious impact on the society. It is felt that quashing of\nproceedings on account of compromise would bring about peace and\nsecure the ends of justice. Even otherwise, persisting with the\nprosecution would be nothing but a waste of time as the prospects\nof conviction is bleak. Having considered all the relevant\ncircumstances, I am of the considered view that this Court will be\nwell justified in invoking its extraordinary powers under Section 482\nof the Code to quash the proceedings.\n\nnas Lets i]\nEl sas\nCrl.MC.No. 8776 of 2018 2019/KER/1245\n4\nIn the result, this petition will stand allowed. Annexure-A FIR\nand all proceedings pursuant thereto against the petitioner now\npending as C.C. No. 1111 of 2018 on the file of Judicial Magistrate of\nFirst Class, Vaikom are quashed.\nSD/-\nRAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN V.,\nJUDGE\n//TRUE COPY// P.A.
