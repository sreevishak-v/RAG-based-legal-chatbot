CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 05-\n12-2019, THE COURT ON 06-01-2020 PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nGiga\n\n2020/KER/81\nCr1.M.C.No.6072/2019\n2\nR.NARAYANA PISHARADI, J\n2K 2K OK 2K 2K 2K 2K OK 2K OK 2K 2K OK 2K OK 2K 2k OK ok 2K OK 2K Ok\nCrl.M.C.No.6072 of 2019\nDated this the 6\" day of January, 2020\nORDER\n\nThe petitioners are the first and the second accused in the\ncase registered as O.R.No.3/2019 of the Mankulam Forest Range\nOffice.\n\n2. The offences alleged against the petitioners are under\nSections 27(1)(a), 27(1)(e)(i) and 27(1)(e)(iv) of the Kerala\nForest Act, 1961.\n\n3. The prosecution case is as follows: On 26.06.2019,\nwhen the Section Forest Officer conducted inspection of the Kallar\nSection of the reserve forest with forest officials, he found the\nbamboo and the undergrowth there being cut and destroyed from\nan area of half acres of forest. Then they heard sound from the\nnearby place and when they reached there, they saw accused 3\n\n2020/KER/81\nCr1.M.C.No.6072/2019 3\nto 7 cutting and destroying the bamboo and the undergrowth\nthere. The statements of the aforesaid persons revealed that\nthey were employed by the first and the second accused to do\nthe work.\n\n4. This petition is filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C for\nquashing the proceedings against the petitioners in the case\nregistered as O.R.No.3/2019 in relation to the aforesaid incident.\n\n5. Heard learned counsel for the petitioners and the\nlearned Public Prosecutor.\n\n6. The plea of the petitioners is as follows: The\npetitioners are in absolute possession of 2 Acres and 47 cents of\nland in Mankulam Village. The aforesaid land has been in their\nabsolute possession since the year 1995. They had cultivated\nthe aforesaid land with black pepper, arecanut, coconut trees,\nmango trees etc. There are also two houses situated in the\naforesaid land. The petitioners, along with some other persons,\nhad filed W.P.(C) No.14674/2007 before this Court claiming\nbenefit of the Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 2005 and\nthe Kerala Stay of Eviction Proceedings Act, 2005 seeking a\n\n2020/KER/81\n\nCr1.M.C.No.6072/2019 1\ndeclaration that they are eligible and entitled to get certificates of\ntitle to the property mentioned above. The aforesaid writ petition\nwas disposed of by this Court as per Annexure-3 judgment by\ndirecting the petitioners to raise their claims before the\nconcerned authority. It was also ordered that status quo as on\nthe date of judgment shall continue. The petitioners have filed\napplication before the Forest Settlement Officer, Mankulam and\nthe Revenue Divisional Officer, Devikulam for getting certificates\nof title in respect of their land. When the revenue authorities\ncame to the property of the petitioners, the officials of Mankulam\nForest Range did not permit them to survey the said property.\nThe Revenue Divisional Officer had informed the petitioners to\nclear the bushes and shrubs for conducting survey. The\npetitioners engaged their workers for clearing the grass, bushes\nand shrubs. The workers so engaged by the petitioners are\nimplicated in the case registered by the forest officials. The\npetitioners have not committed any offence alleged against them.\n\n7. Learned counsel for the petitioners has contended that\nAnnexure-3 judgment of this Court would show that the\n\n2020/KER/81\nCr1.M.C.No.6072/2019 5\npetitioners are in possession of the land in question and that it is\nnot a forest area. Learned counsel for the petitioners would also\ninvite the attention of this Court to the direction made by this\nCourt in Annexure-3 judgment that status quo shall continue in\nrelation to the land.\n\n8. It is true that there is a direction in Annexure-3\njudgment that the petitioners can approach the concerned\nauthority raising their claim and then the concerned authority\nshall adjudicate the claim and pass orders and until such time,\nstatus quo as on the date of the judgment will continue.\nHowever, it is to be noted that, the direction in Annexure-3\njudgment that status quo will continue, is applicable to the\npetitioners also.\n\n9. It is admitted in the petition that the petitioners had\nemployed accused 3 to 7 in the case to clear the grass, shrubs\nand bushes in the disputed land. However, there is a specific\nrecital in the spot mahazar prepared by the Section Forest Officer\nthat the workers of the petitioners had cut the bamboo in the\ndisputed land. Learned counsel for the petitioners would submit\n\n2020/KER/81\nCr1.M.C.No.6072/2019 ,\nthat they have not cut any bamboo from the land in question.\nHowever, in a petition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C, this Court\ncannot decide such disputed facts.\n\n10. The offences alleged against the petitioners are under\nSections 27(1) (a), 27(1)(e)(i) and 27(1)(e)(iv) of the Kerala\nForest Act. Section 27(1) (a) of the Act prescribes the\npunishment for committing any act prohibited by Section 7 of the\nAct. Section 7 of the Act provides that, during the interval\nbetween the publication of the notification under Section 4 and\nthe date fixed by the notification under Section 19, no right shall\nbe acquired in or over the land included in such notification under\nSection 4 except under a grant or contract in writing made or\nentered into by, or on behalf of, the Government, or by, or on\nbehalf of, some person in whom such right, or power to create\nthe same was vested when the notification under Section 4 was\npublished, or by succession from such person; and no clearings\nshall be made on such land, nor shall any person cut, collect, or\nremove any forest produce not shall set fire to such land or\nkindle or leave burning any fire in such manner as to endanger\n\n2020/KER/81\nCr1.M.C.No.6072/2019 ;\nthe same. In the instant case, admittedly, there is a notification\nissued by the government under Section 4 of the Act on\n16.05.2007 in respect of the land in dispute proposing to\nconstitute it as reserve forest.\n\n11. Section 27(1)(e)(i) of the Act presrbies the punishment\nfor a person, who, in a Reserved Forest or in a land proposed to\nbe constituted a Reserved Forest cultivates or clears or breaks up\nany land for cultivation or for any other purpose or puts up any\nshed or other structures or plant trees. Section 27(1)(e)(iv) of\nthe Act presrbies the punishment for a person, who trespasses\nupon such land.\n\n12. It is evident from the aforesaid provisions that\ncommission of any prohibited act even in a land proposed to be\ndeclared as a reserved forest would attract the offences\nmentioned above.\n\n13. Prima facie, there are materials to show that the\npetitioners had cut and destroyed the bamboo as well as the\nundergrowth from the disputed land. Whether the disputed land\nis forest area declared as a reserve forest or proposed to be\n\n2020/KER/81\nCr1.M.C.No.6072/2019 ;\ndeclared as a reserved forest and whether it is a land in the\nactual possession of the petitioners or not and whether the\npetitioners have got any right to be in possession of such land\netc. are matters which cannot be considered and decided in this\npetition filed under Section 482 Cr.P.C.\n\n14. It is well settled that, in a petition filed under Section\n482 Cr.P.C for quashing preliminary report of charge, this Court\nshall not embark upon the validity and reliability of the evidence\navailable. Factual disputes cannot be decided in a petition filed\nunder Section 482 CrP.C. All that the Court shall examine is\nwhether there are allegations in the first information report or\nthe complaint which form the basis to constitute the ingredients\nof the offences alleged against the accused.\n\n15. In the instant case, prima facie, the occurrence report\nand the mahazar prepared by the forest officers reveal the\nnecessary basic ingredients of the offences alleged against the\npetitioners. Therefore, the prayer in the petition for quashing the\nproceedings against the petitioners cannot be allowed. The\npetition is liable to be dismissed.\n\nFeel\n\n2020/KER/81\n\nCr1.M.C.No.6072/2019\n9\nConsequently, the petition is dismissed.\n(sd/-)\nR.NARAYANA PISHARADI, JUDGE\n\njsr\n\nCL rete a|\noo\nnee eae\nIsa\n2020/KER/81\nCr1.M.C.No.6072/2019\n10\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONERS\" EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE 1 BUILDING NUMBER ALLOTTED BY THE\nMANKULAM GRAMA PANCHAYATH TO THE 1ST\nPETITIONER.\nANNEXURE 2 BUILDING NUMBER ALLOTTED BY THE\nMANKULAM GRAMA PANCHAYATH TO THE 2ND\nPETITIONER.\nANNEXURE 3 TRUE COPY OF JUDGMENT DATED 8.4.2010 IN\nW.P.(C) NO. 14674/2007\nANNEXURE 4 TRUE COPY OF APPLICATION DATED\n11/7/2016 SUBMITTED BY THE 1ST\nPETITIONER BEFORE THE FOREST SETTLEMENT\nOFFICER, MANKULAM AND REVENUE\nDIVISIONAL OFFICER, DEVIKULAM.\nANNEXURE 5 CERTIFIED COPY OF THE FOREST OFFENCES\nSEIZURE REPORT (PRELIMINARY) , SUBMITTED\nBY THE RANGE FOREST OFFICER, MANKULAM\nBEFORE THE HON'BLE JUDICIAL FIRST CLASS\nMAGISTRATE COURT, DEVIKULAM.\nANNEXURE 6 TRUE COPY OF ORDER DATED 2.8.2019 IN\nCRL.M.C.
