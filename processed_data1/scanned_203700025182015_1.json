HARILAL, J.\nORDER\n\nThe petitioner is the sole accused in S.T.No.3335\nof 2010 on the files of the Additional Chief Judicial\nMagistrate' Court (E.O), Ernakulam, which was initiated\nat the instance of the 1* respondent, the wife of the\npetitioner, alleging an offence punishable under\nSection 31 of the Domestic Violence Act. Since the\npetitioner and the 1% respondent were residing\nseparately for the last more than four years, the\nrelatives and other family members intervened and\nsorted out the dispute between them. Pursuantly, they\nsettled the entire dispute between them and arrived at\na compromise.\n\n2. This petition is filed for quashing the entire\n\nBice asta\n2015/KER/17264\nCrl.M.C. No.2518 of 2015 2:\ncriminal prosecution initiated against the petitioner in\nCri.M.C.No.2081 of 2015 pending before the Judicial\nFirst Class Magistrate's Court, Kolenchery.\n\n3. The 1* respondent entered appearance\nthrough counsel.\n\n4. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner\nand the learned counsel for the 1* respondent.\n\n5. The learned counsel for the 1% respondent\nendorsed the submissions made by the _ learned\ncounsel for the petitioner. Both of them urged for\nquashing the’ prosecution against the petitioner in\nS.T.No.3335 of 2010 on the files of the Additional Chief\nJudicial Magistrate's Court (EO), Ernakulam, in\nexercise of the inherent power and jurisdiction under\nSec.482 of the Cr.P.C. In support of the said\nargument, the learned counsel for the petitioner cited\nthe decision in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4)\nKLT 108 (SC)].\n\n6. | have meticulously considered the decision in\nGian Singh v. State of Punjab [2012 (4) KLT 108 (SC)].\n\n2015/KER/17264\nCrl.M.C. No.2518 of 2015 a3e\nIn the above case, three Judge Bench of the Apex\nCourt, on aé reference, considered the question\nwhether the High Court has power to quash criminal\nproceedings involving non-compoundable offences on\nthe basis of the compromise reached between the\noffender and the victim and answered as given below:\n“57. The position that emerges\nfrom the above discussion can be\nsummarised thus: the power of the\nHigh Court in quashing a criminal\nproceeding or F.I.R. or complaint in\nexercise of its inherent jurisdiction is\ndistinct and different from the power\ngiven to a criminal court’ for\ncompounding the offences under\nS.320 of the Code. Inherent power is\nof wide plenitude with no statutory\nlimitation but it has to be exercised in\naccord with the guideline engrafted in\nsuch power viz;(1) to secure the ends\nof justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of\nthe process of any Court. In what\ncases power to quash the criminal\nproceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may\nbe exercised where the offender and\nvictim have settled their dispute\nwould depend on the facts and\n\n2015/KER/17264\nCrL.M.C. No.2518 of 2015 a4:\ncircumstances of each case and no\ncategory can be prescribed.\nHowever, before exercise of such\npower, the High Court must have due\nregard to the nature and gravity of\nthe crime. Heinous and_ serious\noffences of mental depravity or\noffences like murder, rape, dacoity,\netc., cannot be fittingly quashed even\nthough the victim or victim's family\nand the offender have settled the\ndispute. Such offences are not private\nin nature and have serious impact on\nsociety. Similarly, any compromise\nbetween the victim and offender in\nrelation to the offences under special\nstatutes like Prevention of Corruption\nAct or the offences committed by\npublic servants while working in that\ncapacity etc; cannot provide for any\nbasis for quashing criminal\nproceedings involving such offences.\nBut the criminal cases _ having\noverwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly\ncivil flavour stand on different footing\nfor the purposes of quashing,\nparticularly the offences arising from\ncommercial, financial, mercantile,\ncivil, partnership or such like\n\n2015/KER/17264\nCrl.M.C. No.2518 of 2015 Si\ntransactions or the offences arising\nout of matrimony relating to dowry,\netc., or the family disputes where the\nwrong is basically private or personal\nin nature and the parties have\nresolved their entire dispute. In this\ncategory of cases, High Court may\nquash criminal proceedings if in its\nview, because of the compromise\nbetween the offender and victim, the\npossibility of conviction is remote and\nbleak and continuation of criminal\ncase would put accused to great\nOppression and_ prejudice and\nextreme injustice would be caused to\nhim by not quashing the criminal\ncase despite full and complete\nsettlement and compromise with the\nvictim. In other words, the High Court\nmust consider whether it would be\nunfair or contrary to the interest of\njustice to continue with the criminal\nproceeding or continuation of the\ncriminal proceeding would\ntantamount to abuse of process of\nlaw despite settlement and\ncompromise between the victim and\nwrongdoer and whether to secure the\nends of justice, it is appropriate that\n\n2015/KER/17264\nCrl.M.C. No.2518 of 2015 -6:-\ncriminal case is put to an end and if\nthe answer to the above question(s)\nis in affirmative, the High Court shall\nbe well within its jurisdiction to quash\nthe criminal proceeding.”\n\n7. In view of the proposition laid down above, the\nquestion to be considered, in the instant case, is,\nwhether the non-compoundable offence involved in\nthis case can be compounded, in the exercise of the\ninherent power under Section 482 of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure. Prima facie, | find that the\noffences alleged against the petitioner will not come\nunder the category of non-compoundable offences,\nwhich are specifically excluded from composition, in\nthe exercise of inherent power under Sec.482 of the\nCr.P.C. Going by the affidavit filed by the de facto\ncomplainant, it is seen that the dispute between the\naccused and the victim had been amicably settled\nand, at present, the de facto complainant has no\nsubsisting grievance at all. The de facto complainant\ndoes not want to proceed with prosecution against the\n\nBal\n2015/KER/17264\n\nCrl.M.C. No.2518 of 2015 -7t-\n\naccused. Full and final settlement and compromise\nwith the victim are evidenced by Annexure-ll. In view\n\nof the compromise between the petitioner and the\nvictim, | find that the possibility of conviction is\nremote, bleak and continuation of the criminal case\nwould, put the parties to great oppression, prejudice\nand also tantamount to abuse of the process of the\ncourt. The present criminal prosecution against the\naccused must be put to an end to secure the interest\n\nof justice.\n\n8. In this analysis, the prosecution proceedings\nagainst the petitioner under Annexure-] complaint will\nstand quashed.\n\nThis petition is disposed of as above.\n\n(K. HARILAL, JUDGE)\nNan/\n\n"
