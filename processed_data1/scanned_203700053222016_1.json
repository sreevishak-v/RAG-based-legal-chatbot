The allegation against the petitioners is that he\nappeared at the bakery conducted by the defacto complainant\nand demanded an amount of Rs.2,000/- by threatening the\ndefacto complainant that licence from the Department of\nFactories and Boilers is required and if it is not taken, he would\nimpose a fine of Rs.1 Lakh.\n\n3. At any stretch of imagination the offence of\nextortion as defined under Section 384 IPC cannot be\nattracted. At the most, it is an attempt to commit misconduct\nwithin the meaning of the Prevention of Corruption Act.\nTherefore, an offence under Section 511 of Section 384 IPC is\nnot legally sustainable in this case. Matters being so,\nAnnexure-II FIR and all further proceedings based on it as\nagainst the petitioner is liable to be quashed.\n\nBLS\n# E wares\napa\n2018/KER/492\nCri.M.C.No.5322 of 2016 2\nIn the result, this Crl.M.C. is allowed and Annexure-II FIR\nand all further proceedings based on it as against the\npetitioner is hereby quashed.\nSd/-\nB.
