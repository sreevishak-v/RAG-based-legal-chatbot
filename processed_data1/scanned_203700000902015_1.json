The\noffence involved in the case is under Section 3(1)(x) of the\nScheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of\nAtrocities) Act (for short 'SC/ST Act').\n\n2. On the apprehension of arrest and remand to\njudicial custody, in execution of a warrant of arrest issued from\nthe court below, the petitioner seeks orders under Section 482 of\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure, quashing Annexure D order,\nconsequent to which warrant of arrest was issued against him. It\nis submitted that unfortunately the petitioner could not appear in\ncourt on a day only because he was admitted in a hospital at\nLucknow. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that\nserious allegations are not in fact there against the petitioner\nherein, and that the allegations in the final report will not attract\na prosecution under Section 3(1)(x) of the SC/ST Act. This\ngrievance will have to be seriously considered by the trial court.\n\nPel\na\n2015/KER/785\n\nCrl.M.C No.90 of 2015 2\nI do not think that this is a case of consistent absence during\ntrial. Absence on one or two posting dates cannot be seriously\ntaken by the trial court, and when application is filed to excuse\nabsence, the reasons stated by the accused will have to be\nconsidered by the trial court. I do not think that the learned\nSessions Judge will mechanically remand the petitioner to\njudicial custody when he appears or surrenders. If he has\nsatisfactory explanation for his absence, he can very well make\napplication for bail afresh, and it will be considered by the trial\ncourt. The petitioner's grievance, and also his explanation for\nhis absence, will have to be considered, and the trial court shall\nalso consider his submission that necessary elements and\ningredients of the offence under Section 3(1)(x) of the SC/ST Act\nare not there in the FIR and in the final report. If the petitioner\nhas satisfactory explanation for his absence, which of course was\nnot consistent at all, he can be released on bail, on appropriate\nconditions. However, the petitioner will have to surrender\nbefore the learned Sessions Judge and make application for bail\nafresh.\n\nIn the result, this Criminal Miscellaneous Case is\nclosed with a direction to the court below that if application for\n\nPel\na\n2015/KER/785\nCrl.M.C No.90 of 2015 3\nbail is filed by the petitioner, on surrender in S.C No.533/2010,\nthe same shall be judiciously considered, his grievance including\nthe reason for his absence shall also be seriously considered, and\nappropriate decision in the matter of bail shall be taken on the\ndate of surrender itself. The petitioner is granted time for ten\ndays to surrender before the trial court and make application for\nbail. In the meantime, execution of the warrant of arrest will\nstand suspended. As regards the relief sought with respect to\nthe steps taken by the court against the sureties, this Court\nobserves that in the particular facts and circumstances stated\nabove, appropriate judicious decision shall be taken by the trial\ncourt as to whether such procedure is absolutely necessary\nagainst the sureties.\nP.UBAID\nJUDGE\nab\n\n"
