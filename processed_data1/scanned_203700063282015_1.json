The allegation of the prosecution is that on 24.11.2014\nat about 10 a.m. the accused came in a swift car driven by the\nsecond petitioner and when it reached the check post, the first\npetitioner, who was sitting on the rear side of the car, opened the\ndoor and asked the second respondent, who was standing on the\nroad side, to enter the car. She was then forcefully taken by hand\nand pulled into the car by the first petitioner. She was allegedly\nabducted with the intention of making sex. In the meanwhile,\npolice is stated to have intervened and a complaint was taken from\nher. Crime was registered and after investigation, final report was\nlaid and the matter is now pending as C.C.No.442 of 2015.\n\n3. The first petitioner herein contended that she was\nknown to him and that, they were voluntarily travelling in a\nvehicle. It was further contended that certain other persons\n\n2\n2016/KER/33896\nCrl.M.C.6328/15\n2\nintervened in the issue and informed the police. To substantiate it,\nfirst petitioner herein had produced certain photographs of the\nsecond respondent individually as well as jointly with her in a\nvehicle.\n\n4. The second respondent has now filed an affidavit dated\n25.06.2016 swearing that the criminal proceedings were initiated\non the basis of a complaint laid by her. The matter is now settled\nbetween the parties and due to the intervention of her relatives\nand other mediators, she has stated that she does not intend to\nproceed against the petitioners. Evidently, the affidavit has been\nfiled by her after having perused the complaint and the\nphotographs, which have also been produced along with the\nCrl.M.C.\n\n5. In the light of the above, the second respondent had\nconsciously and knowingly stated that she has no grievance\nagainst the petitioners, thereby affecting the substratum of the\nprosecution case. Learned counsel for the second respondent also\nendorsed the averments in the affidavit and submitted that in the\ninterest of both sides, the case should be given a decent burial. In\nthe light of the above submissions and the affidavit filed, I feel that\nthe matter can be given a quietus.\n\nBiel\nape\n2016/KER/33896\nCrl.M.C.6328/15\n3\nIn the result, Crl.M.C is allowed. Entire proceedings\narising from Crime No.550 of 2014 of Badiyadukka Police Station\nstand quashed.\nSd/-\nSUNIL THOMAS\nJudge\nSbna/3/8/16\nTrue Copy /\nPA to Judge\n\n"
