CASE HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON\n08.01.2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:\n\nMe\noa\nCRL.M.C.No.4991 of 2019 2 202 1/KER/1275\nORDER\nDated this the 8th day of January 2021\n\nThe petitioner is the 3** accused in C.C.No.10\nof 2018 on the file of the Chief Judicial\nMagistrate Court, Kottayam.\n\n2. The above case was taken on file based on\nAnnexure-A private complaint.\n\n3. The case of the complainant is that,\naccused Nos.1 and 2 forged the signature of one\nN.T. Francis, brother of accused No.1 and the 1**\nrespondent on two vakalathnamas filed before the\nSub Court, Kottayam on its transfer from Sub\nCourt, Pala. The learned Magistrate took\ncognizance for the offences under Sections 468\nand 471 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The\nprayer in this petition is to quash the\nproceedings against the petitioner.\n\n4. Heard the learned counsel for the\npetitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor.\n\noa\nCRL.M.C.No.4991 of 2019 3 202 1/KER/1275\n\n5. The learned counsel for the petitioner\nsubmitted that, the 1% accused in Annexure-A\ncomplaint approached this Court for quashing the\nproceedings and as per the order dated 17.1.2019\nin Crl.M.C.No.5812 of 2018 this Court quashed the\nentire proceedings against the 1** accused. The\ncounsel submitted that, in the light of the\nabove judgment, the substratum of this case\ndestroyed and the continuance of the prosecution\nagainst the petitioner herein is an abuse of\nprocess of law.\n\n6. After hearing both sides, I think, there\nis some force in the argument of the petitioner.\nThis Court, after considering the entire aspects,\nquashed the proceedings against the 1** accused\nas per the judgment dated 17.1.2019 in\nCr1.M.C.No.5812 of 2018. The relevant portion of\nthe judgment is extracted hereunder:\n\n“5. I have perused Annexure-Q complaint\nand Annexure-R sworn statement of the first\nrespondent given under section 200 Cr.P.C. In\n\nie\nCRL.M.C.No.4991 of 2019 4 2021/KER/1275\n\nthe complaint it is stated that the vakalaths\nallegedly containing the forged signature of\nFrancis were sent for examination and the\nfirst respondent knew that the signatures are\nnot genuine. This is strange. The vakaiths\nhave been in the custody of the Sub Court.\nHow the first respondent could send it for\nexamination. And it is not disclosed who sent\nthem or to whom they were sent for\nexamination.\n\n6. In the Annexure-R sworn statement the\nfirst respondent has no case of sending the\nvakalaths for examination. In Annexure-Q\ncomplaint it is stated that petitioner forged\nthe signatures of the Francis in the\nvakalaths and handed them to his advocate. It\nis not disclosed how he came to know about\nit.\n\n7. In Annexure-Q complaint it is stated\nthat Francis is an alshimers patient, he\ncannot remember even his name and cannot\nrecognize any one. Sworn statement of one\nDr.Joseph Sebastian was recorded during the\nenquiry. He stated that since April 2015\nFrancis has been under his treatment for\nalshimers and loss of memory and inability to\ndo things properly are its characteristics.\nThe vakalaths in the Sub Court were executed\non 02.03.2016 and 08.02.2017.\n\n&. Merely because Francis is an\nalshimers patient it cannot be said that the\n\nMe\nCRL.M.C.No.4991 of 2019 5 2021/KER/1275\n\nSignatures in the vakalath are not genuine.\nThe only allegation in the sworn statement of\nthe first respondent is that the Francis is\nan alshimers patient, he is laid up and he\ncannot recognize anyone. That is the only\nbasis for him to allege that the signatures\nof Francis are not genuine. The doctor has no\ncase that Francis was not able to put his\nsignature. What he has said is that Francis\ncannot understand the nature of the documents\nhe execute. That may may be a good reason to\nhold that the vakalath is not valid, but not\na good reason to take the view that the\nsignature in it is not genuine.\n\n9. The complaint was filed when the\nsuits came up for trial. The first respondent\nfiled Annexure N and O applications in the\nSub Court, Kottayam to appoint the petitioner\nguardian of Francis. This is very significant\nin nature of the case. In Annexure-N and O\naffidavit the first said that the petitioner\n\"has no interest adverse to the interest\" of\nFrancis and they filed joint written\nstatement. While the two suits were pending\nin the Sub Court, Pala the first respondent\nfiled an affidavit stating that Francis\nforged his (first respondent’s) signature in\na settlement deed.\n\n10. The discussion made above compels me\nto hold that there are no sufficient grounds\nto proceed with the complaint. It is liable\n\nBaal\n—\nBP) A E.\nCRL.M.C.No.4991 of 2019 6 202UKER/1275\nto be quashed.\nIn the result, this Crl.M.C is allowed.\nThe proceedings in C.C.No.10 of 2018 on the\nfile of the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court\nKottayam are quashed so far as the petitioner\nis concerned.”\n\n7. j%rIn the light of the above finding of this\nCourt, I think, the prosecution against the\npetitioner is an abuse of process of law.\n\nTherefore, this Crl.M.cC. is allowed. All\nfurther proceedings against the petitioner in\nC.C.No.10 of 2018 on the file of the Chief\nJudicial Magistrate Court, Kottayam are quashed.\n\nSd/-\nP.V.KUNHIKRISHNAN\npkk JUDGE\n\nniga\no\nBP) * =\nCRL.M.C.No.4991 of 2019 7 202U/KER/1275\nAPPENDIX\nPETITIONER'S/S EXHIBITS:\nANNEXURE A CERTIFIED COPY OF THE COMPLAINT IN\nC.M.P.NO.3528/2017 FILED BEFORE THE CHIEF\nJUDICIAL MAGISTRATE COURT, KOTTAYAM,\nDATED 3.8.2017.\nANNEXURE B TRUE COPY OF THE SWORN STATEMENT OF THE\nCOMPLAINT IN C.M.P.NO.3528/2017 BEFORE\nTHE CHIEF JUDICIAL MAGISTRATE COURT,\nKOTTAYAM, DATED 3.8.2018.\nANNEXURE C TRUE COPY OF THE SWORN STATEMENT OF\nDR.JOSEPH SEBASTIAN DATED 13.9.2017 IN\nC.M.P.NO.3528/2017 BEFORE THE CHIEF\nJUDICIAL MAGISTRATE COURT, KOTTAYAM.\nANNEXURE D TRUE COPY OF THE JUDGMENT OF THIS HO'BLE\nCOURT IN CRL.M.C.NO.5812/2018 DATED\n17.1.2019.\nANNEXURE E TRUE COPY OF THE AFFIDAVIT FILED BY SHIJI\nFRANCIS IN CRL.M.C.NO.5812/2018 DATED\n3.9.2018.\n//TRUE COPY//\nSD/-\nP.S.
