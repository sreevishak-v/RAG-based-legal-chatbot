No. 62 of 2008\non the files of the court below. The above case arose out of\nAnnexure-Al complaint filed by the 2\"? respondent before\nthe court below against the petitioner alleging offence\nunder Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881\n(“the N.I.Act” for short).\n\n2. The petitioner has filed this Crl. M.C. praying\nfor quashing Annexure-Al complaint and _ further\nproceedings in the above case.\n\n3. Service is complete. However, there is no\nappearance for the 2\" respondent. Heard the learned\ncounsel for the petitioner and the learned Public\n\nDesa\n2018/KER/238\n-2-\nCri.M.C. No. 918 of 2016\nProsecutor.\n\n4. The learned counsel for the petitioner has\nsubmitted that eventhough the matter was settled between\nthe parties, the 2\"? respondent did not incline to withdraw\nAnnexure-Al complaint and in the said circumstances, the\npetitioner is constrained to approach this Court with the\nabove Crl. M.C. Annexure-A2 would show that the matter\nhas been settled between the parties. The petitioner\nproduced before this Court the original cheque No. 551366\ndated 3-10-2005 for Rs. 2,50,000/-, which is the cheque\nreferred to in Annexure-Al complaint. Since the petitioner\nhas produced the original cheque before this Court, that\nitself would indicate that no successful prosecution against\nthe petitioner pursuant to Annexure-Al complaint can be\nsustained. Therefore, no purpose will be served even if\nthe prosecution against the petitioner is permitted to be\ncontinued. For the said reason, I am inclined to quash\nAnnexure-Al complaint and further proceedings against\n\nBt\npees\n2018/KER/238\n-3-\nCri.M.C. No. 918 of 2016\nthe petitioner in L.P No. 62 of 2008 in C.C.

M.C. stands allowed.\nSd/-B. SUDHEENDRA KUMAR, JUDGE.\nani/\n\n"
